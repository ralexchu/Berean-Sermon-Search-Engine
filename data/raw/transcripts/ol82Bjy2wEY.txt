[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> All right, good morning, Green Community Church.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Welcome to our online service and for those of you who are guests or joining us for worship.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I know we're all kind of getting antsy to see when things are gonna be opened up and
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   we can get back to church.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I think we're gonna have more specific announcements that are coming sooner than
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   later.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But I think right now with all the stuff that's going on, our leaders,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   the president, the governors, the local mayors,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   they're in lead of a lot of our prayers because the decisions that they make are very weighty.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   We need a lot of prayer for even the church pastors where we're kind of wrestling with
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   how do we keep our church safe?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   How do we submit to the governing authorities?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   How do we do so in a way that honors God and
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that we're not compromising the convictions that we have in scripture?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And so we're in prayer, we're having a lot of discussions and
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   we do have some announcements that we do want to give you.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I know that California has gone into phase two and there are a lot of rumblings,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   especially within the church, as to when can we open up.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   There's been a movement within the whole country and specifically in California of
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   churches where many churches, thousands of churches are planning to open up on May 31st.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And again, it is not a hard line time and I know that there is a movement.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We are talking to our denominations, we're talking to other churches to see how we're going to do this together.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We want to do it in a way that again honors God and do our best to submit to the governing authorities
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and we want to keep the church as safe as possible.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And so starting from, okay, and this is not a hard date, but starting from May 31st and
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   possibly a week or two after that, and we'll give you the specific dates when we can,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   but starting from, we're hoping to shoot from May 31st that we will be able to have our live service at the church.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And we are planning to have three services, at least in the beginning, 830, 1030, and 1230.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   We've already emptied out the room so that we have plenty of space in between.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And so in order to not to create traffic in one service, we're going to ask the church to sign up for one of them
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   and to commit to that service for the duration of the time that we need to do this.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   So after our service, there's going to be a, it's going to be up on the Facebook where you can commit.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And again, even if you're not a member of the church and you want to sign up and just kind of let us know
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   that that's the service that you're planning to attend, there will be a place where you can sign up and say,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   you know, my first choice is 830, my second choice is 1030 or something like that.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So if we need to add a fourth service, if I can survive, we may plan to do that,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   but we're going to see if we can do this with three services.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So again, it would be at 830, 1030, and 1230.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So after we get all of that signed up, the following week on Sunday, on May 17th,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   we do have a members meeting where we're going to announce to you more specifically what we are planning to do.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So again, all of this is tentative. We're just kind of watching the news and praying and talking to other churches
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   to see what needs to be done. And so as we get more information, we'll let you know.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   But again, for now, we are tentatively planning to have our first open service on May 31st.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And again, by next Sunday, that may change, but that's kind of like what we're coordinating with other churches to do right now.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Okay. All right. And again, like I said, along with that, there will be more announcements that will be coming next Sunday.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   So please, if you are a member of the church, please attend that.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And those of you who may be in the process of becoming members or you just haven't officially become a member,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   but you plan to attend church, all of the announcements that we give to our members will be given on our Facebook page.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   So please visit that afterwards and you'll get all the information that you need on that site.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Okay. All right. I have a business to take care of this morning.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   We have special birthdays that are going on. Again, I want to correct what was said wrong last week.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I said Adam Wong and that was the wrong name. It was Adam Chong.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Happy birthday. George Wu's birthday is coming up this week.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Happy birthday. Casey Lin's birthday. Adalyn Chang's birthday. Katie Lee's birthday.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And Owen Chang. He's one year old. Hopefully he'll remember.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Okay. Happy birthday for all of you coming up. And then this is the good boy and good girls list.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Okay. Uriah Kim. Good job, buddy. Brooklyn and Adrian Wong. Good job. Keep up the good work.

[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Chloe Lin. Your parents said you guys, you did a great job last week.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   We have Danielle, Tim, Seth and Nikki Irving. You guys also did a great job.

[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Okay. Keep up the good work. All right. Let me pray for the offering and then we'll jump into the worship this morning.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Let's pray. Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for sustaining us, for loving us, for calling us and saving us.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I pray, Father, this morning that not only here at Berean, but all over the world, that your name may be magnified.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And especially for those around the world who may not yet know you, but they're earnestly searching.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I pray that you would guide them to gospel messages that are online.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   That would cause them to open their eyes to see the glory of who you are.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And I pray, Father God, that the resurrection of Christ and the power, Lord God, that resurrected him
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   would also be powerful, Father God, in the messages that go out.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   We pray for our family members. We pray for friends and guests who are worshiping together with us.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   May Christ and his voice and his voice alone be made clear that we may hear our Master's voice and follow him this morning.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   [Piano music]
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Let us all rise as we begin our praises.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   [Piano music]
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Speak, O Lord, as we come to you to receive the fruit of your holy word.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Deck the earth with your truth, plant it deep in us, shape and fashion us in your light.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   The light of Christ might be seen today in our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Teach us, Lord, full obedience, holy reverence, true humility.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your purity.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see your majestic love and authority.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Words of power that can never fail, let their truth prevail over unbelief.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds. Help us grasp the heights of your plans for us.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And truth shall unchange from the dawn of time that will never go down through eternity.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And thy grace will stand on your promises, and thy faith will walk as you walk with us.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Speak, O Lord, till your church is built and the earth is filled with your fruit.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And thy grace will stand on your promises, and thy faith will walk as you walk with us.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Speak, O Lord, till your church is built and the earth is filled with your glory.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has ever conceived
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   the glorious things that you have prepared for everyone who has believed.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You brought us near and you called us your own and made us your heirs with your Son.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   How high and how low, how deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, O Lord.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Take some mercy, take some mercy, who shall have no wrath and let none speak of all joy?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Who will share the wisdom and search of the wild, no wonder unknowing your voice.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You are our treasure and our great reward, our hope and our glorious King.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   How high and how low, how deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, O Lord.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   How high and how low, how deep and how long, how sweet and how strong is your love.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   How lavish your grace, how faithful your ways, how great is your love, O Lord.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   How great is your love, O Lord.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Just the time.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's gone.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I feel at ease, I feel at home and I know I'm not alone.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Then in my rest there comes a test that shakes me to the ground, I know.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   That what I have is not enough and I know I've got to go.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   The full supply.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   The full supply I find as I move closer to the heart of God.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   To strengthen me, to nourish me and to fill my mind with you.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I've truly grown but even so my hunger hasn't gone away.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Still I long, still I thirst to know and know each day.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who are participating today.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I know especially with the quarantine and all the kids being homeschooled, you're working overtime.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And so we're praying for you. We're thankful for you.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And you know, typically when we think about God's agape love,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   the closest thing that most people can think of is the love that they receive from their mothers.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And so again, obviously, even the mother's love cannot compare to the love that we receive from God the Father.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   But as people, you know, the closest that we typically experience is usually from our mothers.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So again, we want to thank you for all the hard work that you're putting in,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   especially now as you're homeschooling, you know, taking care of the home
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   and just working overtime right now more than any other period.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   We do have a special video to celebrate Mother's Day, but we're not going to be watching it online.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   It's going to be put up on Facebook. It's a little bit longer than I think normal.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   So after the service or whenever you have time today or even tomorrow,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   you can just go and just watch that on your own time.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   But again, we do have a special video that our media team created for us.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   OK, if you can turn your Bibles to John chapter 15, and we're actually going to be floating around John chapter,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   you know, latter part of 14, 15, and then the beginning part of chapter 16.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   But again, we're going to be there's a lot to cover and I'm not going to be able to cover all of it today.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   This text is so rich with so many good things that Christ was trying to teach them before he left.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And so but the main text that we're going to be looking at is starting from verse one through 11.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So let me read that before we pray and then jump into the sermon.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   You're already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   If you abide in me, my words abide in you. Ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   My father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you. Abide in my love.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   If you keep my commandments, you abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandment and abide in his love.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Let's pray.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray for your anointing over this time.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   We pray, Father God, that your living word that you invested and poured your very breath into,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that we may be the beneficiary of your word this morning.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to illumine us, open our eyes, Lord God,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   that we may understand and that our hearts may be moldable.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   As you are the powder and we are the clay.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And we desire to be molded by your word this morning.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   [Silence]
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   If you had maybe, you know, six hours, you know, or seven hours,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and you knew that you were going to depart from your loved ones,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   what are the final words that you would say?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   What are some instructions that you would give?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And if you're parents, like, what would you say to your children?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Whatever it may be, my guess is you're not going to be frivolous.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   That every word that you say is going to have meaning.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   You're going to think through all the things that you have learned,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   all the things that you wish that your children would understand.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And most likely you're going to give them some instructions.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Whether they understand it or not, you're going to give some instructions to them.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   My guess is that you're not going to be telling a joke for your last thing that you want to say, right?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   You know, this week we--our brother Lee, his father passed away last week
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   and had a funeral on Monday.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And we were--a few of us, the pastors and a few people,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   were able to participate from a distance, obviously because of all that was going on.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And one of the things that he said was that his father, before he passed away,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   was in the state of mind where he was able to write a letter to each one of his children
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and his loved one, and just telling them that he loves them
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   and then just giving them fatherly advice, last fatherly advice.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And when I heard that, I said, "Wow, that's really awesome."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And each one of those letters are probably something that each of their children
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and loved ones are going to cherish for the rest of their lives.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And I was just kind of curious what he wrote because, you know,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   whatever he writes there is going to be very weighty.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It's going to take a lot--he probably took a lot of time thinking about his 80-plus,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   the 87 years or so of his life that he's accumulated through all the sufferings
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and through the Korean War, immigration, and the hardship,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and living as a faithful Christian man for so many decades.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And so all of that accumulated in that one letter instructing their children
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that make sure that you understand this.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, the text that we're looking at this morning, in a way,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   is Jesus' last teaching that he's leaving to his disciples.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   You know, what he says here is taking place right after he has the Lord's Supper.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And then he's instructed them that one of them are going to betray them,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and so Judas takes off to go get the temple guards
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   so that they can come in the middle of the night to take him away.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And so it was in between that time, before they go to the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   where he wrestles in prayer, and then he gets arrested after that,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and then he heads to the cross.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   So really, this is the last thing that he says to his disciples
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   until after he resurrects, and then he commissions them to the Great Commission.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   So you can imagine how important these words are,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   because this was not given to the public.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This was given specifically to his disciples as instructions
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   that after I leave, you make sure that you do this.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Now, this is the seventh, the last of the I Am statements,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   the seven I Am statements that we went through.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And if you look at it superficially, you may say,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   "Wow, there's so many profound and great things that Jesus says in the I Am statements."
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And I would think that maybe a good way to leave,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and the last thing that he would say to his disciples is,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   "I am the resurrection and the life,"
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   because he's about to go to the cross, and he's about to die,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and to leave them with that, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Maybe even what he said last week, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   No one goes to the Father but through me."
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   But those were the fifth and sixth, and then the seventh, the last one, "I am the vine."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And this was the last thing that he says to them.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   This is the last thing that he wanted to make sure he clarifies to his disciples
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   before he goes to the cross.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I mean, it almost sounds mundane superficially
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   if you don't really understand what he is saying.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   He's not simply saying that, "I am the vine.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   You can connect to me if you want to bear fruit."
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Again, as important as that is, the reason why he says that
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   is because he's preparing them to leave.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   He's preparing to leave them,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and he wanted them to make sure that they understood.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   My guess is that if you were to write a last letter
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   that you're going to write to your children,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   you're going to have a lot of maybe life wisdom
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   to teach them how to be successful in life.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Work hard.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Make sure you're good to people.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Make sure you're kind.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Whatever it is, life instructions,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   you're probably going to leave behind things
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   that you think are going to help your children to be successful.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Well, chapter 15 is all about bearing fruit.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   He just told them that he was about to leave,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   but he's also instructing them that, "After I leave,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   if you want to continue to bear fruit, this is what you need to do."
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And so the whole chapter 15 is about Christians bearing fruit.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   After he leaves, he wanted them to continue to do the work that he started,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   to continue to spread the gospel, build churches.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But he's telling them that you cannot bear this fruit on your own.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   As Christians, and not even just as Christians,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   in anything that we do,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   if you start a business and it doesn't do well,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   you're not bearing fruit.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You're not going to do that for too long.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   If you have a relationship, that doesn't bear fruit,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   meaning that it's not reciprocated.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It's just completely one-sided.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You're not going to endure it for too long.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   If you go to school and you put in your time,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   and you go to school and you're staying up at night
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and trying to do your paper,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   and at the end of it, you're not making any progress.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   You're not passing your classes.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It's like, "Maybe this is not for me."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Whatever it is that you do, whether it's sports, business, relationship, or school,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   whatever you do, if you don't see tangible fruit,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   eventually, you'll lose interest.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And you'll probably pack up your bags and try to do something else.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And it is no different with our faith.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   If at some point in our endeavor,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   memorizing Scripture and trying to pray, coming to church,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   if we don't begin to see some progress in the things that we are doing,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   eventually, we lose interest.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   We may not physically walk out of the church,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   but internally, we have no expectations.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   We just kind of do it.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Hopefully, we can just make it, and we just become very nominal Christians
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   without any goals, without any purpose,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and no expectations to ever bear fruit.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And we kind of use cliche things like God loves us exactly the way we are.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   All of these things may be true,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   but we kind of revert back to that in order to excuse a life that is fruitless.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And so internally, we don't have any excitement.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Maybe that died way back in college, or maybe when you were younger,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   maybe before you had kids, before you started, had a full-time job,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   whatever it might be, this vision, this idea that we're going to bear fruit,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   we're going to expand or get the kingdom of God all over the world.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   For whatever the reason, many Christians fall away from that,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and then they just kind of learn to go through the motion.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I just do my part, and I just make it to next year,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and then outside of just going to church on Sunday
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and then participating in events, there really isn't this striving after God.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   What Jesus is saying here is not a distinguishing mark
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   between a good Christian and a bad Christian.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   That's the first thing that we need to understand.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He's making a distinguishing mark between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   because he doesn't say, "If you want to bear fruit, you should do these things,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   and hopefully you can do a good job and bear more fruit."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   John 15, 2, it says, "Every branch of me that does not bear fruit, he takes away."
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Meaning it gets chopped down.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   "And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit."
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Again, in chapter 15, verse 16, "If anyone does not abide in me,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   he is thrown away as a branch and dries up,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Again, many people misunderstand this text as in God is giving wise instructions
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   as to Christians so that we can bear more fruit, which is also true.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   But fundamentally what Jesus is telling his disciples,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   the distinguishing mark between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   is that a Christian bears fruit and a non-Christian bears no fruit.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   There is no evidence of their faith in their life.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   So what he is saying to his disciples are the identifying mark of a true believer.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So again, it's very, very important that we understand what he is saying.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   But as important as bearing fruit is, as an identifying mark of a Christian,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   the imperative in this passage is not bear fruit.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Meaning God's ultimate command is not "Go bear fruit."
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Because if you're not a fruit tree and you're trying to bear fruits,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   how are you going to feel?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   What kind of success are you going to have?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Zero.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   You don't plant a grape vine or a peach tree or an apple tree
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   and then expect pineapples to come out.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   You're frustrated when only pineapples come out or maybe no fruits come out.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   The imperative in this passage is not "Go bear fruit."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   The imperative in this passage is "How do we bear fruit?"
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   So that's why he says, "I am the true vine."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   He's telling them how to bear fruit.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   That after I leave, up to now, you've been just doing whatever I told you to do.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   If I went to Jerusalem, you came with me.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   If I healed the sick, you helped me.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   If I fed the people who were hungry, you carried it and you did my work.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   But now I'm going to leave.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   And they're all freaking out like, "Where are you going?"
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   So he's answering that question, "Why can't we go with you?"
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   The disciples are distraught.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   "What's going to happen to us after you leave?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   How are we going to continue the work?"
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   So he's telling them that in order to bear fruit, you must remain in me.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   That's the "I am" statement that he's making to his disciples.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   That I am the vine.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   If you want to bear fruit, you must abide in me.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   In fact, John himself uses the word "meno," which is translated for "abide" in this passage,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   50 times in his letters. 50 times.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   So John repeats it in his letters over and over and over again
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   that if we want to bear fruit, we must abide in Christ.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   And that's in this text alone, in chapter 15.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   He uses the word "meno" to abide 11 separate times.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   So if you were to read chapter 11 and you have a highlighter,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   every time he uses the word "abide," highlight it.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Because it'll tell you every time you flip that chapter, chapter 15,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   the highlighter will tell you, "Oh, he's talking about abiding in Christ."
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   It's not necessarily, "Go bear fruit."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   It's like, "No, you can't bear fruit unless you abide."
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   So this word "abide" is a very key word because Jesus is saying
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that distinguishing mark between a Christian and a non-Christian is abiding.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   For you to be able to bear fruit and continue to do the work that I am sending you to do,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   you must abide.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   In order for you to have any success in your Christian walk with God,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   you must abide.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So this word "abide" is a key word in our walk with God.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Just like the word "love," right?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   We have "agape" and in the Bible it's very precise.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   So you have family love, you have romantic love, right?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   You have different familial love, right?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   But the love that God gives us is the "agape," unconditional love.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   So it's a very precise word.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   So if you've been a Christian for a while, you probably already have heard
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   many times the word "agape" because it's crucial.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   It's foundation to our understanding of our relationship with God.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   He agape'd us.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   This word "meno" is just as crucial because we are children of God
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   because He agape'd us and then the instruction that He leaves with the disciples,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   "If you do not meno with me, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   You cannot walk with God.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   There is no assurance of salvation."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   So how important is this word "meno"?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   In fact, just like the word "agape," in English we say "love,"
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   whether it's family, chocolate, or God's love, we use the same word.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   So we have to explain the word.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Well, this word, again, it's a rich word that really can't be translated with one word.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So in the NASB it's translated "abide."
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   In some of the other translations it's translated "to remain."
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   And then in other parts of the Bible, in other translations, it'll say "to dwell."
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   In some other translations it'll say "to continue."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   You'll see about five or six or even seven different translations of this word,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   and some of them are very similar and some of them are very different.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   But the reason why it's so different, and whenever you study the Bible
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   and you look at the different translations and the word that is translated
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   sounds very different, that already indicates to you that that Greek word
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   doesn't have a precise translation in the English,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and that's why they did their best for whatever context that they used to use that word.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Well, this word "meno" is translated five or six different ways in different translations.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   So it is a very rich word that connects us to God,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   connects us to Christ, that causes us to bear fruit.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   So we're going to be talking about, again, three, just to kind of give you an outline,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   we're going to give you three insights.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   The most important part of it is the first one,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   but under each of these there's going to be sub-points, so just kind of stay with me.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   If you look at the children's outline, it'll show you what the outline is.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   The first thing that I want to point out is that Jesus is divine, so we must abide in him.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   And he says, "I am the true vine," right?
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   The last of the seven "I am" statements.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   But the immediate question that the disciples probably would have asked is,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   "You just told us that you're going to leave and we cannot follow you."
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   And then when we said, "Well, why can't we follow you? What about us?"
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And you answer, "You have to abide in me. You have to stay with me.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You have to continue with me. You have to dwell with me. You have to remain with me."
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Well, how do we do that if you're going to leave?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Why are you teasing us?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   If you're leaving, we can't abide in you.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   See, it's that question that he's trying to answer.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   What does it mean to abide in Christ in the context of him leaving?
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   So again, if you didn't get a lot of sleep last night and you're kind of coming in and out,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and you missed this, I'm telling you right now, you're going to miss the whole sermon.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Not only are you going to miss the whole sermon, I told you this word "meno" is key to your walk with God.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Right? And so you're not going to understand. You could possibly, and again,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   I don't mean to over-exaggerate, but if you don't understand this,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   you can possibly spend all your life trying to bear fruit by your own power and be frustrated,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   which is where many of you might be today.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   "I'm trying so hard, but I don't feel like I'm going anywhere. Why is this?"
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Well, Jesus is going to answer that.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   What does it mean to abide in Christ to bear fruit?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   If he's the true vine, and I need to connect with him.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Well, if you've ever studied the Gospel of John, you may already know that chapter 14, 15, and 16
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   of the Gospel of John has one of the most extensive and the clearest teaching of the role of the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Typically, when we think of the Holy Spirit, we think of him as an "it."
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Right? Like some power source, like the electricity.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   But we already know, if you've been a Christian for a while, that he is the third person of the Trinity.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   He is a being. Like Christ is a being. Like God the Father is a being.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   But we take glimpses of, usually the Holy Spirit is kind of mentioned in the background, doing the work.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   And so we kind of see him as electricity.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   But again, the clearest teaching about the personhood of the Holy Spirit that's condensed
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   is in chapter 14, 15, and 16.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   The reason why I say this is because Jesus is connecting the dwelling that he is telling them to dwell with him
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   with the fulfillment in the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Let me say this again.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   He is going to leave, but someone else is going to come who's going to dwell in you that you must dwell.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   So you're going to dwell in me by dwelling with him.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Hopefully you caught that. So if you missed that part, the rest of it is going to be confusing.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Not confusing, but it'll be harder than normal.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   So again, stay with me.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   This is what he says.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   I am the true vine, and then in verse 14 he explains, knowing that the disciples may be asking,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   how are we going to abide in you? How are we going to stay with you if you're leaving?
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He says, verse 16, chapter 14 of John,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, that he may be with you forever.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Now why does he say that? Because he said he's going to leave.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   If you leave, how are we going to abide?
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Another one's going to come, but that other one who's going to come isn't going to ever leave you.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   I have to leave you, but he comes and he's going to stay with you forever.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   That is the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   because this does not see him or know him, but you know him because he abides with you
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   and will be in you, and I will not leave you as orphans.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   I will come to you.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   So notice what he says here.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   He says, first of all, he says, I am leaving.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   You need to abide in me if you want to bear fruit.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   So well, how are we going to do that?
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Well, God's going to send another helper.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   When he comes, he's going to stay with you forever.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   So even though I may leave, what does he say?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I will be with you.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   In other words, when he says to abide in him, he's introducing the Holy Spirit that they may abide with him.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And by abiding with him, you will be abiding with me.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Did you catch that?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   So he's using the presence of the Holy Spirit and his presence interchangeably.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Okay, so this is a very important text about the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   So let me highlight three things that he says about the Holy Spirit here.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Okay, first of all, the word that he uses when he says he will give you another helper.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   In the Greek, there are two words that can be translated another.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   First word is the word alos, which is the word that is used here.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   And it means another of the same kind.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Let's say as an example, if a police officer is on the scene and that police officer has to go,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and he says, "Well, I need to go, but another police officer is going to come, and he's going to continue to help you."
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   That's the word alos.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   There's another word of another kind, in quality, and that's heteros.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Both words can be translated another, but the word that he uses here is alos.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   So if the other one that is coming is different than him, then he would have used the word heteros.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   But by using the word alos, he's saying as he is equal to the Father,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   another equal to me, who is just like me, is coming to continue the work that I started with you.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   So in other words, Jesus was equating the Holy Spirit with him.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And he equated himself with the Father, so he is saying, in a sense, "I am not leaving you."
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Just as the Father didn't abandon you and sent me, I am not abandoning you, and I will send the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   His role, the Holy Spirit's role, is not different from Jesus.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   In other words, I am not abandoning you.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   In John 16, 7, "But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away."
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Think about that if you're disciples and you're hearing him.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   This is the Messiah.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   This is the guy who raises people from the dead.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   This is the guy who walks on waters and then calms the storms just by his word.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   And he says, "I am going, you cannot follow me, but in fact, it's better for you if I go,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   because until I go, he will not come."
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   So in other words, what he's saying is the coming of the Holy Spirit is actually more beneficial for you
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   than if I have stayed.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   How often have you thought, "Man, it would have been awesome, you know,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   it would have been awesome to be on earth when Jesus was walking this earth, right?
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   It would have been great to be in Jerusalem when he was at the temple,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   if I was there and I ate the miraculous bread and the fish, right?"
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   I mean, we probably all have thought that, and that's why so many people will pay lots of money
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   to go to Jerusalem and walk on the streets that he walked on and look at the trees
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   and the scenery that he enjoyed.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   But Jesus says, "It's better for you," meaning better for all of us, "that he left."
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Our current situation is better than the situation that the disciples were in
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   when Jesus was saying this to them.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   That's a pretty radical statement.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   In other words, the Holy Spirit that's going to come is going to do mightier things in us
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   than if when Jesus was here in person.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   That's pretty radical.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Well, when he comes, what does he do?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   What is his primary work?
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   John, right?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   In John chapter 1, 14, he says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Right? Talking about Jesus.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Well, the Word dwelt here.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   And again, like I said, if you are tired, you may have already gone over your head, right?
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   But I'm trying to give you the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   and the transition that Jesus is making to the disciples and how important this is.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Because this is the center of what Jesus came to do.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   He said, "Christ came and he dwelt among us."
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   The word "dwelt" here is not meno.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Even the word meno has the idea of dwelling.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   But the word "dwell" here is the word literally to pitch a tent.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   So when Christ came, he came into our campground,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   he took on our flesh, and he lived among us.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Right? He lived among us.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   But of the Holy Spirit, he says in John chapter 14, 17,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   "This is the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   because it does not see him or know him.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   But you know him because he abides with you and will be in you."
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   The distinction between Jesus' dwelling and the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Jesus came and he pitched a tent among us.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   In other words, he came and was in the campground with us.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   He walked with us, he lived with us, he ate with us.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But the Holy Spirit, he's going to come and he's going to indwell in us.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   He didn't just pitch a tent.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Our union with the Holy Spirit is that he indwells in us.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Do you understand the distinction?
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And that's why Jesus was saying, "It is better for you that I leave,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   because I'm only here to pitch a tent with you,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   but I'm going so that the Holy Spirit can come and actually pitch a tent in you."
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   That the Holy Spirit is in you.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   So let me wrap this up, what Jesus is saying.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   What Jesus is saying is he came and he dwelt among us, among us,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   so that he can prepare us so that the Holy Spirit can dwell in us.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Do you get that?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   In Mark 2, verse 21, Jesus tells the disciples, right?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   He tells the tax collectors and he's telling the story about, you know,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   about the Holy Spirit and he says, "No one puts new wine into old wineskin."
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   If you put new wine into old wineskin, what happens to the old wineskin?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   It bursts.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   So in order for you to put the new wine into the bag,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   you need to make sure that you need to have a new bag.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   So you put the new wine into the new wineskin.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   What is he talking about?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Is he talking about getting drunk?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Is it next time we have a wedding to make sure that the wineskin is new?
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   What is he saying?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   I believe what Jesus was saying in that text is related to what he's saying here.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   His whole purpose of why he went to the cross and he said,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   remember he said, "I'm going to the Father's house and prepare a house for you."
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   It is not that the heaven is not ready.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   He's preparing us to be in heaven.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Well, how is he going to do that?
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   He made us into new wineskin.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Do you understand that?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   By washing us with his blood, by forgiving us our sins, atoning for our sins,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   he made the old wineskin into new wineskin.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   He said, "Whoever is in Christ," what does he say?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   "The old has passed, behold the new has come."
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   He's talking about us.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Now why did we have to be made new?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   So that the new wine can come in.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   And what is the new wine he's referring to?
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   And that's exactly what happens after the resurrection in Acts chapter 2.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   The Holy Spirit comes and he doesn't pitch a tent among us.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   He makes it indwelling in us.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   And so now the Holy Spirit is in us.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   And that's why he says because he's indwelling in us,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   if you want to bear fruit, you're not going to be the one bearing the fruit.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   The Holy Spirit is going to be bearing fruit through you.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   So because Jesus is divine, and the Holy Spirit is coming,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   as he dwells in you, you must also dwell in him.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   So the key to our walk with God, the key to bearing fruit,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   is walking in the Spirit, praying in the Spirit,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   fellowshipping in the Spirit, studying in the Spirit.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   That our whole life is connected with the Spirit
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   because we cannot by our own strength.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   That's what he means.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   So that was probably the most difficult.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   If you didn't catch all of that,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   I strongly encourage you to go back and listen to that again.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Maybe I didn't do a good job connecting this,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   but this is key to our walk with God.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Because he says if you do not meno with him,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   you cannot bear fruit.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   And if you do not bear fruit, if there's no evidence of any fruit,
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   that means there is no connection with him.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   And if you don't have any connection with him, what does he say?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   It gets chopped down to be burned.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   In other words, you are probably not a Christian.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   So the key to our walk with God, key to our identity in God,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   is the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Second thing that he says, he says the helper is going to come,
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   but he says he will not leave you as orphans.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Now the word "orphan" itself, right?
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Do we call somebody who's 30 years old
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   and his mother and father passed away early,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   do we call them orphans?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Normally we don't.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   If they're grown-up adults, they say, "You were orphaned when you were young."
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   But we don't typically call somebody in their 30s, 40s, and 50s,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   you know, and I'm 52 years old, and say, "I'm orphaned because my parents died."
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   We don't usually use that for older people.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Usually when we say somebody's orphaned,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   it means that when they were young children, they were helpless.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   They needed parents to guide them, shelter them, and take care of them,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   and their parents, for whatever reason, wasn't there.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   So when he says, "I will not leave you as orphans,"
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   by him saying that, he's telling them that you are helpless,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   and I'm not going to leave you that way.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   So the Holy Spirit is coming, not to simply assist you,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   it's so that he may not leave you as orphans, as helpless.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   The word for the Holy Spirit here, parakletos,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   in our translation, it's translated "helper."
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   Again, this is another word that can't be translated with one single word.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   So if you look at your different translations,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   it'll say "helper," "counselor," "advocate," or "comforter."
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   The word literally means the one who's called to one side.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   In other words, if you're headed toward a path,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   somebody has given to you to stay with you the whole way.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   And that's how the Holy Spirit is described for us in the Bible,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   that he is a helper, a counselor, an advocate, a comforter,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   whatever it is that you need for you to continue this journey.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   The Holy Spirit is going to come, he's going to guide us and lead us.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Well, what does he guide us and lead us to? John 14, verse 26.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you."
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Now, I want you to really hone in on what he says here,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   because when we think of the Holy Spirit,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   a lot of people think of the Holy Spirit as some supernatural power
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   or some feeling that we get when we are in the middle of worship
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   or we're praying and there's some outside force that keeps coming in,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   touching us and then leaving us when we're done.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   That's not how the Bible describes the Holy Spirit.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   He said that the Holy Spirit, the helper, the counselor, the advocate, the comforter,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   he's going to stay with you the whole time.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   He doesn't come and go.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   There is no two baptisms of the Holy Spirit. There are no three baptisms.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   There is no Christian who doesn't have the Holy Spirit in them constantly.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   He said he's going to come, he's going to stay with you,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   and the primary thing that he's come to do is to remind you of the things that I have already said to you.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   In other words, he's going to take the Word of God,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   and he's going to make it effective in our lives.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   And you know that there's a huge difference between just studying the Bible
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   and being illuminated by the Bible,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   where the Word of God is being used to judge the thoughts and intentions of other people's hearts
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   versus the Word of God being, judging the thoughts and intentions of your heart.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   While you can hear the same gospel for years and years and years,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   and for whatever the reason, the Holy Spirit opens your eyes,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   and the same Word makes complete sense.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   And you repent, and you give your life to follow Christ.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   That's the difference between studying the Word of God
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   and having the Word of God illuminate you by the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And he says the Holy Spirit is going to come and do that.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   He says he's going to cause you to remember,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   to think about all the Word, the gospel that has been preached,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   and make it effective for you.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   John 16, verse 13, "But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own initiative,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   but whatever he hears, he will speak, and he will disclose to you what is to come."
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   So the role of the Holy Spirit, just like Jesus, he says,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   "I do not speak on my own accord. I say whatever the Father told me."
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   And then the Holy Spirit says the same thing.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   The Holy Spirit comes to remind us, and to make the Word of Christ effective in us.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   And so the primary way that the Holy Spirit comes alongside is through his Word.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   Through his Word.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   So without a clear hearing of his voice, you cannot be abiding in Christ.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   You cannot be abiding by the Holy Spirit. Let me say that again.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   Without a clear hearing of the voice of Christ,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   the work of the Holy Spirit automatically gets quenched.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Because that was the primary reason why the Holy Spirit was to come.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   To come alongside, to help, to counsel, to advocate, and to comfort us through his Word.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Romans 8.26, he says, "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses."
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   He helps our weaknesses in our comfort.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   He reminds us of the truth that we already know.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   I think many of you have gone through a lot of trials, even just the last couple of months.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Whether it's through a job, or sickness, or a loved one who you may have lost.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Some difficult things that are happening in your life.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   And how did the Holy Spirit come and comfort you?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   He reminded you of the truth that you already know.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   That our God is sovereign.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   That we're only here temporarily.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   That God hears our prayers. That he walks among us.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   And so the Holy Spirit comes and he comforts us in our weakness.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   For we do not know how to pray as we should.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   You know what's really interesting to me is,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Paul, through the Holy Spirit, tells us, "You're not going to be good at praying."
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Right?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   I mean, in some sense, it's weirdly encouraging.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Because most Christians will say their weakest part of their walk with God is prayer.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Now, this is not an excuse that we shouldn't pray.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   We are challenged, we are told to be devoted to prayer.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   But Paul himself says, "God knows that you're going to be struggling in prayer."
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   "That you're going to have a hard time knowing even what to pray for."
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   But the Spirit himself intercedes.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   In other words, him knowing our weakness has given us the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Because what you are not effective in doing, God will do through the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   Holy Spirit intercedes for us.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Not just with any prayer, but with groanings too deep for words.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   I think if you've lived long enough as a Christian,
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   you've probably groaned in your prayers before yourself.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   You don't have words to express, but it expresses your emotions and your thoughts.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   And you can't articulate with words, but it's like, "Oh my God. My God, my God."
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   He says that the prayers of the Holy Spirit are deep.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   It is weighty.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   Because it's groaning on behalf of our weakness.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   He said, "We're not going to succeed. We're not going to bear fruit."
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   "Because we're trying harder. We're more disciplined."
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   "Or we're better. We're more moral."
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   "Or we're better educated."
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   "Or we had the proper training."
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   He said, "No, you're going to bear fruit because the Holy Spirit has been deposited in you."
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   "So that you may bear fruit as He dwells in you, that you continue to dwell with Him."
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   And thirdly, He says, "This Holy Spirit, not only does He come to help."
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   "Not only does He not leave us as orphans and helps us in our weakness."
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   He says, "This is forever."
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Jesus came physically for a period of time.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   For 33 years, for 3 years in ministry.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   And then He did many miracles, but then He had to physically go.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   So physically, He's up in heaven, sitting at the right hand of the Father.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   But He said, "When the Holy Spirit comes, this helper," He says, "is going to be forever."
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Ephesians 1, 13-14, "In Him you also, after listening to the message of the truth, the gospel of your salvation."
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   "Having also believed, you were sealed."
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   In other words, you are marked to be genuine believers.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   "In Him, with the Holy Spirit of promise."
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   In other words, the distinguishing mark between a Christian and non-Christian is the Holy Spirit.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   Has the Holy Spirit opened your eyes?
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   Is there an indwelling of the Holy Spirit?
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Is there evidence of the fruit of the Spirit in your life?
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   Who is given as a pledge.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Some of your translations, the word "pledge" is "deposit."
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   And I don't know if people still do that today.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   If you go into a store and you see, I don't know, you see an iPhone.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   I don't know what you would buy at a store.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   Pants, you know what I mean?
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   I don't know.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   A long time ago when I would go to a store and I couldn't afford the pants, I would put $5 deposit.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Because I don't want that pants being sold.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   Because, as you can see, I don't have a normal body.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   So it's very difficult to find pants that fit.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   So if I find one, I need to make sure that I put a deposit.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   That nobody else, like me, which probably doesn't exist, but if he does come, they're going to want that pants.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   So I would put the deposit down, and then even if I come and put $5 every week, at some point I'm going to pick up the pants.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   That's how they used to do it.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   I don't know if they still do that today.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   No, it doesn't exist.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   It's only for the people that are older.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   But that's what deposit means.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Deposit is guaranteeing that the person who put the deposit, from that moment on, even though it is not complete,
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   they didn't pick it up yet, that they have every intention to pick it up.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   And when the time comes, they're going to come and pick it up.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   And no one else can claim that for themselves.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   Well, the Bible says that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as a pledge, as a deposit.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   For what purpose?
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   As an assurance of our redemption.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   He didn't just leave it up to us.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   You figure it out.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   I've given you all the things that you need.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   I gave you the church.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   I gave you leaders.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   I gave you spiritual gifts.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   And I'm going to leave you, and I'm going to wait on the other side, hope you make it.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   That's not what he did.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   Because he knew we couldn't make it.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   He knew that we were going to have a hard time even praying.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   So the Holy Spirit is deposited in us as a pledge, guaranteeing that what he started, he will complete.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   That's why he said, Paul says, "He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion."
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   He doesn't say, "He who started a good work in you, hopefully you can finish the job."
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   He doesn't say that.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   What he started, he will continue to bring to completion.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Now, how does he do that?
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   He has the Holy Spirit deposited in us.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   So when he says, "I am the vine," he says, "As the Holy Spirit dwells in you, you must also dwell in him."
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   And this is forever.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   This is not just until we get to heaven.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Because if the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is just to get to heaven, it wouldn't be forever.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   It would be until I come.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   No, but he says, "The Holy Spirit will be indwelling forever."
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   Our union with Christ in his death and resurrection isn't just so that we can cross the bridge.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   And that's why he doesn't say that Christianity isn't simply about erasing the consequence of sin.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   The Bible describes us as new creatures.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   The old is gone.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   Whatever we were before, the Holy Spirit made an indwelling in us, is gone.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   We may have bad habits.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Because we still live in this flesh, we may have things that we remember of the past, a lot of habits that we still have.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   But at the core of who we are, the Holy Spirit completely changed us.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   We have been made into new wineskin.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   That's why people often ask, "Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden."
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   And oftentimes the heaven is described as a new heaven, new Garden of Eden.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   Well, Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden, so what guarantees us that when we get to heaven,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   that this is going to happen again and this whole cycle is going to begin again?
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   The answer is simple.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   The Holy Spirit is indwelling in us.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   So the state that we will be in eternity will be much better than Adam and Eve was from the beginning.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   So the recreation of what was lost at the fall is not only going to be recreated to what it was,
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   but it's going to be far above that.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   That we have become co-heirs with Christ.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   And that's what the Holy Spirit is.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   The Holy Spirit has made an indwelling in us.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   And so therefore we are called to continue with him.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Does that make sense?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   I mean, this is heavy.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   I mean, it's really heavy.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   So if any of you fell asleep for five minutes, even at home, I know your couch is really comfortable.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   All the messages, all the "I am" statements are crucial.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   But I encourage you, if any part of this went over your head, go back and listen to it again.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   And then if my English isn't good enough, then go to the commentaries and read it for yourselves.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   This is that important.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   Jesus leaving, Holy Spirit coming, indwelling, that he is going to help us, he's going to stay with us,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   he's not going to leave us as orphans, and this is going to be eternal, is at the core of who we are.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   And he says, until you do that, until you understand that, you cannot bear fruit.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   Until the fig tree who has dried up and cursed, God completely transforms us into a peach tree,
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   you will not bear peach fruit.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   Right?
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   So let me stop a minute right here.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   There's a lot of people who are in the church who came in and never really met Christ.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   Never really met Christ.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   So you've heard the talk of the Holy Spirit, you're doing Bible study,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   and maybe you might even be leading things.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   But the only experience that you have in your walk with God is frustration.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Because you have all these standards that have been set for you, that Jesus is holy, so we ought to be holy.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   God is holy, the temple is holy, we ought to strive for holiness, we need to love unconditionally.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   And so the more we hear the imperatives of what it means to be a Christian, it doesn't free you.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   It doesn't cause joy in your life.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   Because Christianity just sounds like a lot of rules.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   What you do enjoy is friendship, purpose, community.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   That when we die, I don't have to be afraid of death.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   So those things are very beneficial.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   But the actual walk with God is tremendously burdensome.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Because you may be a fig tree trying to bear peaches.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   So you naturally gravitate toward the world.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   But then you live physically in the church.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   And so you're constantly torn.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   So you understand it mentally, you understand it logically,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   you regurgitate information that you have heard, especially if you've been at a church for a long time.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   You know all the systematic theology.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   But you never understood when Jesus said, "I have come to give life, and give this life abundantly."
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   What does that mean?
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   What does that mean?
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   "My sheep will hear my voice, and they will follow me."
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   See, the danger of living in a post-Christian culture is that a lot of non-Christians who have many Christian friends
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   are peer-pressured to act like Christians.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   And they've never met the Lord.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Jesus says, "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in Him."
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   Remain with Him. Dwell with Him. Continue with Him.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Do you know this Lord?
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   I'm not talking about some charismatic experience where you have some overwhelming experience
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   or emotions that overwhelm, you can't help but uncontrollably cry.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   But do you understand what it means to have life?
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   To have this life abundantly?
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   Again, I'm not going to be able to finish this sermon this morning
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   because I don't want to go longer than I should, especially online.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   But when we abide in Christ, He says, again for the last part,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   I'm going to revisit the second part and we're going to skip to the last part.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   When we abide in Christ and we bear fruit, He says four things happen.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   In verse 8, it glorifies God.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   This is the way we give glory to God.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   It's not coming to church and raising your hands and just doing the right things.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   No, when we abide in Christ and that causes us to bear much fruit,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   He said fruit is what brings glory to God.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   A Christian who is constantly living in this cycle of sin
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   and never really understanding what it means to bear fruit
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   and never really reproducing, and therefore God is not glorified.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   No matter how much we try to glorify God,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   it's kind of like pushing a dead car that doesn't have gasoline.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   It's just dead weight that you have to push, but you're not going anywhere.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Until we abide in Christ, you cannot bear fruit.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   And when we bear fruit, it brings glory to God.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Verse 8, it says, and it proves that we are His disciples.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Assurance of salvation isn't simply somebody telling you, "Don't doubt, don't doubt."
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   We live in a generation where doubting for any reason is unhealthy, it's not good.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Don't ever doubt. Don't ever question your faith.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   When the Bible is filled with, examine yourself.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   Is your faith genuine?
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   What you see in Scripture of what a genuine believer looks like and what he bears fruit,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   does that look like you? Is that you?
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   And I'm not talking about some external standard of like, "Am I doing this and am I doing that?"
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   Just at the core of it, do you know this Christ?
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   Have you met this Christ?
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Have you truly seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   In the end, he says, when God is glorified,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   because we bear fruit and we abide in Christ,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   it will give us assurance of who we are, that we're His disciples.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   In verse 9 and 10, it says, "Then we abide in His love."
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   Then His love, that we have assurance of this love.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   It's confirmed.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   That it's not just wishful thinking.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   It's not just some empty words that are given to people because they're having a hard time in life.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   God loves you unconditionally.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   And the love of God is spread so generously to everybody without context.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   And so you have Christians and non-Christians who are absolutely assured,
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   "God loves me unconditionally, so God is not calling me to repent of sins."
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   Because He loves me unconditionally.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   He says, "No, when we are bearing fruit, when we are abiding in Christ,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   when God is glorified and that we are His disciples, that that is confirmed,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   then He says His love is assured.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Then we abide in His love and His love abides in us."
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   And then in verse 11, He says, "Finally, the reason why He says all of this
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   is not to bring a burden upon the church,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   He says, "so that my joy may be in you and that the joy may be full in you,"
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   is ultimately bring joy.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   So for a true believer who has met Christ, righteousness is a joy.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   Holiness produces joy.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Pursuit of Christ we pursue not simply because it's our duty,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   but that's where we find life.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   Abiding in Christ is where we drink the living water.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Abiding in Christ is where we eat the bread,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   that we do not thirst and we are no longer hungry.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   And so the challenge for us as we look at this, and again, as I said,
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   what Jesus says here is the key to Christian life.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   Am I genuinely abiding in Christ? Is God glorified?
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   Do I have assurance? Do I have confidence in His love?
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   And am I living this abundant life that He promised?
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   Or do I find life somewhere else, and then when I come to church, I find duty?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   And the answer is, again, we don't know exactly when the church is going to open up.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   It may be a few weeks. Hopefully it won't be more than that.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   But this divine appointed time that God has given us to be home and take some time to reflect,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   and that when we come back together physically as a church,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   that we do not just come back and just go through the motions.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   That we don't just do what we normally did in the past,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   that we worship again because that's what we did before.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   We're going to be joining small groups and studying inductive bibles because that's what we did before.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   That we would examine ourselves so that when we come to church,
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   that we would truly build a church that will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   That the fruit that we bear is not just harder work,
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   just simply because we just figured out how to do this better,
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   but because we are genuinely abiding in Christ.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   So let me pray for us.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   And again, just to kind of remind you, there's going to be a sign up after maybe within an hour or so.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   So please go there as soon as you can so that we can know which services are full,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   and we can kind of direct that hopefully by the end of this week.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   Okay, let me pray for us.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   What a gracious and loving God you are.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   I pray, Father, that the word that you have revealed to us
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   would judge the thoughts and intentions of our own heart.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Lord, is our hope on temporal things.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Is our joy founded on things, Lord God, that will come and disappear.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   Help us, Lord God, to firmly plant our feet and to be rooted
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   in the only source that we know of and that we believe can truly bring life.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   So we ask, Lord God, that what you have ordained will come to fruition.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   Help us, Lord, to be truly abiding in Christ, that we may glorify our Father,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   that we may have assurance of who we are,
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   that we may have confidence to abide in your love,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   and that our joy truly may be made full in you.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   [music]
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   There is no more for heaven now to give.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   my steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   for my life is wholly bound to His.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   Oh, how strange and divine I can sing,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   all is mine, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   [music]
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   The night is dark, but I am not forsaken,
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   for by my side the Savior He will stay.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   I labor on in weakness and rejoicing,
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   for in my need His power is displayed.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me,
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   through the deepest valley He will lead.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   [music]
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   Though fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   The future's sure, the price it has been paid,
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   for Jesus bled and suffered for my body,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   and He was raised to overthrow the grave.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   To this I hold, my sin has been defeated,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   Oh, the chains are released, I can sing,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   I am free, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   [music]
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   With every breath I long to follow Jesus,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   for He has said that He will bring me home.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   And day by day I know He will renew me,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   until I stand with joy before the throne.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   Oh, the glory evermore to lose,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   when the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   Oh, the glory evermore to lose,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   when the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat,
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   Let's pray.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   Lord, we want to lift up the leaders of our country.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   President Trump, the doctors that surround him,
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   Vice President Pence.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   We pray for our governor, Governor Newsom.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   We pray for our mayors.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   We pray for the local leaders, Lord God,
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   that you would give them wisdom.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   Lord, I know what a hard decision,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   difficult decision it must be.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   But I pray, Father, you would help them to put politics aside
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   and that they would have the best interests, Lord God,
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   of the people that they govern in mind
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   when they make decisions.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   Whatever the consequence that it may be,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   help them, Lord God, to filter through
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   whatever concerns and fears and loyalties that they may have
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   that is to their own parties or human interest.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   Help them, Lord God,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   to be able to see the needs of the people
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   and to be able to make the right decisions.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   And so we pray for special grace, Lord God,
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   and as you told us, Lord God, that there is no governing authority
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   that is not under your authority.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   So help us, Lord, to continue to pray
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   and to do as much as we can to support them.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   We pray again, Father God, for the local church leaders.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   What does it mean, Lord God, to be faithful in this context?
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   How do we run the church?
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   How do we make decisions in a way, Father God, that puts you first?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   Help us, Lord, whatever we do, that we would not be in fear,
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   but in complete faith and confidence, Lord,
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   that we are honoring you with the word.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   So help us, Lord, not to be like the rest of the world
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   who may be living in fear.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   Know, Father God, that the fear of death
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   has been abolished through Christ,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   that we have our eternity secure in the love of Christ.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   And so we ask, especially in the next few weeks and possibly months,
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   that the church would come out thriving, Father God,
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   that we would not be entangled with worldly affairs,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   that you would lift our eyes to see
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   that you have a greater purpose in the midst of all of this.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   Help us, Lord God, to see those who are lost,
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   those who are in need in prayer,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   those who are hurt, those who are isolated,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   those who are living in fear,
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   that the love of Christ would penetrate
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   into the deepest of the darkness that Satan creates,
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   that the gates of Hades would not prevail against it,
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   so that the church would come back even stronger,
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   more focused, more in love,
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   more determined, Lord God, to continue to abide in Christ,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   that our singing, our fellowship, our study, our evangelism,
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   all of it, Lord God, may be saturated by your presence in all things.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   So we pray for our members, we pray for our guests,
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   that whatever it is that you call us to do this week,
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   may it truly be done for your glory.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   and eternal love and power of God our Father
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   rest and equip and strengthen the church forevermore. Amen.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   [music]
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   [music]
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   Thank God in Jesus
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   He came to love
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000]   He'll end for you
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   He lived and died
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   To buy my soul
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   My Savior lives
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000]   Because He lives
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   I can face tomorrow
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   Because He lives
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000]   All fear is gone
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   Because I know
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   He holds the future
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   And life is worth the living
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   Just because He lives
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   Oh, that's why
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   My heart is filled with a thousand songs
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   Proclaiming the glories of Calvary
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   With every breath, Lord, how I long
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000]   To sing of Jesus who died for me
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   Lord, take me deeper into the glories of Calvary
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   [music]
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   Sin is my eternal joy
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   I hear the triumph of your wounds
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   By our Savior's crimson flow
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   Holy wrath has been removed
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   And your saints below
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   Join with your saints above
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   Rejoicing in the raise of life
