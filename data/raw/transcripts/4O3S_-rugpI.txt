[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:20.720]   - Good morning.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   Welcome to the Green Community Church.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   But again, before we get started,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   today was declared from the IMB, International Mission Board,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   as the day of prayer for the persecuted church.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   And so we don't have any slides or anything like that,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   but we'll probably post some stuff up for you today
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   and also throughout the week about what's going on
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   with the persecuted church around the world.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   And obviously, specifically, we've been engaged with ministry
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   that's going on in India, and we're praying for our pastors.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   Obviously, you know that Pastor Isaac passed away
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   because of COVID, and so I've been communicating
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   here and there with the pastors there.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   But it's obvious that they're pretty saddened by it
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   because he was the next spiritual leader
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   outside of Pastor Matthew, who started the ministry over there.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   And so if you guys can continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   And along with that, we are doing fundraisers for them,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   and so we have an announcement from Rachel about that,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   what's going on.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   I'm here to announce that our second annual service auction fundraiser
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   for the India pastors will officially start the bidding process today.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   We'll be posting a photo album in our Berean Community Church Facebook page,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   hopefully latest by 9.30 p.m. today, hopefully earlier.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   And once that's posted, bidding is officially open.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   You can bid on a service or item by commenting on the photo.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   More details on how to bid will be posted in the album description,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   or you can contact me with any questions.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   But basically, everything is the exact same process as last year.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   Please remember to keep this auction and the India pastors in your prayers,
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   for as you know, all this will be worthless without God's blessing and provision.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   I am excited for you to see just how talented and gifted our church members are.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   I'm really impressed and surprised by what people submit.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   We have over 100 submissions this year,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   so there's a lot of good writing talent.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   The auction starts today, and bidding will go until this Saturday, June 12th at 9.30.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   So we're going to send out a Zoom link this week,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   where we'll be online on June 12th for the last 30 to 45 minutes to hang out,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   banter, and watch the auction end live together.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   So hopefully you're looking forward to it, and thanks for your participation.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   Okay, thank you.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   Those of you guys who participated last year, you know exactly what's going on.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   So tonight isn't the auction.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   Tonight is they're going to post like what kind of services,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   and what kind of things have been donated.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   So you can go on there, and you can make a bid onto that.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   And then next Saturday is they're going to be doing the live bidding over Zoom.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   So this was an idea that Andy and Rachel had last year while we were in the pandemic,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   and it was such a great idea, and they just did it voluntarily.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   We had no idea how successful it would be.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   And so this would be, again, another opportunity to do that this year.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   And again, all the funds will be going to support our pastors who are out in India.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   So if you guys can participate in that.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   So you can start taking a look at it.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   If you don't have Facebook, you can borrow someone else's Facebook to go take a look
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   and just kind of scroll down because that's where it's going to be posted.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   And again, if you for whatever reason refuse to get on there, maybe can they download that?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   Okay, so you need to get Facebook basically, temporarily, fake account,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   whatever you need to do.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   That's basically what's going to happen.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   And then next Saturday is where the Zoom is going to happen,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   where the actual bidding is taking place.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   Okay?
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   All right, so a few things we want to announce before.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   Not next Sunday, but Sunday after is Father's Day.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   Just give you a heads up.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   So those of you -- usually Father's Day kind of sneaks up on us.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   But if you are a father or you're making an announcement that you're going to be a father
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   or you're going to bring a father to church who don't normally attend,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   please let us know ahead of time so that we can make the proper arrangements.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   So there is going to be a Father's Day lunch that's going to be taking place over there
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   on the cafe side.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   And I'm assuming that there will be pizza and stuff for the children as well for the moms.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   Right?
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   Okay?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   So that's in two Sundays.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   And then membership class, that's eight weeks long from 9 to 10.20 a.m. for eight.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   And it takes place at the youth group room on the other side, the cafe side.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   And, again, if you are interested in becoming a member of the church,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   please sign up with Pastor Nate, and that will be starting on July 4th.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   So it's a few weeks away from now, but the sign-ups are taking place right now.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   Okay?
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   Please contact Pastor Nate.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   And all of this stuff will be on Facebook or it will be on the church app,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   and you'll be able to find where you can sign up for that.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   VBS, live VBS, is taking place this year.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   Last year we tried to do it online, but this year it's going to be live.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   It's on July 19th through 23rd.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   The theme is, along with our church theme, Watch and Pray.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   And so the registration is open, and it's going to close on June 27th.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   And so if you are planning to bring your children
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   or bring some other children to participate in that on June 27th,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   obviously we have more facilities this year where you can kind of spread the kids out
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   and they're going to do what they can.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   So please register for that as soon as possible.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   And along with that, they need volunteers to help out.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   So even if it's just one day, whether it's decoration or skits or whatever it may be,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   they'll give you assignments on how to participate.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   And so if you want to sign up for that, Jane Shin is the one who is in charge.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   Again, you can go to the church app or the church Facebook page or the website,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   and they'll be able to give you information where you can sign up for that.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   Along with that, there's an evangelism outing that's going to be taking place on July 17th, 18th,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   and the main event taking place on July 24th.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   All of this in preparation for the cafe outreach night that's taking place.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   So if you want to sign up for that and help, again, the links will be available on the church app
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   and I believe also on the website as well.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   All right. We'll give you a minute to prepare for your offering online, digitally,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   and also a physical offering will be in the back as you are leaving if you need that.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   So let's pray, and we'll jump into the service today. All right, let's pray.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace. We thank you for the love that you pour upon us.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   Things that we are aware of, things, Lord, that sometimes slip by.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   That even this week, if our hearts have drifted away from you,
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   help us, Lord God, to be reminded of who you are.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   That all that we strive for, all that we desire and hope for,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   will be grounded in eternal things that you've given.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   We pray, Father God, that even the offering that we give may be given to you, Father God,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   joyfully, willfully, and may be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   [music]
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   [music]
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   [music]
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   [music]
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   [music]
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   [music]
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   [music]
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   [music]
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   Let us all rise as we sing these praises.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   [music]
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   [music]
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   Who breaks the power?
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   [music]
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   This is amazing grace.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   This is unfailing love.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   That you would take my place.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   That you would lay down your life.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   That I would be set free.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   [music]
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   Who brings our chaos?
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   Who brings our chaos back into order?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   [music]
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   Who rules the nations with truth and justice?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.720]   Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   The King of glory, the King above all kings.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   This is amazing grace.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   This is unfailing love.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   That you would take my place.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   That you would lay down your life.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   That I would be set free.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   [music]
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   Worthy is the King who conquered the grave.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   Worthy is the Lamb who was slain.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   Worthy, worthy, worthy.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   This is amazing grace.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   This is unfailing love.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   That you would take my place.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   That you would bear my cross.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   You would lay down your life.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   That I would be set free.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   Oh, Jesus, I sing for all that you've done for me.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   [music]
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   [music]
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   Sing grace and peace.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   Grace and peace.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Oh, how can this be?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:51.720]   We're lawbreakers and thieves for the worthless, the least.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   You have said that our judgment is death.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   For all eternity without hope, without rest.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   Oh, what an amazing mystery.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   What an amazing mystery that your grace has come to me.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   [music]
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   Grace and peace.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   Grace and peace.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   Oh, how can this be?
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   A matchless king of war paid the blood price for me.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   A slaughtered lamb, what atonement you bring.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   A mild-listener's heart can be cleansed, can be free.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   Oh, what an amazing mystery.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   What an amazing mystery that your grace has come to me.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   [music]
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Grace and peace.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   Grace and peace.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Oh, how can this be?
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   But songs of gratefulness never rise, never cease.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   Loved by God and called as a saint,
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   my heart is satisfied in the riches of Christ.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   Oh, what an amazing mystery.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   What an amazing mystery that your grace has come to me.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   [music]
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   Oh, what an amazing love.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Oh, what an amazing love I see.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   What an amazing love I see that your grace has come to me.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Oh, what an amazing love I see.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   What an amazing love I see that your grace has come to me.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   What an amazing love.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   Oh, what an amazing love I see.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   What an amazing love I see that your grace has come to me.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   Oh, what an amazing love I see.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   What an amazing love I see that your grace has come to me.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   [music]
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   You may be seated.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   verses 4 through 11.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   We're going to be going warp speed today.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   Okay, yeah, we're going to cover all the passages, all of it.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   4 through 11, okay?
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   So Hebrews chapter 12, verses 4 through 11.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   striving against sin, and you have forgotten the exhortation which is
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   addressed to you as sons.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   nor faint when you are reproved by him.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   and he scourges every son whom he receives.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   It is for discipline that you endure.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   God deals with you as with sons.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   But if you are without discipline,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   of which all have become partakers,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us,
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   and we respected them.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   but he disciplines us for our good so that we may share his holiness.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful,
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   yet to those who have been trained by it,
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   afterwards it yields a peaceful fruit of righteousness.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   Let's pray.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   Gracious Father, we pray for your grace.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   We pray that your word would convict us, guide us, sanctify us,
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   that we may see a greater glimpse of your glory,
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   that we may change, we may be sanctified,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   we may be able to persevere through all the ups and downs, Lord God,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   of living in this fallen world.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   Help us to be reminded, Lord, that we are aliens and strangers
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   just passing through, eagerly waiting and longing, Lord God,
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   for the second coming of Christ.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   We pray. Amen.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   I'm sure many of you have been watching the news
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   that there are UFOs in the world, okay,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   or at least there's more attention given, right?
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   There's been speculations and pictures and stuff that's been around
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   since we were kids, right, but recently with all the videos
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   and now especially the government fanning the flames
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   that they're not absolutely certain anymore whether they can deny it,
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   and so there's been a lot of speculations.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   Are aliens real, right?
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   And all this space exploration, you know, a lot of that is,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   is there life there?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   Are there water? Is there oxygen?
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   Are there enough things to sustain life?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   And so they've been studying this for many, many decades,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   but recently, obviously, it's come to the forefront,
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   and there's a lot of speculations and talking about it.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   I've heard a lot of Christians talking about it.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   What would it mean if there are actually aliens in this world?
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   What if there was irrefutable proof that that was actually the case?
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   How would that affect us?
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   I've heard some people say recently, some Christians say
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   that if aliens are real, that it would rock their faith.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   I'm not sure exactly what they meant by that,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   but the way that it came across was that they would probably question their faith
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   if that was true.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   And it made me think, how would it affect you?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   Is this simple evidence of a UFO enough for you to say,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   "You know what, everything that I believe was false"?
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   Is your faith so weak and tender that something as a speculation
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   of maybe possibly intelligence outside of Earth
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   is enough for you to walk away from your faith?
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   And if that's not the case, what would cause you to walk away from your faith?
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   Maybe it's a loved one who gets cancer and say, "You know what,
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   God took him too early."
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   Or maybe a child who got sick and they left the Earth too early.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   What if maybe your business went bankrupt?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   What if your marriage fell apart or you're having difficulty
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   or your child walks away?
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   What would cause you to walk away from your faith?
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   You don't think that your faith is strong enough to be able to endure that.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   Whatever it is that you think may happen that's going to cause you
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.720]   to question your faith is probably at that very place where you are
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   constantly being poked and attacked.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   Because the Bible says that we have an enemy, the devil,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   He's not devouring his own.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   He's not devouring the world.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   He's devouring people who follow Christ because his primary objective
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   is to be the anti-Christ.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   So anyone who exalts Christ, anyone who says they're a believer in Christ,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   is at that very place where you feel like that's your Achilles heel.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   That's where your weakness is, is probably the place where you are
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   constantly being poked.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   If it's finance, if it is relationship, circumstance, peace, reputation,
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   whatever it may be, that may be the area where you are constantly being poked.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   The book of Hebrews, the whole book is written to people who are just drifting.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   They didn't decide to walk away from their faith.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   They weren't in danger of apostasy because something happened.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   You know what? I deny Christ.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   They were simply neglecting their faith, and they were becoming tired.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   See, most people who walk away from their faith, it doesn't happen by choice,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   at least not clear choice.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   It's just they become fatigued, tired.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   They get caught up with life, just like the third soil,
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   concerns of paying bills, raising children, the difficulty in the trials
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   of getting a job, dealing with coworkers, and trying to save enough money
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   for retirement and raising children.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   All of these things, it just fatigues you.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   And then instead of paying attention, you just kind of allow things to happen.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   And the natural course, natural flow of life is going to take you away from Christ.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   Well, the text that we're looking at in verse 4 begins by saying,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   "You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin."
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Now, you can look at that and be challenged and say, "Yeah, you know,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   we need to strive harder."
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   If you have energy, and you already came into this room with some vitality,
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   saying like, "Yeah, I want to do this," and this may be an encouragement to you,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   for a lot of you to read this passage, it's like, "Wow, I'm already tired as it is."
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   And his encouragement to me is, "Well, you haven't shed blood yet.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   You haven't even shed blood yet.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   It's not time for you to quit."
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   Again, you have to remember that the whole point of the book of Hebrews is really this.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   The whole point of the book of Hebrews is to challenge people who are drifting away
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   from Christ that it's not time for you to quit,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   that you have no reason to quit, to continue to persevere.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   And the reasoning that he gives is because you haven't shed blood yet.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   In other words, you're not dead yet.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   That's what he means, shedding blood.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   Shedding blood isn't simply like, "Oh, you got cut."
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   Shedding blood is another way of saying you have breath, you have life.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   And the reason why you have breath, you have life, is because somebody else shed blood for you.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   And that was the point that he was trying to get at, right, the whole book of Hebrews.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   You have life because somebody else shed blood.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.720]   You still have life because he did it, so you have no reason to quit.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   Because he's already bought your eternal life by his own sacrifice.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   So therefore, his challenge is, no matter how fatigued, no matter how tired, how wearisome,
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   he says, "No Christian, if his faith is genuine, has a reason to quit."
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   I remember years ago when I was being discipled back in college,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   I was working probably about 20 hours a week.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   And I was a super senior, so I was taking 22 units to finish school.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   And then I was involved in ministry.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   I was a part-time youth pastor.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   And then I was heavily involved with the campus ministry,
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   so I was probably giving about three or four sermons a week.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   I was leading three small group Bible studies.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   I had a 20-hour a week job.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   And so I was just fatigued.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   And I was in this apartment training, and so I was probably getting about three to four hours a day.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   And I was just so dead tired.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   But we had a rule in that apartment that no matter what time you slept,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   you have to get up at 5 in the morning.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   And we'd have to go running and do quiet time together.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   And after about a month and a half of doing this, I was so tired.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   And I went to our trainer, and I remember asking him, like,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   "I don't know if I can keep doing this because I'm like --"
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   I would go to the library, and literally I would just fall asleep at the table,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   fall asleep eating, fall asleep.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   And then I remember every time I would go to him, his advice to me was,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   "Peter, expand your capacity."
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.720]   Now, in a typical setting, I would have been angry, right?
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   How much more can I stretch?
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   I don't have any free time. I have nothing.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   And he said, "But, Peter, everything you're doing is important.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   Expand your capacity."
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   The reason why I took that to heart was because who that was telling me.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   He had aging parents at that time.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   He had a full-time job.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   He was doing everything I was doing, and he was excellent,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   and he was running the apartment, and he was a youth pastor,
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   and he had aging parents, and he had a brother who was mentally challenged,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   so he was constantly going home to take care of his brother.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   And he did all of that excellently.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   And so if that advice came from anybody else, I would have said,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   "Who are you talking to?
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   I'm sleeping four hours, so you want me to sleep two hours?"
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   But I remember always coming out from that counseling challenged
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   because he was setting an example for me, and to this day, it's stuck with me.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   "Expand your capacity."
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   Christ looks at our circumstance, and the advice now, he says,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   "You haven't to the point of shedding blood.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   I shed blood for you to live.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   Now you continue to persevere."
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   Jeremiah 12:5, it says, "If you have run with footmen,
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   and they have tired you out, then how can you compete with horses?
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   If you fall down in a land of peace, how will you do in the thicket of the Jordan?"
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   In other words, God is fully in charge, and he's training us and building us up.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   The text that we're looking at this morning, verses 4 through 11,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   the word "discipline" is used repeatedly over and over.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   You need to persevere because God is the one who is in charge of this discipline.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   So when I say the word "discipline," some of you will have the idea of discipline
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   as punishment immediately.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   Maybe it's your upbringing.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   Maybe it's your background.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   Whenever we say "discipline," punishment.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   God's going to punish you.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   Some of you, when we use the word "discipline," maybe you like to work out.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   Discipline means making a schedule, getting up at 6 in the morning,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   going out to work out and not eating certain things and doing certain things,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   saving up money.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.720]   Maybe in your mind, that's the first thing that gets triggered, discipline.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   So discipline, the word, is being used in our English language in various ways.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.720]   So we don't want to project what we think discipline is, what this is saying.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   We want to make sure that we understand what he means by it,
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   because the word he uses really is a word that encompasses all of that.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   In fact, the word that is used is "pidea."
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   Pidea, the root word, is the word "pious," and pious is the Greek word for "child."
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   So when he uses the word "discipline" in this text,
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   he's not simply talking about punishment, although that is part of it.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   He's not only talking about training, although that's part of it.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   It's basically he's describing a relationship where God makes us his adopted children
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   and he becomes our Abba Father.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   Now in this relationship between son and father, that he's raising us up.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   And in raising us up, just like if you raise a child,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   there are times you have to discipline them for doing wrong.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   There are some times you need to discipline them
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   so that they may be properly trained to do what is right.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   But the word "discipline" is a broad term referring to that now that he has made us his children,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   so that we may live up to the calling that we have been given.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   He hasn't just adopted us and said, "You know what? Now you have life. Just go enjoy it."
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   You're free. You have Christian liberty. Just do whatever you want.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   Just like if you have children or if you adopted a child into your home,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   you don't just adopt them, make sure that's on legal paper,
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   and then you just kind of let them be.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Part of the adoption, the reason why they go through all that process
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   is they want to know that if you're going to be a good parent.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   They want to know if you have the means to take care of them.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   They want to know if you're psychologically, physically able to take care of them.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   That's why you have to get reference letters.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   Are you part of a good community? What kind of reputation do you have?
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   Because they want to know if you are a fit father or mother.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   And so this word that is being used here to talk about God's discipline
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.720]   is basically talking about God's parenting.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   How does God parent us?
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   And so it's in that context that this text describes,
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   and I put it in three parts.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   To understand the perspective of how God deals with us as his children,
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   three things. One, God's discipline is perfect.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   That's the first point that I want to make.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   The second thing that this text teaches us is that God's discipline
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   is proof of our sonship and his love for us.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   It's proof.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   Third, God's discipline is for our own training.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   For our own good. That's the exact words that is used here.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   For our training. So one, God's discipline is perfect.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   Second, God's discipline is proof of our sonship and his love for us.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Third, God's discipline is for our training.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   In this text, firstly it says God disciplines us perfectly.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   Verse 5, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   nor faint when you are reproved by him."
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   In other words, there's two ways that an individual can wrongly accept
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   or respond to God's discipline.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   One, to take it lightly.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   Kind of like, whatever happens, happens.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   This is an individual who really doesn't see sin as that horrible.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   I remember, I think this week, and I was listening to Piper,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   and John Piper made a very clear distinction between confession and repentance.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   Somebody who is constantly taking lightly their sin
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   is somebody who is in the habit of confessing but never repenting.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   The difference is, repentance basically means not only to acknowledge your sin,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   but to turn away from your sin.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   But somebody who is constantly confessing is an individual who feels guilty.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   And the only thing that he's concerned about is that he gets out of his guilt.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   It's like, oh, once saved, always saved. God forgives me.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   He loves me unconditionally. And then you confess it.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   And you get it off your chest, and then you cling to verses
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   where God's--your sins are forgiven, and then you move on,
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   and then this cycle repeats over and over again,
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   never repenting, always confessing.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   This is an individual who takes the Lord's discipline lightly.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   Think about this pandemic.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   The whole world was shut down.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.720]   And an individual who kind of looks at the circumstance and says,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   you know what, years later, you're going to tell your children or grandchildren
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   about how difficult it was because it was shut down for a year,
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   and you couldn't hang out with your friends to get boba when you wanted.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   So you look at it, and say, it was inconvenient.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   There's no deep thought into it. There's a why did God do this?
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   What opportunities are made? It's just inconvenienced.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   And so circumstances and trials and difficulties come into our lives,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   and you just kind of brush it off.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   I'm just going to move on. What's the big deal?
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   He says, do not take the Lord's discipline lightly,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   meaning the Lord has a purpose for this.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   There's a purpose. There's something for us to learn.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.720]   There's a reason behind it, and that's why he says, do not take it lightly.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   The other end of that, he says, do not faint.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   Discouraged to the point where you don't want to do this anymore.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   How many people have you met, but because they were discouraged,
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   at this point, and somebody let them down, and said,
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   I love God, but I don't love the church.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   They become faint.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   And the reason why they become faint is because they don't see God's hand in it.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   Or if they see God's hand in it, they don't believe in a loving God.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   So therefore, they become faint.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.720]   One of the most common questions that I get from people,
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   especially if you've been alive for a while,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   is like, how do I trust people when they've wronged me in the past?
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   I've had this, and I've heard some horrible things that have happened to people
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   way before they've come to church.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   And the wrestling mass is, I don't know how I can ever trust anybody
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   considering what they've done to me.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   Here's the good news and bad news.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   The bad news is, you can't just turn that off.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   It would be insensitive for me to say, hey, suck it up and move on, right,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   I mean, considering the horrible things that have happened.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   The good news is, God didn't call us to trust them.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   God called us to love them.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   God didn't call us to trust them.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   God called us to love them.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   It doesn't require trust for us to love.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   See, when we become faint, part of that reason is because we don't see a sovereign God
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   who loves us, who've allowed this situation to happen.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   You know, as parents, that's our constant fear, right?
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   Did we do too much?
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   Did we not do enough?
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   So when we're disciplining our children, you know, years back we look at it and say,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   oh, maybe I should have been more patient with them.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.720]   Or maybe in that particular situation I should have been more harsh with them,
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   that I should have squeezed harder, or maybe I shouldn't have squeezed so hard
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   because our constant fear is that if we squeeze too hard, we're going to discourage them,
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   and they're going to lose heart.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   But if we don't discipline them enough, they're going to get spoiled,
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   and they don't think this is important.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   So there's a constant balancing act that parents do to make sure that we're doing what is necessary.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   Well, our God does not have that problem because God is all-knowing.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   He knows our heart.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   He is all-knowing, and he is all good.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   So therefore, even though we can't connect the dots, the Bible says that our God disciplines us perfectly.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   That's why we don't take it lightly, nor do we faint,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   because whatever it is that God has placed us in, he's doing it in his perfect knowledge,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   in his perfect love, in his perfect will.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   In Psalm 42, 5-6, it says, "Why are you in despair, O my soul?
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   And why have you become disturbed within me?
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   Hope in God, for I shall again praise him for the help of his presence."
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   Oh, oh my God, my soul is in despair within me.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   "Therefore, I remember you from the land of the Jordan and the peaks of Hermon from Mount Mizar."
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   Today, we're going to be participating in the communion.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   All of you guys have this communion wafer and thingy that we have,
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   and hopefully we don't have to do this for long.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   But the reason why God gave us this communion is for this reason,
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   because he knows that you and I have a tendency to look at circumstances through our physical eyes.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   That all that we have, we walk by what we see, not by faith, because that's our natural tendency.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   So the communion is given to the church to constantly remind us to look to him.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   That do you believe in a God who loved you enough to send his only begotten son?
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   How will he not, along with him?
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   If he gave his only begotten son, along with him, give us all things.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   If he gave us his only begotten son, why would he withhold any good thing from us?
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   And that's what the communion table really is, is to recalibrate our thoughts, our focus.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   So that in the midst of trials, in the midst of raising children and busyness of life,
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   that we would look to Christ, that we would look to God, who is completely sovereign and completely loving.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   In 1 Corinthians 10.13, it says, "No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   And God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able,
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   but with the temptation will provide the way of escape, so that you will be able to endure it."
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   That no matter what circumstance that you're in, past, present, or future, God is completely sovereign.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.720]   You remember the story of Job?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   His whole suffering was initiated because Satan challenged God and said,
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   "Your child that you say is righteous is only righteous because you've been protecting him.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   Let me at him. Take away your hedge of protection and see if he praises you after I'm done."
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   That's the beginning of the book of Job.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:23.720]   So all of his suffering was initiated by Satan saying, "Let me at him. Stop protecting him.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   Let me go at him." And God says, "Okay."
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   And then you see the cycle of pain and suffering.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.720]   Anything that you can possibly think of. Financial hardship, losing his children,
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   personal health goes out, his reputation of righteousness being challenged,
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   his closest friends coming and saying, "You must have done something wrong."
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.720]   There's no part of his life where he's not touched.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Any one of those things would cause an average man to crumble.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   Every part of his life, his reputation, his family life, health, wealth, everything,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   most things that people would fear, all of that happens to him in his life.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   And yet Satan's name is never mentioned after the beginning.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   All of it is, "God is doing this to you."
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   Why is God doing this to you?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   Even at the end, God doesn't show up and say, "It wasn't me. I didn't do that. Satan did it.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   Don't blame me." No. God takes ownership.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   Because that only happened because God allowed it to happen.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   Same thing happens in the New Covenant.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   Before Jesus goes to the cross, remember what Jesus says?
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   "Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat."
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   He has permission. He didn't gather up an army to challenge God. He has permission.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.720]   Even satanic work was under God's sovereign plan.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   And he allowed it to happen.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   So when he says, "No temptation has seized you, but what is common to man, but God is faithful,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able."
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:13.720]   In other words, that even in your trials and temptations, God has us in his arms.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   And what God does, he does perfectly.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   And therefore, that's why he says, "You have no reason to quit."
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   Because you're not the one fighting alone.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   Everything that he does, no matter what circumstance, no matter what has happened to you in the past,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   no matter how horrible that memory is, no matter how hard of a time we have connecting the dots,
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   God was sovereign.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   No matter what circumstance you are in now, no matter what hardship and struggle,
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   no matter what relational problems and hurt and pain that you hold on to today,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   God is sovereign.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   And no matter what you may face, your greatest fear may happen tomorrow,
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.720]   the answer is, God is sovereign.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   The God who is perfectly sovereign, perfectly knowing,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   who loves us like his own child, he is completely sovereign.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   And that's why he says not to take it lightly.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   Don't brush it off like, "Yeah, that's not going to bother me."
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   Or don't become faint.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   Because whatever God is doing, he does perfectly.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.720]   That's number one, to understand that God's discipline is perfect.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   Two, God's discipline is proof of sonship and love.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   He says in verse 7, "It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with sons.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   then you are illegitimate children and not sons."
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   So if you say you're a follower of Christ and you have no hardship in life,
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   he says maybe you're illegitimate.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   If God genuinely loves you, hardship will come.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   He said, "If you follow me, they hated me, so they're going to hate you."
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   If there's any reflection of myself in you, the world is not going to be happy with you.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   I mean, the problem that we have in our generation is we want to be cool
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   in the kingdom and in the world at the same time.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.720]   And we want to attract the world so that they can come into the church
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:30.720]   and have a smooth transition from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   And somehow people have convinced themselves that this is possible.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   That you've gotten accustomed to darkness and somehow you're going to come into light
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   and there's going to be no shock whatsoever.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   There's going to be a smooth transition.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   There's going to be no difference between a non-Christian sitting here in the Word of God
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.720]   and a Christian here in the Word of God.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   So we need to make it as dim as possible.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   We can barely see.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.720]   And so people whose eyes haven't adjusted to the light can also feel comfortable here.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.720]   He said, "If there is no discipline, that may be evidence that you're illegitimate children."
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   He said, "Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time?"
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   In other words, it was common grace given to us temporarily as seemed what was best to them.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   In other words, they're sinners too.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   They did what they thought was best, but they're sinners.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   So therefore, whatever discipline we receive, even though it was for our own good, was never perfect.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   But he disciplines us for good so that we may share his holiness.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:54.720]   Discipline for God's children is evidence of our sonship, is evidence ultimately of his love.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.720]   You know, we think that maybe the opposite of love is hatred.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   And you can make an argument for that.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   You could make an argument, make a point of that.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:12.720]   But when we disobey to love, it's usually not hatred.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.720]   When God says to love, "And the world will know that you are disciples of mine if you love as I have loved you," as Jesus said,
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.720]   then the world will know you are my disciples.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   And then we choose to reject that.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.720]   We don't go out hating the world.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.720]   "I hate you. I'm not going to obey Jesus, so I hate the world."
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   That's not usually how it's expressed.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   When we disobey love, usually we disobey with indifference.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   Indifference.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   Because getting dirty is uncomfortable with us.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   I have enough problems. I don't want to stress over your problems.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   So typically, it's indifference.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   I remember years ago, I had a pastor friend who came and told me,
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   "You know, I think the biggest problem in our generation in churches today is that we don't practice church discipline.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.720]   And so we allow sin to be rampant and do whatever they want,
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   and that's our biggest problem, so we need to bring church discipline back."
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   I agreed and disagreed.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   I agreed that sin should be taken seriously.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.720]   I agreed.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   Because the Bible clearly teaches us to practice church discipline.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   But the reason behind that is not what you think.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   The reason why the church generally does not practice church discipline is because of lack of love.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   Because if the people who are going astray was your brother or sister, father or mother, or daughter or son,
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   you would not stay silent because you love them.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   Even if they resent you for a period, you are more concerned about the harm that they are doing to themselves
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   than what they may say to you, because your love will supersede whatever discomfort that you may feel.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   Part of the reason why we are cautious and we stay away is really because we're indifferent.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   Don't be confused with practicing grace. That's not grace.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   Allowing a child who's running toward harm and saying nothing isn't grace.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   That's not loving. That's not being gentle.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   You're saying, "I believe you're going to crash and burn. I'm just going to let you be because I'm loving."
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   No. That's indifference. That's the opposite of love.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   Part of the reason why sin is not taken seriously, why we don't confront each other in truth, in love,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   is because we are not practicing the biblical love that he preaches.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   God did not leave us alone in our sins. He engaged us. He continues to engage us.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   Think about the nation of Israel.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   Think about the nation of Israel and we say, you know, you read the Old Testament and God seems so harsh.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   He's constantly sending prophets, telling Hosea to marry Gomer, a prostitute.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   Why would you do that? Just to tell them this is how hideous your sin is.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   And you read the Old Testament and say, "Oh, God is a God of judgment."
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   In the Old Testament, we come to the New Testament, it says, "God so loved the world that He only begotten Son."
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   He demonstrated His own love while we were yet sinners. He died for us.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   So the God of the New Testament seems like a loving God.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   God of the Old Testament seems like He's a judgmental, vengeful God.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   But the only reason why He's sending these prophets to warn them is because He loves them.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   If He was done with them, we wouldn't have the Old Testament.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   There wouldn't be this drama of sending His prophets and warning them to turn from their sins.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   Because all He had to do was, "Go. I'm done with you. I'm done."
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.720]   What would it take for Him to wipe out the earth?
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   I mean, it says in six days He created the earth.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   I'm sure destroying is a lot easier than creating. Right?
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   Building takes time. Destroying could, one day, you can bring those buildings down in one day.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   Boom! It's gone.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   The only reason why He sends His prophets to warn them, to discipline them,
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   and why He perseveres with them is because He still loves them.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.720]   He says discipline is a proof of His love.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   Same thing in the Old Testament. I mentioned that in the book of Revelation.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   Why this whole drama at the end with seven judgments?
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.720]   The seal judgment, trumpet judgment, the bowl judgment. Why all of this judgment?
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   Because God is pleading with the sinful world before judgment comes to turn and to repent.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   So He says, "If you are truly His children, He will discipline you."
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   God's discipline is proof of sonship and His love toward us.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:17.720]   Third and finally, God's discipline is for our training. It's for our own good.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:22.720]   Discipline is hard to take when we don't understand what it is.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   Discipline is hard to take when we don't understand what it's for.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.720]   I can remember probably the most pain that I've ever experienced,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   a physical pain, was at the hospital.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   I've broken my ankles, my arms, and there's an immediate pain that comes, but like prolonged pain.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:52.720]   I remember, I think I was about eighth grade, and our family never went to the dentist. Like ever.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   We're immigrant families. We didn't have insurance, so everything cost so much money.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   My teeth, if you look at my third grade picture, there's more cavities than I had regular teeth.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   So I went and basically I had like 20 some cavities that I needed to work on.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   I remember listening very carefully to my mom trying to get a discount.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   And even as an eighth grader, it's like, "Please don't get the discount. I need the full work."
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   You know what I mean? I don't want discount teeth work.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   And I remember that I just dread. It was like four Saturdays or something that we're going,
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.720]   and each time I went, it was excruciatingly painful.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   And I don't know if the Novocaine or whatever they were putting in my mouth just wasn't working,
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.720]   especially my front teeth.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.720]   I remember they were drilling inside of it for 30, 40 minutes, and I felt like I felt every single bit of that.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:50.720]   And I was pinching my thigh just to take away from this pain that maybe this pain will distract from this pain.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   But I endured through that. I didn't jump out of the seat and say, "What are you doing?"
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   Because I knew it was for my own good. I had to fix my teeth.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:06.720]   But when you don't understand what the pain is for, you don't understand who is doing it and why it's happening,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   it is very difficult to endure.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.720]   Pain just becomes pain.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   But what he's trying to say is that a God who practices perfect discipline,
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   and he's doing it because he loves us, has a specific purpose for our own good, for our own training.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   And that's why he's saying no matter how hard things get, he's telling the Hebrews,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   that you're drifting away because all you're seeing is the difficulty,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   not recognizing who it is that is allowing this to happen.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.720]   And that's why he's saying to fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:48.720]   He's in control of this. Satan is not roaming around outside of his care.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:53.720]   So whatever pain that you may have experienced in the past, present, or even in the future,
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   God who doesn't make mistakes, who loves us to the point that he would send his only begotten Son for us,
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   has a purpose to equip us and to train us.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   James chapter 1, 2-4, consider joy. Consider it all joy.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.720]   My brethren, when you encounter various trials, consider it pure joy.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.720]   You know, some people look at this passage and think that if you're a good Christian,
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.720]   that you should always have a smile on your face.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   Even in the midst of excruciatingly painful things that happen in life,
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:30.720]   because you want people to know, "Ah, nothing bothers me."
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   And you got this fake smile, fake, you know.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   He's not saying like, "Act silly." It's like, "Oh, I'm a good Christian. I love Jesus."
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   Even Jesus, as he was facing the cross, was agonizing before God.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   Is there another way? Because that's a natural human response.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   That's why he says in verse 11, "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful."
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:57.720]   So the fact that it is hard, the fact that it is not pleasant, is natural.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   But when he says, "Consider it joy," he's saying, "Think, consider, and calculate."
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   When you're putting it in your ledger between positive and negative,
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   when you look at it from the perspective of eternality,
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   within the hands of a sovereign God who loves us, who doesn't make mistakes,
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   consider it, think of it, pure joy.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   When you encounter trials of various kinds, knowing that you're testing of your faith,
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   produces endurance. Endurance.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   He said that's the point that he's trying to get us to.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   To endure, to persevere, to not quit. That's what endurance means.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   Our natural instinct is, when hardship comes, is to get rid of that hardship.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   Avoid the circumstance. If it's coming from people, avoid those people.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:51.720]   If it's whatever it is happening, I don't like it there. It's uncomfortable.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.720]   And so I'm going to change.
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   So we keep people at bay. We can switch churches. Change friends.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   Whatever it is, our natural instinct is, when we're uncomfortable, to change.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Because we don't want to be there.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   But he says, when the testing of your faith comes, in order to produce endurance,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   and when endurance happens perfectly, when you continue to endure,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.720]   this is not saying that there is no good time to ever change anything.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   There's times when false doctrines are being taught.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   When there's apostasy happening. There are times when we need to cut ties.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   Our unity is in unity with Christ.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   But he's saying this, if our natural instinct is, every difficult circumstance,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   our immediate thought is, God doesn't want me to be uncomfortable,
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   and so I need to change this. Change this relationship. Change this and that.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   He says, no. He said, consider pure joy, because it produces endurance,
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   and when you continue on the right path, you will have perfect results,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   so that you may be perfect, complete, lacking in nothing.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   Perfect meaning, God's intended purpose of your suffering.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   That if you continue, that's why an individual who is constantly switching
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   from one uncomfortable situation, until you get to another comfortable situation,
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   until that becomes uncomfortable, and then you go somewhere else,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   and then that becomes uncomfortable, he said, you never produce the result that God desires.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   Because what God desires requires perseverance.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.720]   Just like raising a child. You don't snap a finger and read them a bedtime story
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   of the rules that you're supposed to follow, and your parenting is done.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   It requires years. Those of you who are potty training your children.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   Did you just tell them, show them a picture, and show them a video, and then walk away?
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   No. You have to persevere. Right?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   Seemed like they got it right, and then the next thing you wake up in the morning,
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   you see a puddle of pee on the ground, and it's like, oh my gosh.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.720]   But you didn't quit on them. Right?
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   It required, even something simple as potty training, required perseverance.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   So if God is raising us as children, maybe some of us are being potty trained right now.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   Spiritual potty training, because you keep peeing everywhere. Maybe.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   Maybe some of you really smell.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.720]   He says you need to persevere in the right direction, because God is raising us up.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   He says to consider purity because God's perfect loving hand is trying to teach you something,
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.720]   and when you persevere in it, you will be complete lacking in nothing.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   In Romans chapter 5, 3-5. And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations,
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   knowing that the tribulation brings about what? Perseverance.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   Again, what is the primary thing that he says that happens when tribulation comes?
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   You learn to persevere. Persevere. Go through trials and endure through suffering.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.720]   Because when you endure through suffering, you have proven character.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.720]   Now, especially for the younger people in our generation,
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   we have a tendency to think that character comes from being famous on TikTok.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   Or your character comes from being successful at something, or getting a lot of attention.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   Character is not something that you get from reading a book.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   Character is not something you get because you're successful in business.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Character is not something you get because you made a few right decisions.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   He says character comes from perseverance. Doing hard things and enduring through it.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   That's what he says. He says when you have proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   Because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts, though the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:59.720]   Trials causes us to persevere, which develops character, and character is what we have hope in.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   Character basically is proven faith.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   We've been trained to look to Christ and not to the world.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.720]   We've been trained to run to Christ and our comfort come from Him and not to the world.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   Not to any worldly means. That's how the Bible describes character.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   So in everything that we do in life, we have some kind of training.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.720]   Like I said, if you're a child, you're potty trained.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.720]   Like pastors, we go to seminary and we get trained.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   We get trained, meaning how to study the Bible.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   I would say 90% of what I do at church, I was not taught in seminary.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   They don't teach you. I remember the first baptism that I did, I had no idea what I was doing.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   I just remember what my older friends did and I just copied it.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   And then when they told me, "Why did you do that?" I said, "I don't know."
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   They did it.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   So it took me a while to figure out why am I doing it this way.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   Same thing with communion. Why am I doing this?
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   So it kind of forced me to question everything that we're doing at church.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720]   Oh, this is what we're doing. Oh, this is what we're doing.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   And I realized so many things that I was doing, I just did it because that's just what I saw.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   But everything that we do, we have some kind of training.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   But the true training does not happen in classrooms.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   It doesn't happen in classrooms.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   That's why when you go look for a job, it's good that you have training,
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   meaning that you were taught in a classroom.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.720]   But usually what do they look for? Experience.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   Because what they really value more than your education is,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   do you actually know how to do this? Not do you have a degree.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.720]   I remember years ago when I was younger, I was like 19 or 20,
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   I got a job at Hughes Aircraft as a janitor, and I know I shared this before.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   And for eight hours a day, I had to clean trash can and vacuum.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   And it was in semi-darkness because I had to go to the other side of the building to turn on the light.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   There was just enough light so that I wouldn't have to waste time going to the other end.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   So eight hours a day, by myself with no human contact,
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   I was picking up trash and cleaning up, doing vacuum.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.720]   And I remember about a month and a half to two months into it,
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.720]   I started hearing my own voice.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.720]   Because it's just no human contact, zero.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   This is before cell phones, the Internet, there's nothing.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   So basically once you go to work, it's just dead silence, dim light,
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   and you're throwing away trash.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   And I remember carrying the trash out with my both hands to the dumpster,
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   and I started talking to myself.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.720]   What? What did he say? What? What?
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.720]   And then I caught myself talking like, "What are you doing? You're crazy!"
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   And I said, "Oh, this is what happens to people who are isolated for a long period of time."
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.720]   Because I had no human contact at night, and then during the day, I attended class by myself.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   And so I had literally no human contact.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   So I asked my boss, "I don't think I can do this anymore. I'm going to go crazy."
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   I'm not going to be able to distinguish between real voice and fake voice, right?
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   So he said, "Well, the only other position we have open is the guy who was cleaning the toilets, he quit."
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   And I said, "Where is it?"
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720]   He said, "Oh, it's in the other building."
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.720]   And that's where all the nighttime workers were hanging out.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   So I said, "Oh, that's got to be better than this."
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.720]   So I said, "Okay, I'll take it."
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   So I walked in, and they had about 23 different toilets.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   It was a huge building. It was a huge aircraft in Fullerton.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   So my job was to walk around from 5 to 2 in the morning to clean up all the bathrooms.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.720]   And I got so many stories from this period of my life, which I won't get into today.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:42.720]   But I remember the first time doing the job, he said, "Oh, this couple who is doing this, they're going to train you."
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   And I remember when they were training me, they just would tackle the toilet with bare hands.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   They'd take the brush, and then they would wipe it down.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   And I said, "Really?"
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   And then they looked at me. It's like, "Oh, okay, okay. So here's what you're supposed to do."
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   So they opened up their cart, and in the cart, they had this huge apron, rubber apron,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.720]   you know the kind that they had at the butcher where every part of them is protected.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.720]   So they had this rubber apron that comes from the neck all the way down to the floor.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   So it covers your whole body.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   And then they had a glove that comes all the way beyond your elbow, both of them.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   And then you wear a mask, and then you have a hood.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.720]   So basically, if anything splatters, the only part that's not protected are your eyes.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   So you wear glasses.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.720]   So I said, "Okay, all right, I can do this. This is better than being in darkness all night."
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:45.720]   So I did it, and then even the brush isn't that typical, like a foot and a half brush.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   It's just like three feet, you know what I mean?
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:54.720]   So I can get to the toilet from a distance, so if it splashed, I have enough time to jump out of the way.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   So the first two to three weeks, I did exactly what they told me to do,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   or thought like, "Oh, this is how to protect yourself from this junk," right?
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.720]   So I would go into the bathrooms, and, you know, again, I learned so many things.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.720]   I won't get into it today.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.720]   I'm so tempted to tell you.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   One of these days, okay, maybe at the retreat when we have more time,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   I learned so many things about different cultures through their bowel movements.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   Anyway, it has nothing to do with the sermon, so I'm not going to sidetrack.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   So after about a week and a half of this, it's like, "I can't do this because it would take forever."
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   And then every time I need to take a break, I got to, you know, hose down, take all things off, wash my hand,
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.720]   and I got to go take a break, and then five minutes later, I got to come back, put it all back on.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.720]   And so every bathroom was a chore. I was like, "I can't reach in there. There's a spot underneath. I can't get to it."
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.720]   So every day, something was coming off.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   "I can't wear this hat. It's too hot in here."
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   And I gave the brush. "I can't reach this with a brush. I get the shorter one."
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   Then after, "Oh, I can't bend with this apron on. I can't take this off."
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.720]   Eventually, I took everything off, and I was doing exactly what they were doing.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   Because I was able to do it half the time and do it much faster and effectively,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.720]   because I wasn't concerned about getting dirty.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   Obviously, you know, I'd have to go home and take a shower, you know, and clean myself.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   But if I wanted to do this job effectively, I had to do what they're doing.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.720]   What does this have to do with the sermon?
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   There's so much training that you can get in the classroom because you're hearing,
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.720]   and people are telling you, "This is what you're supposed to do."
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Until you're willing to get dirty, you're never really going to learn.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   If our natural inclination is, "You see sin in other people. You see sin in circumstance. You see difficulty."
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   And our natural instinct is to put on the full garb or just stay away from that,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   your training is always in theory.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.720]   You don't really know how to disciple. You don't really know how to love.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.720]   You don't really know how to persevere because it's all in theory.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:25.720]   It isn't until we are willing to get dirty, just like Christ came and took on humanity
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:33.720]   and walked among the dirt with us, that He was able to sympathize with our weaknesses.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   God is working to train us to walk in the same shoes that He walked in,
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.720]   to be in the midst of sinners.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.720]   And if you're in the midst of sinners, you're going to have some of that stuff splash on you.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   But God is doing that to train us.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   And that's why He said, "If you want to come after me, you take up the cross too.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.720]   And you deny yourself and follow me."
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   In God's perfect plan, He allows certain things to happen in our lives.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.720]   A God who is perfect, a God who loves us, has a specific reason why He placed you
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   and allow you to experience what you are experiencing now.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   So my prayer is that this morning as we participate in this communion, to recognize
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:31.720]   maybe we are looking at our physical circumstance and our past through our own physical lens,
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:38.720]   but this morning that we would look at it through the lens of Christ who was crucified on our behalf.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.720]   And it changes everything.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.720]   If you believe that a loving, perfect, sovereign God is the one who placed us where we're at,
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.720]   it changes everything.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.720]   So this morning as we prepare for our communion, as we ask the praise team to come,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.720]   I want to open up our communion with us in 1 Corinthians 11.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   As I read the passage, after I read it, I want to give you a few minutes to take some time
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   to meditate and think.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.720]   And again, communion is meant for baptized believers.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:16.720]   So baptism is our union with Christ, and communion is like celebrating the anniversary
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.720]   so that we may be renewed in our relationship with Christ.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   So if you have not been baptized and you're not a believer, we ask that you would just not participate in it,
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.720]   just kind of take some time to think carefully.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.720]   Do I really believe this? Is this true?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   If you are a believer, again, we want you to take it seriously.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.720]   Don't take it lightly.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.720]   Why was this given to us? For what purpose?
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:46.720]   And how would it have the effect that God had for us when he ordained this time?
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.720]   In 1 Corinthians 11.23, it says, "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread,
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.720]   and when he had given things, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.720]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.720]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   So let's take some time to contemplate, to pray, to confess, and to honor Christ, okay?
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:31.720]   As the music is being played, and after a few minutes, I will tap my hand on the podium,
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.720]   and we will participate together, okay, all at once.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.720]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team begins to prepare.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   [Prayer begins]
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   [Music]
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   [Music]
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   [Music]
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:59.720]   [Music]
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   [Music]
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.720]   [Music]
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   [Music]
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:34.720]   [Music]
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.720]   [Music]
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   [Music]
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:56.720]   [Music]
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.720]   [Music]
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.720]   [Music]
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   [Music]
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.720]   [Music]
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:23.720]   [Music]
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.720]   [Music]
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   [Music]
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.720]   [Music]
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:44.720]   [Music]
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   Again, if you've done this before, obviously you know there's two layers to this,
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:55.720]   and the first part, if you open it, will unveil the wafer,
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.720]   and then the second part will be the juice, okay?
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.720]   So it's a little tricky, so...
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   I'll give you a minute to do that, and if you take the first layer off, the wafer will come out,
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.720]   and then the second layer will expose the juice here.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   Okay, so if you're ready, we're going to participate together.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.720]   All right.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   Okay, let's pray.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:44.720]   Gracious Father, we thank you for these elements and what it symbolizes for us,
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   that Christ's body, which is broken for us, the blood that he shed for our atonement,
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.720]   that we may be justified, Lord God, as sinners before you.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:03.720]   We pray, Father, that as we continue to strive not to drift, but to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   what does it mean to love you, to honor you, to worship you?
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.720]   I pray that you would renew us so that our greatest joy may be our fellowship with you
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   and not anything in this world.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   Help us to be people, Lord God, where our souls, our hearts, our mind, our flesh
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   are firmly planted and grounded upon Christ.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:46.720]   [music]
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   My worth is not in what I own,
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:57.720]   not in the strength of flesh and bone,
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:06.720]   but in the costly wounds of love at the cross.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:14.720]   My worth is not in skill or name,
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.720]   in win or lose, in pride or shame,
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:29.720]   but in the blood of Christ that flowed at the cross.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:37.720]   I rejoice in my Redeemer,
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   greatest treasure, wellspring of my soul.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.720]   I will trust in Him, no other.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.720]   My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   As summer flowers we fade and die,
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   fame, youth, and beauty hurry by.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   But life eternal calls to us at the cross.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   I will not boast in wealth or might,
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   or human wisdom's fading light,
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   but I will boast in knowing Christ at the cross.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:54.720]   I rejoice in my Redeemer,
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.720]   greatest treasure, wellspring of my soul.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.720]   I will trust in Him, no other.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:11.720]   My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:26.720]   Two wonders here that I confess,
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.720]   my worth and my unworthiness,
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:40.720]   my value fake, my ransom paid at the cross.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   I rejoice in my Redeemer,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   greatest treasure, wellspring of my soul.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:59.720]   I will trust in Him, no other.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:11.720]   I rejoice in my Redeemer,
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:17.720]   greatest treasure, wellspring of my soul.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:22.720]   I will trust in Him, no other.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:28.720]   My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.720]   (soft music)
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   - All right, let's pray.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   1 Peter chapter 4, 12 to 14.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.720]   Beloved, do not be surprised at the fire ordeal among you,
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.720]   which comes upon you for your testing,
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   as though some strange things are happening to you.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   But to the degree that you share the suffering of Christ,
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.720]   keep on rejoicing,
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.720]   so that also at the revelation of His glory,
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   you may rejoice with exaltation.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.720]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ,
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.720]   and of God rests on you.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   Lord, help us to believe this with all our heart,
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.720]   that we would not live for the temporary,
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.720]   but for the eternal.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.720]   Help us, Lord God, to wait eagerly
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.720]   for the second coming of Christ,
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   as our life is now hidden with Christ,
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.720]   that when He comes in glory,
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.720]   that we will be glorified in Him.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   I pray that our longing, our desire,
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.720]   will be firmly placed on the promises
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   that was given to us through Jesus.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.720]   For that end, I pray that you would help us,
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.720]   train us, sanctify us,
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.720]   that your name may be honored,
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.720]   and that the world may know
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.720]   that there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
