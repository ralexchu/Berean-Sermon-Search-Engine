[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   - All right, good morning.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.700]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.580]   We have actually quite a few announcements
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.700]   for me to go through, so let me get started on this.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:56.180]   First of all, our all church retreat signups have begun,
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.140]   and we have an early registration
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.200]   that's happening until April 30th.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.340]   So if you are planning to come to that,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.860]   and again, this is August 11th through August 13th,
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.780]   that's Friday through Sunday,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.540]   we will most likely have a service here
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.620]   because there's quite a few people who are not able to go.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.400]   We'll have one service here on that Sunday,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.860]   but the rest of us will be up at the retreat site.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.100]   And so the early registration fee,
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.960]   so all the information that you need for that,
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.620]   go on the website, go on the church app,
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.100]   and they'll be able to give you more information on that.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.100]   And again, you have to register and pay for that
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.500]   by April 30th, and after that,
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.140]   there'll be late registration fee,
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.740]   okay, just to keep that in mind.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.400]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.200]   we don't know exactly how many more years
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.340]   that we're able to do this
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.720]   just 'cause of the size of our church,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.640]   so I highly encourage you to take advantage of that
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.900]   as we have it this year.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.720]   After our Easter service, after our resurrection service,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.940]   not next Sunday, but the Saturday comes after that,
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.760]   our outreach team on April 15th,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.960]   so that's a Saturday from 10 to 11, 20 a.m.,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.680]   they're gonna be having an open gospel Q&A meeting,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.860]   meaning if you have friends or family
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.240]   or people that you know who are interested or seeking,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.480]   there will be an opportunity on that day,
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.560]   on Saturday morning, to be able to ask questions
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.220]   and interact with other people
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.640]   who will be able to make the gospel more clear to them.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.880]   So that's happening on, again, on April 15th,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.340]   not this coming Saturday, but the Saturday after that.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.940]   So please let us know if you are planning to come
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.780]   or bring somebody to that event.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.160]   Our next membership class,
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.360]   not this coming Sunday, but Sunday after,
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.160]   our new round of membership class is happening.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.320]   This is a eight-week course from 9 to 10, 20 a.m.,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.160]   and again, Pastor Nate is the one
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.680]   who is taking the sign-up for that,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   so you can, again, go to our church website,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.020]   Facebook, our church app,
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.200]   and there will be a place where you can sign up for that.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.660]   And again, it's an eight-week course,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.100]   an hour and a half of the time that we're doing,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.460]   so please sign up for that.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:07.940]   Our members meeting is happening on April 23rd at 1.30 p.m.,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.820]   so if you are planning to, or please make note of that,
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.120]   and that Sunday, we have a,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.500]   we have lunch not provided that we're selling, okay?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.800]   This is for a fundraiser for our South Korea mission trip
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.100]   that's happening this summer,
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.780]   and so please stick around for that,
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.500]   and we'll have lunch provided in that way,
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.420]   and then the members meeting will happen at 1.30.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.340]   And then softball tournament.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.700]   We haven't had a softball tournament
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.260]   in about three or four years,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.380]   and so we're picking that up,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.920]   and this is a mission fundraiser that we have,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.140]   and again, the funds are gonna go to help the student.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.180]   There's about 20 of us
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.020]   who are headed out to South Korea this summer,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.660]   and the funds will be used for that.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   And so if you are interested in playing softball,
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.260]   and you could be in various levels.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.540]   Some of you guys are excellent,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.660]   and you've been waiting for this,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.100]   and so you're gonna come and help us win,
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.160]   and then some of you guys are gonna come to have fun.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.860]   So whichever group you're a part of,
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.020]   there is space for you, so just sign up,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.640]   and then they'll assign you to the proper team,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   so please come and join and help us out with that,
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.740]   or just give us your money.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.260]   It's a fundraiser, so anything will be appreciated.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.260]   So that softball tournament is happening on May 20th.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.260]   It's an all-day tournament.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.940]   This is for the ladies and the men.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.980]   It's gonna be happening on the same day, okay?
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.220]   Again, this is a tournament not just for within church,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.540]   but we usually have anywhere from 15 to,
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.220]   and we've had as large as 36 different churches that come,
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.700]   so it's a pretty big tournament.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   We're not expecting that big of a tournament this year
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.520]   because we haven't had it for a while,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.420]   but again, we will be competing against other churches,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.620]   so please come and participate in that.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.100]   And then the main thing is,
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.780]   obviously you guys know today is Palm Sunday,
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.140]   so Palm Sunday today is a kickoff
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.520]   for the events that will be taking place this week.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.620]   The gospel account of Jesus' last day
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.020]   probably has more information on the last week of Jesus
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.780]   than any other time of his life.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.200]   In fact, the gospel of John, half of the gospel,
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.860]   is about the last week of Jesus,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.860]   and so starting off today, each day,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.180]   starting from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.300]   we're going to be walking through
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.680]   Jesus' last week of timeline.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.900]   What did he do on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.800]   How did that prepare him and get him to the cross
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.140]   so that next Sunday when we come
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.020]   to celebrate his resurrection
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.060]   that we would really be able to understand Jesus' mindset?
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.260]   So we're gonna be walking with him each day.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.240]   So starting from tomorrow at 7.30,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.900]   we'll be meeting at church,
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.620]   and one of the pastors will be going over the passage
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.180]   of what Jesus did that day,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.780]   and then we have a member of our church
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.540]   who's gonna be giving testimony,
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.980]   and we'll have time for some worship and for prayer as well.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.500]   And so it'll be about an hour each day,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.420]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.780]   and then on Thursday, we have a Passover meal.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.980]   So those of you who participated in that in the past,
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.180]   you know what it is.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.660]   Basically, on Thursday, Pastor Mark is going to lead us
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.820]   in basically having a Passover meal
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.540]   that Jesus had with his disciples
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.280]   before he went to the cross,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.340]   and he will be going over the meaning
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.880]   of each of the elements
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.120]   and how that prepared Christ for the cross
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.660]   and for Israel and for his disciples.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.300]   And so if you haven't participated in it,
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.140]   that's a great time,
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.540]   and those of you who signed up for it,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.940]   it will be on the cafe side,
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.900]   especially those of you who have small children.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.100]   It's a great way to visually show them
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.820]   how God prepared for the coming of Christ
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.200]   and what he was gonna do on the cross
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.700]   through this Passover meal, okay?
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.620]   So again, that will be taking place there on Thursday,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.220]   and then Friday, we will be having
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.660]   our Good Friday service here.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.100]   So it is a communion service,
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.780]   so we ask you to come prepared for that.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.460]   We are expecting quite a few people
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.020]   to come on Friday night,
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.700]   and so we do have parking variants outside on the street,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.100]   okay, just here.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.860]   Don't just park anywhere, okay?
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.320]   But in front of our church all the way down,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.980]   if you can't find parking, you can park there.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.300]   We were able to secure some extra parking
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.440]   for that Friday,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.180]   so when you come in,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.140]   the attendants will give you directions
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.640]   where to go, where not to go.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.740]   Because we're running out of parking,
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.420]   we've heard from some of our neighbors
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.660]   who don't want us to park there
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.540]   that some of you are just parking and coming.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.060]   You're risking a tow job,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.160]   whatever that means.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.020]   So it's about $440 if you get it towed.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.380]   That's the last time I remember.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.820]   So try not to park there.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.140]   We're gonna try to put signs there
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.980]   asking you not to park in those areas,
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.240]   but we were able to secure some other parking areas,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.380]   so when you come in,
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.820]   make sure you're following directions
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.020]   and the attendants will show you where to go,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.980]   especially this Friday.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.340]   Friday's gonna be a pretty packed house.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.220]   If you come early and you're able to sit in this room,
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.540]   we will have the communion happening here.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.540]   The cafe is gonna be gutted out
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.540]   and we're gonna be in like a service style
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.580]   just with chairs,
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.940]   and so there will be communion
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.780]   that will be taking place over there as well
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.380]   if you're sitting on that side, okay?
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.060]   We have about 550 chairs in this room.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.940]   That's with every single chair packed.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.240]   Last time we had this, we had about 650.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.980]   We're expecting more than that this Friday,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.180]   so a good number of you
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.180]   are gonna end up going to that area.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   So just when you come in and it's packed,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.020]   just go to that,
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.580]   and then the parents with small children,
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.420]   if you're coming,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.260]   that cry room is gonna be reserved for you.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.360]   The communion will not be taking place there.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.180]   You will have to come to the other side
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.940]   to be able to participate in communion,
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.060]   but again, because it is going to be packed,
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.740]   we're gonna have to ask you to help us with that,
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.620]   and then along with that on Sunday,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.480]   again, even on regular attendance,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.140]   we have parking issues,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.700]   so if you are attending the first service
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.780]   and you are planning to go off campus
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.900]   to have lunch or whatever with your family,
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.300]   we ask that you would leave just a little bit earlier, okay?
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.460]   Instead of leaving at 11,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.860]   leave like 10 minutes before
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.780]   so that the people who come to the second service,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.180]   that we would have plenty of parking, right?
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.140]   In about a month,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.900]   we've secured some parking that's away from our site,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.860]   so we're gonna have a shuttle system going out,
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.820]   so by then, we'd be okay,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.420]   but we won't have that for about another month,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.540]   so until then, we ask that you guys help us out
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.460]   and try to make room for the parking situation, okay?
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.480]   That's a lot.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.160]   So if you came to service,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.260]   please take one of these as a reminder to you,
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.200]   and on our church website and on the Facebook,
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.820]   we will be going through the passages,
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.140]   so if you are not able to come
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.420]   and you just kinda wanna follow along online,
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.780]   there will be on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.020]   that this is the passage that we should do devotions on
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.700]   and to just kinda follow along
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.580]   so that when you come Friday to participate in communion,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.580]   that your hearts were prepared all week for that,
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.940]   and then when we come to celebrate his resurrection,
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.940]   that we had seven days of preparing our hearts
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.900]   for that celebration as well, okay?
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.060]   So that's a lot of announcements,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.280]   but please keep that in mind,
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.160]   and really, I really wanna encourage you to take this week
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.300]   to calibrate our hearts.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.460]   Like what God desires more than anything else
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.480]   is people who will worship him in spirit and in truth,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.160]   and spirit and truth worship is not just something you do
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.920]   because you come on Sunday.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.760]   It's because you've prepared your hearts,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.400]   and worship is something that you do as a response
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.720]   to what Christ has done for us,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.280]   and so we wanna make sure that this week
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.520]   is used for that purpose,
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.320]   and we ask you to do your best to come in,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.240]   but if you can't,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   we will have some things online for you as well, okay?
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.120]   All right, so let me pray for us for our offering,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.480]   and if you are gonna give electronically, it will be there,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.580]   and then those of you who are gonna give physically,
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.520]   we have a physical offering box in the back
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.720]   as you are leaving, okay?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.820]   All right, let's pray.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:02.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your goodness,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.880]   your patience, your love that you pour upon us,
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   some of it we are aware of,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   some of it that we are not aware of.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.800]   Lord, as we face this important week,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.360]   I pray that you would ready our hearts
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.760]   that this worship today would start us off
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.160]   and cause us, Lord God, to be eagerly anticipating
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.720]   the celebration that we will have,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.560]   and we pray that our Friday communion
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.880]   would really stir our hearts, Lord God,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.240]   to worship you in spirit and in truth,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.720]   that all that you have given us,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.640]   all that you have done for us,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.880]   that you would receive all the glory and all the worship.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.680]   May this offering that we give
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.400]   be given as an act of worship to you,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.920]   may it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.960]   (gentle piano music)
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.040]   (gentle piano music)
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.120]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.200]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.280]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:19.360]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:31.400]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.320]   (gentle piano music)
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:44.480]   Church family, let's all rise together
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.760]   as we come before God.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.280]   (upbeat music)

[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:35.020]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.740]   to Luke chapter 19,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:42.700]   and we will be reading from verse 28 to verse 44.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.200]   Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem kicks off
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.380]   the Passion Week as He is very deliberately,
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.960]   everything that He is doing,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.600]   is very deliberately preparing His disciples and Himself
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.960]   to head toward the cross and ultimately the resurrection
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.000]   that we will be celebrating on Sunday.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.400]   And so today is the kickoff
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.000]   as we remember the triumphal entry.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.320]   And what significance does that have
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.520]   in what Jesus does on the cross?
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.920]   So let me read, starting from verse 28.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.400]   After He had said these things,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.760]   He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.320]   when He approached Bethphage and Bethany
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.800]   near the mount that is called Olivet.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.120]   He sent two of the disciples saying,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.720]   "Go into the village ahead of you.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.320]   "There, as you enter, you will find a cold tide
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.080]   "on which no one yet has ever sat.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.980]   "Untie it and bring it here.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.200]   "If anyone asks you, why are you untying it?
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.440]   "You shall say, the Lord has need of it."
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.560]   So those who were sent went away
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.160]   and found it just as He had told them.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.960]   As they were untying the colt, its owner said to them,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.600]   "Why are you untying the colt?"
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.800]   They said, "The Lord has need of it."
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.120]   They brought it to Jesus and they threw their coats
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.640]   on the colt and put Jesus on it.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.680]   And He was going, they were spreading their coats
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.520]   on the road.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.760]   As soon as He was approaching near the descent
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.680]   of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.280]   began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.640]   for all the miracles which they had seen,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.000]   shouting, "Blessed is the King who comes
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   "in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.920]   "and glory in the highest."
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.580]   Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him,
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.660]   "Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.300]   But Jesus answered, "I tell you, if these become silent,
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.280]   "the stones will cry out."
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.700]   and wept over it, saying, "If you had known in this day,
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.600]   "even you, the things which make for peace,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.160]   "but now they have been hidden from your eyes.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.620]   "For the days will come upon you
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.520]   "when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.160]   "and surround you and hem you in on every side.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.280]   "And they will level you to the ground
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.660]   "and your children within you,
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.800]   "and they will not leave in you one stone upon another
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.640]   "because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.480]   Let's pray.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:05.000]   Gracious Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.120]   We pray, Father God, of softening of our hearts.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.700]   That we may hear and understand and apply
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.180]   all that you have given us through the word.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.580]   May your word go forth and not return
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.860]   until it has accomplished what you have ordained it to do.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.900]   We ask for your guidance and your Holy Spirit.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:33.340]   Some of you guys may remember years ago, right,
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.420]   if you're a basketball fan,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   when LeBron James left his hometown team, Cleveland, Ohio,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:44.000]   to join another team.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.360]   Remember the response that they had in Ohio.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.220]   People were burning his jerseys and hating him,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.280]   and they were literally going to his house.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.380]   And they loved that man
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.320]   and almost saw him as their messiah
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.540]   until he decided to go to another team, Miami Heat.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.840]   And he was hated, bitterly hated.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.040]   And I've never seen anybody who's received that much hate
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.720]   from a sports team.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.600]   And so, when you look back at it,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.040]   it's like, why were they so angry, right?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.760]   He has every right to go to Miami
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.000]   if he thinks that that's where
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   he's gonna win the championship.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.160]   And part of the reason why I think why Ohio,
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.560]   Cleveland Cavaliers fans were so angry
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.280]   is because they put so much hope in him.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.120]   And if you know anything about Cleveland, Ohio,
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.200]   the economy is not good.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.640]   And even by LeBron himself, he said he grew up in poverty.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.600]   And so, there's not a lot of things
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.880]   that they can put their hope on.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.520]   And so, this basketball team kinda was their escape.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.160]   And LeBron was the guy who would have no chance whatsoever,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.000]   but here's this messiah figure, right,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.200]   that comes into town.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.440]   And for the first time in their basketball career,
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.040]   that maybe they have some hope
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.500]   that they're going to win the championship.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.720]   And all of a sudden, when he decides to leave,
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.760]   it wasn't just a basketball player leaving.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.720]   It was their hopes, their dreams, their joy,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.960]   their life that was leaving with him.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.840]   And I don't think I'm exaggerating.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.600]   And then part of the reason why they were so angry with him
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.640]   was because of that.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.280]   It wasn't just a basketball team, kinda like Lakers.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.120]   If it's not Lakers, it's something else.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   We have Dodgers, we have Angels, we have Clippers, right?
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.920]   So, we have other teams, right?
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.520]   But over there, that's it.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.480]   That's all that they had, right?
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   Palm Sunday is a day where Jesus comes in,
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.520]   supposedly riding, and people are swinging their palm trees
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.200]   and palm branches,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.680]   meaning that they were welcoming their king.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.200]   And the reason why there was such a stir for that
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.080]   is because Israel was in a very similar situation
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.640]   for hundreds of years.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.080]   They were dominated by a foreign government.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.360]   They came into the Promised Land
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.320]   thinking that they're gonna live and prosper,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.320]   and they're going to be the superpower.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.520]   And at one point, it looked like
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.020]   they might actually have that, but it didn't last long.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.680]   Just as God said, that if you obey me, you will be blessed.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.180]   If you disobey me, you will be cursed.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.160]   And it doesn't take long for them to fall under that curse,
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.640]   and even under that curse and judgment of God
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.360]   for hundreds of years, one kingdom after another kingdom.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.160]   So, by the time that Christ appears,
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.720]   they had hundreds of years of oppression
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.040]   from these pagan governments.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.240]   And at that time, obviously, the Roman government
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.040]   was the one who was oppressing them.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.720]   So, throughout their history,
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   we're not just talking about a decade or one generation.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.640]   We're talking about generation after generation
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.460]   after generation.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.960]   And no matter how life got, they said,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.680]   "One day, our Messiah's gonna come,
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.180]   "and he's gonna be the conquering king.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.600]   "He's gonna place us back to where we belong."
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.320]   And so, they've been waiting for him, waiting for him.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.080]   So, you can imagine the kind of stir that they had
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   when Jesus was coming into town.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   In fact, the Bible has over 100 different prophecies
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.280]   about the coming Messiah,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   and Jesus fulfills every single one of them.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.400]   And if there was any doubt that this was the Messiah,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.440]   in Zechariah 9, 9, and this is,
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.920]   whether you are a scholar
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.880]   or whether you're just a common person,
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.400]   everybody in Israel knew about this prophecy.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.280]   When the king comes, he's gonna be riding on a donkey,
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.240]   Zechariah 9, 9.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.820]   "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.460]   "Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.880]   "Behold, your king is coming to you,
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.300]   "righteous and having salvation,
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.220]   "as he humble and mounted on a donkey,
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.060]   "on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.960]   Do you remember, I wasn't on this pulpit
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   for the last two weeks, but a few weeks ago,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.120]   we were talking about how Jesus' popularity
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.400]   was just booming, right, right off the bat.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   They wouldn't leave him alone, right?
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.920]   And he couldn't even teach on the shore,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.440]   so he had to get on a boat and pull himself away
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.120]   so that he was able to address the crowd.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.720]   So the crowd was growing, and they were fanatical.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.920]   They weren't just half-hearted interest.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.800]   I mean, they were packing up their bags
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.240]   and following everywhere he went.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.120]   So by the time he feeds the 5,000,
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.000]   thousands of people just would not leave him alone, right?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.840]   And he was so tired everywhere he went,
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   even on a boat where professional fishermen
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.720]   think that they're gonna die,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.280]   Jesus couldn't wake up, he was so tired.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.380]   That's how popular he was.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.280]   So imagine if that kind of popularity happened
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.440]   in the beginning of his ministry,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.920]   this is three years of this, right?
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.080]   Three years of him healing the sick,
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.720]   walking on the water, calming the storm,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.080]   healing lepers, three years of this.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.400]   So imagine the frenzy around Jesus everywhere he went.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.800]   So if that wasn't enough,
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.840]   right before he comes into Jerusalem,
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.000]   remember what he does in John chapter 11?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.640]   He raises Lazarus from the dead.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.920]   And this was very public.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   He deliberately waits until he's dead,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.840]   and he's in there for many days
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.040]   so that they can guarantee that everybody knew
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.080]   that this was, that a miracle took place.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.240]   In fact, this miracle was so public and so obvious,
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.880]   even the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.320]   who wanted to get rid of him
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.680]   couldn't deny that a miracle happened.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.480]   And so imagine the crowd that gathered together
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.640]   to receive him in Jerusalem.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.680]   They said typically, historians of that time will say,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.520]   during the Passover, even without Jesus coming into town,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.260]   there will be hundreds of thousands of Jews
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.000]   who traveled, some of them, for weeks to get to Jerusalem
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.220]   to be able to celebrate the Passover.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.400]   But can you imagine the crowd that gathered together
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.260]   when Jesus was coming in?
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.520]   On top of the regular Jews who were coming into town
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.440]   because of Passover, they had hundreds of thousands
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.560]   probably added to that.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.240]   Some estimate as large as a million people.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.680]   Now, in today's number, millions of people,
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.560]   still a lot of people, but at that time,
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.680]   I mean, that was huge.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.800]   That was probably the largest crowd
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.640]   that they may have ever seen.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.520]   And we can't be for sure exactly how many were gathered,
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   but can you imagine the frenzy around this?
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.200]   And Jesus comes in on this donkey
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.400]   to make sure that everybody knew.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.860]   If anybody had any question of who he was,
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.800]   up to this point, remember every time Jesus
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.220]   would perform a miracle, remember what he would say to them?
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.180]   Don't tell people.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.580]   It's not time yet, don't tell people.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.560]   And even the demons, as they were declaring who he was,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.180]   Jesus would command them not to say anything to people
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.620]   because he knew this was gonna happen.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.980]   He knew that people were gonna gather.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.140]   He knew that people were going to forcefully make him king.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.880]   But now is time.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.800]   There was no question about who he was.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.640]   He comes in, the scripture says
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.600]   that the people were shaking palm branches,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.080]   and the significance of the palm branch,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.760]   typically they did that to receive armies
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.120]   that would go into battle,
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.840]   and if they come back in victory,
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.520]   that's when they would take the palm branches out,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.320]   and then they would wave it in celebration.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.880]   So you have to understand that the palm branch
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.240]   in and of itself, the significance behind that,
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.160]   if your nation went to war,
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.280]   and your soldiers came back defeated,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.060]   which means that you, your children, your grandchildren,
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.360]   are gonna be slaves.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.160]   Your life is over.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.880]   It's not just you lost the battle,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.960]   and you don't have the proper standing in the world.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.760]   It literally means that your life is over.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   Everybody under that nation, their life is over.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.580]   So for generations to come, you may be slaves.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.560]   So can you imagine the celebration of palm branches
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.700]   when they were shaking this, what it signified?
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:52.720]   See, that's the kind of celebration that was going on
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.960]   when Jesus was coming in.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.080]   In fact, Matthew himself,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.680]   when he describes this stir in Jerusalem,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.440]   he uses the word seismic,
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.760]   and you know what that word means.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   Seismic basically is talking about an earthquake,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.520]   and he said that's the kind of frenzy there was in Jerusalem
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.320]   when Jesus was coming into town.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.000]   But there's two strange things
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   that they should have noticed.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.360]   In the midst of this tremendous parade,
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.440]   people are yelling out, screaming,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.880]   "Hosanna, hosanna, our Messiah has come to deliver us."
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.120]   That the man who we've been waiting for
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.760]   for hundreds of years,
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.040]   every single problem that we've had, here's our answer.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.160]   He's our healer, here's our refuge, here's our king.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.520]   He's the one who provides, he feeds us.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.580]   But there's two obvious things that they should have noticed.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.240]   One, the fact that Jesus was coming on a donkey.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.120]   Now, we know clearly that this was prophesied
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.000]   hundreds of years before Jesus came,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.180]   that when the Messiah shows up,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.960]   he's gonna be riding on a donkey.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.680]   But even in their own prophecy,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.440]   if they were paying attention,
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.400]   they should have asked, and they should have noticed,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.560]   why is a conquering king coming on a donkey?
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.320]   Because the palm branches and the donkey just did not fit,
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.920]   because the palm branches basically meant that he conquered,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.800]   or he's kind of come in to conquer.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   And yet, in the prophecy, it says,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.100]   "Your king is coming to you,
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.640]   "righteous and having salvation as he,
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.440]   "humble and mounted on a donkey,"
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.780]   on a colt, the foal of a donkey, humble.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.280]   Why is a conquering king coming humbled?
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.320]   Now, we can look at that as maybe
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.520]   they just kind of skimmed over it,
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.480]   maybe they just weren't thinking critically.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.600]   But the second part they should have noticed for sure,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.640]   in the midst of this tremendous seismic celebration,
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.000]   it says in verse 41 and 42 of Luke chapter 19,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.360]   "And when he drew near and saw the city,
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.440]   "he wept over it."
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.480]   He wept, right?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.280]   Have you ever been in a situation
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.960]   where you're celebrating somebody's birthday,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.600]   and the person that you're celebrating
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.280]   is sitting there and just crying, right?
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.360]   Would you just keep eating?
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.160]   I mean, you're there to celebrate that person's birthday,
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.640]   and everybody's celebrating and having food,
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.960]   and the person that you're celebrating,
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.660]   right before you blow out the candle, is just weeping.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.960]   It would be strange if that's happening,
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.920]   and everybody's like, "Hey, you guys had enough food?"
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.540]   And the person that you're celebrating is weeping.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.620]   That's what we see here.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.680]   Jesus is coming in, they're celebrating,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.400]   they're giving praise, and he's not just crying,
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.520]   it says that he's weeping.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.040]   The word here isn't just that he shed tears.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.480]   The word here in Greek means that he was wailing.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.960]   It was obvious, it was uncontrollable sobbing.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.880]   That's the word that is used here
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.760]   to describe Jesus' weeping.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.000]   But you know what's interesting is,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.920]   if you read the account in the Gospels,
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.600]   there's no mention of anybody asking questions, right?
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.520]   Remember when Jesus was telling his disciples
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.640]   that I'm gonna go to the cross,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.160]   and I'm gonna be rejected by the leaders,
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.200]   and they're gonna kill me,
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.520]   and I'm gonna resurrect on the third day?
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.920]   And the disciples hear him, and they say,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.200]   well, who's gonna sit on the left or the right?
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.160]   Right?
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.520]   He said, "I just told you I'm gonna die."
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.200]   Right, and in the Gospel of Mark,
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.760]   he tells them three separate times,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.440]   and Mark makes it very clear
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.060]   that Jesus made this very clear to his disciples,
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.720]   but they didn't understand.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.960]   And because they didn't understand,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.400]   they just kinda, "Oh, okay," and they just
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.520]   start talking about, well, who's gonna be
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.720]   to the left or to the right, right?
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.320]   They were debating who's the greatest
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.440]   when Jesus just told them he's gonna be beaten
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.520]   and be crucified.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.600]   Well, we see a similar scene here
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.760]   where you have this parade going on,
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   Jesus is weeping, and there's no mention
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.080]   of anybody even asking questions.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.240]   Right, and they say, "Why is he weeping?
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.200]   "What is this weeping about?
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.040]   "Why is he weeping?
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.880]   "We're celebrating.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.080]   "Like, we're all elated about him coming in.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.720]   "He's going to be our king, but why is he weeping?"
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.400]   No question asked.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.520]   They just keep celebrating.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.280]   Clearly, they did not understand.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:09.680]   'Cause to them, they were receiving him as their king.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.200]   This is the guy we've been waiting for
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.520]   for hundreds of years.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.000]   Our great-great-great-grandfather has been telling us
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.240]   about him coming in, and so for them,
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.640]   this was a great celebration.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.360]   But from Jesus' perspective, the celebration
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.880]   was the epitome of their rejection
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.600]   because they did not understand why he came.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.400]   In John 1:5, he says, "The light shines in darkness,
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.480]   "but the darkness has not understood it."
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.720]   The Pharisees, the Pharisees, I mean,
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.360]   they get a bad name in the New Testament,
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.440]   but they were created because they were concerned
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.720]   about the Hellenistic influence,
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.160]   the secular influence coming into Israel,
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.860]   so they said, "Let's create a group, a holiness group,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.620]   "because our forefathers went into captivity
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.640]   "because they didn't obey the law."
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.400]   So we're gonna make sure this never happens.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.720]   So the word Pharisee basically means holy,
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.200]   to be set apart.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.640]   We're gonna create this group,
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.240]   and we're gonna make sure that we keep the law
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.320]   so that this never happens.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.080]   That's why they were so stickler about the law
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.320]   because keeping the law, for them,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.600]   was an avenue to receive the blessing of God.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.160]   And that's why they were constantly concerned,
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.040]   "Hey, you're breaking the Sabbath.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:26.940]   "You're not supposed to do that.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.980]   "You're not supposed to be there."
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.740]   Jesus never broke the law.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.180]   He broke their tradition.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.500]   What they thought the law should,
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.900]   how it should be applied.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.340]   And so they came up with 600 separate laws
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.140]   of that's what the Bible says,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.780]   but this is how it should be applied,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.380]   and Jesus didn't follow these rules.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.140]   So if Jesus doesn't follow these rules,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.540]   everybody who loves him isn't gonna follow it either.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.020]   So the Pharisees wanted to get rid of him
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.960]   because everything that they'd been working for,
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.460]   Jesus was breaking,
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.120]   because they thought the keeping of the law
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.400]   was what was going to cause them to be restored.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.800]   The Sadducees, on the other hand,
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.640]   they had a different approach.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.760]   They thought that if they became wealthy and influential,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.840]   and if they appeased the Roman government,
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.680]   that eventually that they're gonna be favored.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.040]   They're gonna be able to live in peace.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.840]   So when Jesus comes in, and all of a sudden,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.440]   starts to shake up the nation of Israel,
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.340]   said, "This guy's ruining our work.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.640]   "If we're not careful,
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.780]   "the Romans are gonna think that we're,
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.060]   "this guy's starting a rebellion.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.480]   "They're gonna come squash us."
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.920]   And so in order to maintain what they'd been working for,
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.320]   they had to get rid of this guy.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.580]   The Zealots, these were the militant guys.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.160]   These Pharisees, like, oh, they just talk.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.240]   They're just about theology.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.920]   Sadducees, these liberals,
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.560]   they don't even believe in the resurrection.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.700]   We're gonna make this happen.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.960]   We're gonna buy weapons, and at the right time,
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.920]   we're gonna overthrow this government.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.920]   But Jesus comes and says, "He who lives by the sword
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.160]   "shall die by the sword."
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.640]   That he doesn't make any military move
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.800]   against the nation, against Rome.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.680]   So if he's not gonna help us, he's gonna hurt us.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.320]   So they wanted to get rid of him.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.360]   If you read the Gospels carefully, the Gospels,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.360]   and we look at Jesus' three years of life,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.920]   and he kind of builds up,
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.600]   and all these people following him,
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.880]   and then he goes into Jerusalem, and he says,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.760]   and then he says, "Forget it,"
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   and then he goes to the cross.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.080]   If you read the Gospel carefully,
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.760]   it is an account of a systematic rejection of Jesus
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.940]   in every part of his life.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.880]   Remember, in the Gospel of Luke,
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.200]   in the beginning of his ministry,
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.920]   it starts with his rejection.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.760]   He goes to his hometown to start his ministry,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.840]   and his own family members,
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.520]   his hometown people who recognize him,
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.080]   "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.060]   And then they wanted to throw him off a cliff.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.120]   So he escapes, and then he goes into Galilee,
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.040]   and he does ministry there for about a year and a half
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.360]   to two years, performing all these miracles,
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.240]   and after everything that he has done,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.840]   John chapter 6, 66, it says, "People, they all left him,"
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.200]   because Jesus said, "I am the bread.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.720]   "You're coming to me because you want me
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.740]   "to answer your prayers, you want me to heal people,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.980]   "you want me to feed you, but I do these things
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.880]   "so that you would know that I am the bread."
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.980]   So the whole Gospel of John, the seven I am statements,
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:21.860]   is to correct the false hope that people had.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.700]   You're waiting for the light to come,
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.820]   he says, "I am the light, you're waiting for a leader,
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.900]   "I am the good shepherd."
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:32.140]   And he continues to say, "I am, I am, I am the way
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:32.980]   "and the truth and the life.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.660]   "No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.780]   And as a result of Jesus, what he was saying,
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.240]   systematically they reject him.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.020]   And then Jesus says, when he was going to the cross,
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.700]   remember what he said?
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   He said, "I must be rejected by the leaders of Israel."
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:54.060]   So it's systematically, he's rejected by his hometown,
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.500]   he's rejected by the people that he served,
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.340]   he's rejected by the leadership,
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.660]   and then eventually he gets rejected by his own disciples
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.720]   because they didn't understand him either.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:09.240]   Every part of the way, Jesus breaks the false hope
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.560]   that people were hanging upon this Messiah,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.500]   that before they can understand why he came,
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.660]   he needed to demolish the false hope
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.180]   that they were hanging on Christ for.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:28.520]   The biggest hindrance in Christianity, in the church,
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:34.420]   of truth is the false truth that we have come to embrace.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:39.900]   Some of you immigrated to the United States like I did,
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.820]   and you may remember learning English.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.960]   I came young enough where I don't really have
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.680]   clear memories of trying to learn English,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.120]   'cause I went through ESL early on,
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.420]   and then I remember just speaking English,
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.720]   but I do have those memories.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.520]   Some of you guys were born here, so you may not remember.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.320]   And then some of you guys came later in life, right?
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.780]   We could tell by your accent.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:04.600]   'Cause the later that you came to the United States,
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.620]   the harder it is to get rid of the accent,
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.520]   because you spent a good portion of your life
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.920]   and your childhood speaking another language,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.340]   and so whenever you pick up another language,
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.240]   you always try to put it into the framework
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.480]   of what you've already gotten.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.800]   This is true no matter what country you came from.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.080]   You can tell how long somebody lived here,
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.160]   even if they speak perfect English,
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.200]   by the level and the thickness of their accent.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.380]   That's why when you come when it's a young kid,
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.640]   you are able to get rid of the accent
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.140]   because you don't have a lot of things to replace.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.080]   Now I say all of this because it's true,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.040]   even with our view of Christ.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.680]   It's the false understanding, false hope
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.080]   that we hope in Christ is the biggest hindrance
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.040]   in knowing the true Christ of the Bible.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.600]   And so we have a tendency to continue to go to things
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.240]   and continue to hope for things
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.200]   that we have learned to embrace.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.760]   And so if you've grown up in the church,
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.600]   understanding a false understanding of Christ
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.320]   or an incomplete understanding of Christ,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.280]   even when you hear the truth, you filter it
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.260]   by what you think, what you've already placed
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.880]   in your own head.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.440]   And so you have theological accents that keep coming out.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.360]   No matter how much you hear the truth,
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.120]   you have a tendency to continue to keep it in that box.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.720]   See, when Christ showed up,
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.920]   they had all these people had different boxes
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.640]   that they wanted to put Christ
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.400]   and what they expected from him.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.520]   But Jesus riding on that donkey,
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.160]   being crucified on the cross,
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.360]   didn't fit any of their boxes.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.200]   And that's why even though he had every sign,
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.000]   he fulfilled over a hundred prophecies,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.920]   he raised somebody from the dead,
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.640]   but because he didn't fit the box,
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.160]   he couldn't be the Messiah.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.840]   And that's why they ended up crucifying him.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.280]   They wanted a Moses figure to come to deliver them
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.160]   from the bondage of Egypt.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.560]   They wanted somebody like Joshua to come
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.320]   and deliver them and restore them
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.440]   back into the promised land.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.920]   They wanted David to be restored
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.600]   so that they can bring back the glory of the kingdom.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.280]   They wanted Elijah to be powerful.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.840]   Until he came to Jerusalem,
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.200]   Jesus fit every part of that, at least in their mind.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.440]   Everything he did.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.160]   There's some odd things that he said
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.200]   that they couldn't fit.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.660]   So they kind of kept it on the side.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.680]   Even the disciple, they just go,
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.600]   "Oh, we heard that, but that doesn't make any sense.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.920]   "Maybe we just don't understand."
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.360]   And just kind of put it on the side.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.040]   But when he actually started to go to the cross,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.400]   they started realizing he doesn't fit.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:50.920]   So when the Jesus that you're confronted with
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.720]   doesn't fit the box that you have,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.420]   you are forced to make a decision.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.360]   Either the Jesus that's being presented to you
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.440]   is not the Jesus of the Bible,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.040]   or the Jesus that you think doesn't fit
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.640]   isn't the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.680]   It's one or the other.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.840]   But you cannot have both.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.560]   You cannot have the prejudices
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.800]   and the things and the traditions
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.640]   that you've grown up with.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.000]   And when you open up the scriptures and it doesn't fit,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.500]   and then you live with this tension
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.280]   where it's neither here nor there.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.240]   When Christ came into Jerusalem,
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.680]   he shattered their expectations.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.280]   And as much as people turned against LeBron James,
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.560]   because all their hopes were shattered when he left,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.280]   imagine the hatred that they had toward Christ
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.640]   when he disappointed them.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   Imagine how quickly they wanted to get rid of him,
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.480]   because they had so much hope.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.560]   And when they lost that hope,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.600]   as much as they were praising him,
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.960]   they were hating him instantaneously.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.120]   It's interesting that in the midst of this,
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.480]   knowing all of this,
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.400]   why did Jesus go through this week?
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.480]   He knew they were gonna reject him.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.600]   He knew what they were gonna do.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.200]   He was weeping because he understood
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.800]   that their celebration was a rejection of him.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.520]   The Bible says that he wept.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.360]   He wept.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:28.680]   Weeping happens because you care about something so much.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.320]   And you're saddened.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.400]   If you're indifferent, you don't cry.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.800]   You hear that there was some tragedy that happened,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.880]   you may feel saddened by it,
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.680]   but you're not gonna weep over that.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.120]   Because you're not connected to that.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.200]   You can hear about the Holocaust, that's really sad,
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.600]   but how many of you wept over the Holocaust?
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.320]   Because it's just history.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.440]   Horrendous history.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.240]   But it doesn't affect you personally.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.480]   Weeping happens because something really matters to you.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.040]   Because it affects you emotionally.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.600]   Our God is not an indifferent God
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.960]   who just set a bunch of rules and say,
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.880]   try to fulfill it, and if you don't fulfill it,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.720]   oh well.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.520]   Some of you I will give life,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.080]   and some of you will be judged.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:18.520]   In fact, in Exodus 34, five through eight,
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.160]   God introduces himself to the nation of Israel this way.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.600]   The Lord descended in the cloud and stood there with him
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.360]   as he called upon the name of the Lord.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   Then the Lord passed by in front of him
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.280]   and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God,
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.320]   compassionate, gracious, slow to anger,
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.160]   abounding in loving kindness and truth,
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.120]   who keeps loving kindness for thousands,
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.680]   who forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.000]   Now why does he say this?
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.640]   Because the nation of Israel already broke God's command.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.040]   Because Moses would not come down fast enough,
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.680]   they got impatient, and Aaron decides
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.280]   that he's going to make this golden calf.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.720]   He hears Yahweh, and they start worshiping him,
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.000]   God is angered, comes, and he divides the nation of Israel
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.240]   and those who are for him and against him.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.960]   And so he, after this happens,
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.440]   he chooses to give the commandment a second time.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.640]   So God had every reason to destroy them.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   We would think that after that event happened,
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.160]   wow, they couldn't even last a month
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.940]   after everything that God has done.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.120]   They rebel against him, he said,
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.600]   we're gonna worship this God.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.320]   So you would think that God would say
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.000]   enough of these rebellious people,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.040]   and he would walk away, but instead,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.600]   those who come to his side, he reminds them of who he is.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.000]   He is compassionate.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.520]   The reason why you are not consumed
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.200]   is because he is a compassionate, gracious, loving,
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.520]   patient God who is eager to forgive sins
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.800]   when sinners repent.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.720]   You know what's interesting about this word,
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.000]   compassion, here?
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.040]   In Hebrew, the word is rakum.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.160]   And the word rakum, the root word of rakum
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.040]   means the womb, the mother's womb.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.860]   Isn't that a great way to understand the word compassion?
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.200]   It's the mother's womb.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.600]   In fact, the greatest illustration of this
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.200]   is remember Solomon?
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.320]   You had these two young women
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.800]   who were claiming that that little baby was theirs
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.920]   and there was no way to prove this
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.400]   'cause one was saying that it was hers
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.060]   and then the other was saying that it was hers.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.260]   So Solomon, in his wisdom, says,
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.360]   "Pick up a sword and cut the baby in half."
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.640]   A horrendous thing to do.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   But the woman who was lying basically said,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.320]   "Well, if I can't have her, she can't have her either,
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.600]   "so cut the baby in half."
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.960]   And it was the real mother who steps in
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.740]   and said, "How can I allow my child to be cut in half
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.700]   "even if I can't have this child?
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.760]   "Give it to her."
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.260]   And Solomon knew.
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.280]   And what was his knowledge based upon?
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.640]   Her compassion toward that child.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.160]   The Bible describes God's compassion
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.300]   as a mother's compassion toward her child.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.900]   In Isaiah 49, 15 to 16,
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.080]   "Can a woman forget her nursing child
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.380]   "and have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:09.380]   "Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.680]   "Behold, I have inscribed you on the palm of my hand.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.920]   "Your walls are continually before me."
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.800]   God describes his love toward sinners,
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.520]   toward his people, as a mother's compassion
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.820]   toward her child, the womb.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.920]   Again in Matthew 23, 37, Jesus says,
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.820]   "Jerusalem, who kills the prophets
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.700]   "and stones those who are sent to her?
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.080]   "How often I wanted to gather your children together
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.180]   "the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.800]   "and you were unwilling."
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.240]   Again, even Jesus uses that idea of compassion,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.840]   the womb, to describe God's love toward us.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.760]   In fact, if you read the New Testament
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.080]   over and over and over again,
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.520]   what was the motivation behind everything that Jesus did?
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.840]   Matthew 15, 32, he said he had compassion on the 4,000,
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.440]   and that's why he fed them.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.360]   In Mark chapter 140 and 41,
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   he had compassion on the lepers.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.680]   Mark chapter five, one through 20,
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.960]   he had compassion on the demon-possessed man.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.080]   Luke chapter seven, he had compassion on the widow Nain.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.280]   Matthew 20, 30, 34, he had compassion
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.080]   on the two blind men.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.880]   And then in Luke chapter 15, 20,
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.400]   he had compassion on his prodigal son.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.320]   And I could just sit here for the next 15 minutes
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.280]   just read verse after verse after verse after verse.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.640]   The motivation behind what moved our Savior was compassion.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.440]   Why did Jesus do what he did?
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.960]   Today is the inauguration,
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.880]   it's this beginning of Christ's suffering.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.280]   That's why we call it the Passion Week.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.440]   The word passion, where we get the word,
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440]   basically in Latin it means to suffer.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.160]   So that's why we call this week Passion Week,
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.880]   and the beginning of it is Palm Sunday.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.360]   In the midst of all the celebration,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.220]   in the midst of a parade, Jesus was suffering.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.040]   Our understanding of the word passion
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.120]   basically means strong emotions.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.360]   But the reason why Jesus suffered
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.600]   is because he had strong emotions.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.440]   He was not indifferent toward us.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.480]   If he was indifferent toward us,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.880]   he wouldn't be weeping.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.340]   In fact, many of us, because we've been hurt,
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.280]   we've been wronged, maybe some of you guys feel like
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.760]   you've been betrayed by a friend,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.240]   and the older you get, the more resolved you are
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.600]   that you're not gonna care.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.400]   You're not gonna get involved in people's lives.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.680]   You can keep them at a distance,
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.880]   but I'm not going to make myself vulnerable.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   Because the moment that I care,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   I'm putting myself in a position where I can get hurt.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.760]   So our natural tendency is if you've been hurt,
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.560]   that you're gonna keep people at a distance,
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.800]   that you're gonna become stoic.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.280]   So you go through the motion,
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.880]   but nothing really bothers you
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.000]   because you've never fully engaged in anything,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.120]   at least emotionally.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.240]   And 'cause we don't wanna be vulnerable.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.880]   We don't wanna suffer, we don't wanna feel pain.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:21.200]   But Jesus was weeping because he engaged with sinners.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.680]   He didn't have to do that.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680]   He could've remained stoic.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.000]   In fact, if you read the Bible,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.880]   the greatest judgment of God is indifference,
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.700]   where he pleads, he pleads, he pleads.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.160]   And then when a sinner wouldn't repent,
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.060]   how does he describe the judgment?
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.160]   He releases them.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.720]   He gives them over.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.240]   Do what you want to do and just releases them.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.520]   Jesus weeps because he cares,
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.080]   because it affects him.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:02.800]   And he suffers because he has strong emotions.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.640]   The text that I read in Exodus chapter 34
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.720]   that we read is that Jesus is compassionate,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.200]   he's gracious, but at the middle of verse seven,
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.800]   this is what he says.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.260]   Who keeps loving kindness for thousands,
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.320]   who forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.080]   yet he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:27.920]   That second part of verse seven, it'd be easier.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.560]   It would make a better sermon if I didn't quote that.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.160]   I can just leave and say God is compassionate,
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.960]   he's loving, he's patient,
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.280]   and I know you guys have come into this room
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.840]   with guilt and shame, but Jesus forgives
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.160]   because he is patient and compassionate, and he loves us.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.560]   And if I ended it there, it'd be a great sermon.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.720]   To go back and say, oh my God, he loves me,
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.280]   loves me unconditionally, he loves me just the way I am.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.840]   And yet in verse, middle of verse seven,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.080]   yet he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.240]   visiting the iniquity of the fathers and the children
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.580]   and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generation.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.600]   As much as he is gracious to the third
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.640]   and fourth generation for thousands of years,
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.840]   he says he will punish the sin
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.520]   for fourth and third and fourth generation.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.800]   He is equally passionate about dealing with sin.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.000]   How do you reconcile this?
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.720]   How does a God who is this gracious,
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.520]   who is this merciful, who is this patient,
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.700]   is also this vengeful, this harsh?
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.440]   How do you reconcile this tension?
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.000]   If you were a faithful Jew following the commands,
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.600]   following the prophecies, following the history of Israel,
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.640]   you would have ended the book of Malachi
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.980]   with that same tension.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.740]   He said that we're under a curse,
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.040]   and this curse has been adding up
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.960]   for generation to generation to generation,
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.200]   and yet prophecies are filled
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.240]   with hope of the Messiah that is coming.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.240]   (pages rustling)
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:10.480]   This is what he does to prepare himself to go to the cross.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.780]   The tension is finally released,
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.160]   and it is solved at the cross.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.320]   Because he said he will not leave the guilty on,
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.880]   in other words, he's not going to sweep under the rug sin,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.960]   and yet you and I are still here.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.660]   You and I are here to be able to celebrate,
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.900]   to sing, to come to church, to have hope in Christ.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.740]   Have you been punished for your sins?
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.700]   Have you paid the price for your sins,
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.120]   just as he said that it was gonna happen?
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.500]   Will your children suffer for the sins
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.200]   that you've committed and your parents have committed?
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.060]   Obviously not.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.860]   We're here because he suffered on our behalf.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.820]   He took upon himself what you and I deserve,
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:05.260]   and so he deliberately, passionately,
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.420]   took the steps to get to the cross
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.020]   so that you and I would have life
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.940]   and have this life abundantly.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:17.860]   As we celebrate this week,
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.660]   as we remember what Christ has done,
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.380]   my prayer is that we don't just walk through this thing
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.260]   and say, oh, historically, this is what happened,
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.100]   and then talk about it like we're talking
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.420]   about the Holocaust or talking about some history
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.580]   or something, some shooting that happened in Nashville,
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.860]   horrendous as it is, but this is for us.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.920]   It was whipped for us, for me, for you.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:48.260]   There's one thing that Jesus commanded his disciples to do
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:52.180]   that on the surface, they say,
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.980]   well, how do you practice that?
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.540]   Remember what Jesus said?
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.980]   If somebody slaps you, remember what he told us to do?
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:02.340]   Turn the other cheek.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.500]   How many of you have actually ever done that?
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.040]   Turn the other cheek.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.500]   Some of you may be deluded.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.560]   I've never seen it.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.620]   I've never seen it.
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.000]   So is it just a hyperbole?
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.940]   Jesus is just putting high standards
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.540]   that no one's gonna practice and say,
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.440]   well, to make you feel guilty?
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.360]   Right, if you wanna go into that door,
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.760]   you need to be, your righteousness needs to,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.440]   so what I'm telling you, you can't do,
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.520]   that's why Jesus did it.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.320]   Is that what he's saying, or does he actually expect us
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.160]   to turn the other cheek?
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.560]   If you look at the context carefully,
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.320]   Jesus actually is expecting us to turn the other cheek.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.400]   I know probably every single one of us,
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.680]   if we're honest, will say, well, we've never seen that.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.940]   At best, right, if somebody slaps you,
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.260]   we try not to kill them, right?
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.840]   Because our natural tendency is retribution,
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.920]   not equal justice.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.040]   Our natural tendency is vengeance.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.800]   So he said, leave room for the vengeance of God,
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.720]   because he knows our tendency is to take vengeance
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.280]   against anybody who goes against us, right?
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.000]   That's human, and we see that.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.540]   So if you don't take vengeance, you're a righteous man.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.980]   But turn the other cheek?
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:23.200]   Turn the other cheek to give yourself the other side
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.240]   so they can hurt you, too?
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.800]   That's dumb, that's foolish, why would you do that?
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.620]   But I think all of you will agree with me.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.600]   We've all, to some degree, have seen it and experienced it.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:43.000]   If you are a parent of teenagers or older,
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   you've experienced it, right?
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.960]   And they say some hurtful, mean things, right?
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.080]   People that literally will give their life to care for you,
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   and when they get angry and they don't get what they want,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.840]   all kinds of foul things come out of their mouth,
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.120]   and they hit you on your cheek.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.740]   And if you don't turn the other cheek, they will die.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.880]   'Cause they're homeless.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.100]   If you strike your parents and they choose
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.620]   not to turn the other cheek, you're homeless.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.700]   You're gonna starve to death.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.480]   You can't go to school, you can't pay for your bills,
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.320]   you're homeless.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.720]   It's because somebody in your life turned the other cheek
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.240]   when you were being a jerk.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.260]   You got here.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.700]   You did it.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.760]   If you don't have kids, you did it to your parents.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.560]   We did it, every single one of us.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.180]   Because our parents loved us the way God loves us.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:49.880]   And if we didn't love us that way, we wouldn't be here.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.740]   The only reason why we are here
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.500]   is because Jesus wept for us.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:01.540]   He chose to suffer for us.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:05.020]   He chose to care for us.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.660]   That's why he came into Jerusalem.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.940]   That's why he cleansed the temple.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.620]   That's why he gave the Olivet Discourse.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.940]   That's why he allowed himself to be betrayed.
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.680]   That's why he waited to participate in the Passover meal.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.720]   That's why he allowed himself to be arrested.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.480]   That's why he allowed himself to be crucified
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.040]   so that he may resurrect and give us life
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.540]   and give this life abundantly.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.680]   I pray that as we remember and celebrate
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.020]   the suffering of Christ this week,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.320]   that it would become as personal to you as possible.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.880]   That we're not simply celebrating theology or history.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.380]   We're celebrating our own lives
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.760]   through the suffering of Christ.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.600]   Let's pray.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:04.240]   Again, as our worship team comes to lead us,
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.600]   to take some time to pray.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   To pray even today
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.760]   that God would begin to soften our hearts.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.880]   That each day that we remember the suffering of Christ,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.480]   that we would be impacted that he did this for me.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:28.360]   And so when we come to the communion table on Friday,
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.440]   there's not just some religious thing that we're doing,
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.960]   but we really are coming,
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.760]   thanking him for what he has done.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.920]   And so when we come to celebrate on Sunday,
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.040]   that we really would be celebrating with all our heart.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.240]   Let's take some time to pray again
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.680]   as our worship team leads us.
