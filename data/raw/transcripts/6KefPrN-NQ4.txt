[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   - Okay, good morning, everyone.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   A few announcements.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   This Friday, we're going to be having our New Year's service
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   from 11 o'clock and on.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   And so before that, we'll also be opening up,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   I think, the cafe area at eight o'clock
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   if people want to come and spend some time with each other.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   So please come and join us for this service.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Membership class sign-ups are also going on,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   which will begin on January 16th.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   So please sign up and contact me if you have any questions
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   concerning that.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320]   And at First Peter Bible Study, sign-ups are also going on.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   That's gonna begin January 19th.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   So these are important.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   Please sign up earlier than later
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   as we begin to set up and prepare
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.320]   for these groups earlier on.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   And that would be a good thing also
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   if you find some newcomers around you
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   or people who are looking to see what's going on at church
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   to point them to some of these things.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   Next, our members meeting is on January 16th at 2.30 p.m.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   Please mark 2.30.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   I know sometimes we get confused with two.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   So it's 2.30 p.m.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   And that's gonna be on January 16th for all our members.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   Lastly, as we go into a time of offering,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   we are gonna be having a special offering today
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   for Lottie Moon, which is part of the IMB.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   That's how we support some of the local missionaries
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   that are all around the world.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   And please mark on your checks
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   that this is for the Lottie Moon offering
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   so that our finance team will understand
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   how to divide those things up.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   Our offering basket is in the back there,
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   and also electronically, the instructions are on the slides.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   Let me pray for our offering.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   Heavenly Father, thank you.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   Thank you that you are the giver of all the gifts that we have.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   We thank you, God, that at the end,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   that our lives belong to you.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   I pray that you give us an appropriate heart of worship
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   as we give to you the things that you have already given to us.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   Lord, help us that we might give with all our hearts,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   love, our desire for your kingdom.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Okay. Well, hello again everyone.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   This is the last Sunday of the year.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   And, uh, just kind of, there's nothing left now.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   Now that Christmas is done, we kind of start to look forward to New Year's Eve.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   So again, please join us this Friday as we reflect back on this past year and pray together.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   And also look forward to the coming year, as it will be a good time to do that.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   And, uh, what I wanted to talk about today, after some meditation and contemplation on my end,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   is to talk about fear.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   And it's because I actually gave the last Sunday sermon last year too.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   And then I looked back at it and I realized, man, like the landscape,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   I don't know, the landscape hasn't changed all that much.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   And just looking and seeing and thinking about a good topic to think about
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   and to kind of think together about as we end this year is on this topic of fear.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   So we're going to be camping on this.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   I'm going to read out a list for you of things we might fear,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   because a lot of the work is going to be done in you as you listen.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   Because I'm going to be talking about fear, but these fears need to be applied directly to us.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   And so we all come with very different fears.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Let me list a few.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   We have fear of people, fear of the unknown, fear of circumstances, fear of loneliness,
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   fear of losing reputation, respect, fear of purposelessness, fear of pain, fear of rejection, just to name a few.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   And the reason why I want to think about this is because fear is something that drives all of us, bar none.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   Every single one of us, fear will drive us.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   Whether you realize it or not, whether you understand that it's happening or not,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   fear is a driving force in all of us.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   It's something that's been happening in us all our lives, the last few years, the last few months, even the last few hours.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   Fear drives us.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   Wherever we have dreams, desires, hopes, or aspirations, there you're going to find fear.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   Fear is everywhere.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   Fear of the unknown, therefore, many times it's because we're afraid of our hopes being dashed,
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   of our dreams and aspirations not coming into fruition.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   Fear is central in our decision making.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   Fear is central in our conviction, in our resolve.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   And fear, many times, because it's so consuming, is going to cause us to want to be rid of fear.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   But today, because fear has been such a great talking point over the last year, over the last couple years,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   today I want to take us down a very singular path,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   which is that we are not supposed to do away with fear.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   And we were never meant to do away with fear.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   We were never meant to bring peace into our hearts by trying to overcome these fears that we see around us.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   In fact, the only way we're to overcome those things is to appropriately place our fear.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   And so that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   What it is to fear God, because this is not a new and unique idea for us.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   So, before we start, would you pray with me?
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   God, as we go into your word, I pray that we would hear, listen, obey, and understand.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Father, help us to come before you.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   And Lord, maybe today, even to say not just before your word,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   but before your word, God, that this is not a text removed from your very presence, from your very person.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   Help us to respond, not because we're at church listening to a sermon.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   Help us to hear your voice.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   We'll do five, five points today.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.320]   So we're going to kind of go through as fast as we can.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   The first one, the first point, is that fear is completely wrapped up in what we worship.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   So we're going to equate the two things today, fear and worship.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   Fear is completely wrapped up in worship.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Whatever it is that we deem to be the most important things in our lives, you will find fear there.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   We fear that the object of our worship will be taken away from us.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   That's a very common experience for all of us.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   And we see people doing crazy things because of the object of worship being threatened.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   People do crazy things in order to protect and to retain the object.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   There are lots of different things.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   One example could be a romantic relationship.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   I've seen people who are like somewhat mature in their faith,
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   and when it comes to this romantic sphere, all of a sudden it seems like because of some kind of fear there,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   they've done some crazy things.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   What did you say?
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   What did you do?
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   Why did you do that?
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   Why did you move like that?
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   Why did you make the decisions that you did?
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   Because fears very much drive us as objects of worship come front and center.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   You see it in desire to uphold personal reputation, in the desire for prestige, comfort,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   some kind of title in our careers.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   Another place that's interesting is when you see yourself angry.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   Many times anger will reveal places of fear.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   We can't go into that one.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   But it's an interesting thing.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   We also fear that the power, we fear the power that the object of worship has over us.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   It can be an unhealthy fear and the wrath that can be poured out upon us.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   We fear that we might disappoint.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   This is one of the main reasons why we fear men.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   We fear people.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   We fear what people think about us.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   Even for people who pride themselves in saying, "I don't care what people think about me,"
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   you get close enough to their inner circles, to the people that they care about,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   and there you will find many fears.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   Fear is completely wrapped up in what we worship.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   I want to make that link very clear today.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   Fear, worship.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   Where you see your greatest fears, there you will find your greatest places of worship.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   Therefore, that's where you'll find the greatest places of idolatry in your life.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   That's why generally we have this idea floating around in us of fearfulness.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   When we fear things, we know we're not supposed to fear the things of this world,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   what can be done to us, the losses that we might face, all that.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   We know singularly we're supposed to fear God and God alone.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   These are easy concepts for us,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   but we can see the great divide in the way we see things and understand things.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   We all know this.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   It's because God might not be the object of our worship.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.320]   When we fear God, we don't fear anything else because we fear him.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   The fear of God is actually our foundation.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   The fear of God is the beginning point of everything we know,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   of everything we're supposed to be seeing.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.320]   The fear of God is central point, is the hinge.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   In Proverbs 1, verse 7, it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge."
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   Now I want to highlight for you beginning.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   It doesn't say it is like a pinnacle or it doesn't say that it's great knowledge.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   If you have a fear of God, it leads to great knowledge or greater knowledge.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   It says it is the beginning.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   It is the starting point.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   There's no shortcuts to this.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   You can't get to this idea of knowledge,
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   you can't get to it unless you go through that door of fear of God.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   That's what this is saying.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   Proverbs 9, 10, it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   This means that if our decisions and sight do not begin with the fear of the Lord,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   there is no correct knowledge, there is no correct wisdom.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   These passages aren't saying that the fear of the Lord is just a good thing,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   something to work on.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   Again, look at it again.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   Beginning is a foundation.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:46.320]   Unless we see and think and start to have a worldview
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.320]   that is going through the fear of God,
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   we're going to be on precarious ground.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   That's why when the winds and waves come in this world,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   when the things of our greatest fears come into fruition,
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   what happens to us?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   We fall. Why?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   Because it depends on where our fears are.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   It says here that the fear of God is that foundation.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   There is no middle ground.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   Because we were all made to be worshippers,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   we were all made to be fearers.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   We know that if we're not worshipping God, we're worshipping something else.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   Again, common thought.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   But that also means if we're not fearing God, we're fearing something else.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   There is no middle ground.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I want to focus in the book of Luke to see this in action today.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   People are encountering Jesus.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   It came to my thought in Christmas season,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   actually because last year I looked through it,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   and there was one phrase I found interesting.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   It was Mary's prayer of worship to God.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   In that worship, she says that God's mercy is upon those who fear him.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   It's a very common--it's an inductive question you could easily ask.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   Why fear?
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   You could do that with mercy too.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   I chose to think about the fear part.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Why fear?
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Why is it like that God's mercy is upon those who love God,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   who follow God, who trust in God?
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   Why fear?
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   Through that fascination, I started a word study through the book of Luke.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   That brings us to our second point here.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   In the book of Luke, what we see is that there is a common response to Jesus,
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   and that was fear.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   A common response to Jesus was fear.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   Now, be careful.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   This makes too much sense to us.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   Of course, there ought to be some semblance of fear.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   But this is where I'm asking you, please, don't jump the gap.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   When you see this great divide between, "I know I ought to fear the Lord,"
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   and then how we're actually living, don't jump that too quick.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   If this becomes a theological exercise of looking at Jesus and saying,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   "Yeah, they're following before Jesus," makes sense,
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   without stopping and seeing what's going on,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   it's going to leave us in a dangerous place.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   And what I saw as I was going through the book of Luke is that person after person
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   in Calvary, Jesus was afraid.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   Very weird.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.320]   Again, kind of makes sense on my understanding level.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   But when I start to sit there and think, how would I have responded?
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   When Jesus is doing crazy things, when he's doing these miracles,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   when this net comes up with wiggling fish and is threatening to break,
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   how I think I would have responded, this is just what I think, right?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   I don't know if my first thing would have been fear.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   If I'm trying to place myself there, I think my first thing would have been
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   some kind of exuberance.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Like, "Whoa, dude!"
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   I think a smile would have been brought to my face.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   I would have been like, "Dude, I'm going with this guy.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   This man, I'm going to follow him."
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   And I might have done the same thing.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   I would have left everything to follow this man.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   But it would have been like, "Gee!"
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   It would have been this response of joy, of happiness, something like that.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   But here, the passages that I saw was fear.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   That was like the immediate response.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   Okay, let's go through it.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.320]   In the beginning, when Jesus is being talked about, it made more sense.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.320]   So in Luke 1:12, it says, "Zechariah was troubled when he saw the angel,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   and fear gripped him."
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.320]   Okay, so here's an angel of light, and that makes sense.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.320]   That's kind of scary.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   And then in Luke 1:65, it says, "Zechariah opening his mouth,
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   fear came on all those living around them,
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea."
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   Now remember, Gabriel was--you can think of him as like a pointer, right?
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   He's pointing to the coming Christ.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   And so, well, the person who points to someone that's coming
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   is supposed to be lesser than the one that's coming.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   But there's appropriate fear that is given upon this angel
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   who is pointing to the coming of Jesus.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   And then Jesus comes into the picture,
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   and then in Luke 5:8-10, it's a story of Simon Peter.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   Jesus tells--remember, he's a carpenter--
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   tells a seasoned fisherman, along with a couple other seasoned fishermen,
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   what to do in the water in order to catch fish.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   And they listen, and this net comes up full of wiggling fish,
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   and look at what happens as a response, Luke 5:8.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   "But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus' feet."
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   Now, listen to his words.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   This was his first and immediate reaction.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   I think this is, like, all he felt.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   You know, when you look at it, look at it.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   He says, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   "For amazement," I love this word, "had seized him and all his companions
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   because of the catch of fish which they had taken.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   And so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon."
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   Look at that word "because."
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   Because of the fish they had caught, why would fear happen?
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   Why not exuberance and joy and happiness and excitement?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   Why does he fall down?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   What we're seeing here is the difference between knowing, right?
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   Like, maybe he was like, "This is the Messiah."
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   Maybe something like that was going on in his mind, right?
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   It's all in here.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   But this is what happens when you experience it, when you're in the presence.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   Luke 5:26, "Jesus and the paralytic."
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   Remember, this is a paralyzed man.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   And all of a sudden, he's walking.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   How would you have responded in that situation?
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   There's a paralyzed man here.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   Jesus comes and says, "Walk," and he gets up and he walks.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   What would your response have been?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   But look at Luke 5:26, "They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God,
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   and they were filled."
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   It doesn't say they were fearful.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   They were filled with fear, afraid, scared.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   We have seen remarkable things today.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   Luke 7:16, "Jesus heals the centurion's servant.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   Fear gripped them, and they began glorifying God, saying, 'A great prophet has risen among us,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.320]   and God has visited his people.'
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   When Jesus calms the storm," Luke 8:25, "and he said to them, 'Where is your faith?'
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, 'Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water,
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   and they obey him?'"
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   Jesus and the demoniac, Luke 8:35, "The people went out to see what had happened,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   and they had came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they became frightened."
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   This is my favorite one, because you would think that someone is afraid of a demon-possessed man.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   If you came across a demon-possessed man, think of the fear.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   These people are afraid because the demon-possessed man became normal.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   Do you see that?
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   They're filled with fear because he's thinking and talking properly.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   He's clothed.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   It's not like, "What happened to him?"
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   It's not like, "Whoa, Jesus!"
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   It's fear.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   In Luke 8:37, to conclude that story, "And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   and the surrounding district asked him to leave.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   They were so afraid to ask him to leave, for they were gripped with great fear."
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   There's a lot of big language going on there.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   "Gripped with great fear, they got into a boat, and he returned."
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   Jesus and the bleeding woman, Luke 8:47.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   "When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before him
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   and declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched them
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   and how she had been immediately healed.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   When Jesus resurrects the little girl," Luke 8:56, "her parents were amazed."
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   By the way, this word "amazed" has a type of fear imbued into it.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   "But he instructed them to tell no one what had happened."
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   Jesus and the transfiguration, Luke 9:34.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   "While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them,
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   and the three, they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   And Jesus appears after the resurrection," Luke 24, 37,
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   "but they were startled and frightened and thought they were seeing a spirit."
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   Now, regardless of the story here, this was just a cursory read through the book of Luke.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   The immediate response was fear.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   It was like, "Why didn't I not see this?"
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.320]   Everybody.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   See, fear is natural to the human.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   We were made to be fearers.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   As much as we were all created to worship, it goes hand in hand with fear.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   Fear is an appropriate response for every human being.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   That's what we do.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   Now, we just saw encounters with Jesus, but that's what we do as human.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   We fear things.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   Today, we've grown much too casual with the Lord.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   We say we want to glorify God.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   We want God to be glorified.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   We say we are worshipers of God.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   And we're proud Bereans here.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   And we say our vision is engaging in God-centered worship.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   But there is danger here.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   If we say this casually, flippantly, when there is actually no fear in us of God,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   it shows something about us.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   When we have no fear of the Lord in us, we have to question if we actually currently believe what we're saying.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   We have to wonder about the quality of our worship.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   We have to think, "Do I actually believe these things about God?"
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   Because if we're not careful, then we are going to fall simply into Christian ways of living,
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   habitually drawing out our action based upon Christian moralism,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   and trying to follow sets of rules that we've established,
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   and be able to say the right things with our mouth that we are worshipers of God,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   who engage in God-centered worship, that we have a high view of God,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   and then the way we live does not reflect it.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   It's a theological concept to me.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   Is the experience there for every one of us?
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   Albert Martin says, "One of the accurate measurements of true spiritual growth
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   is the measure to which one increases in walking in the fear of God."
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Let's take one example from Hebrews 4.16.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   Hebrews 4.16 says, "Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.320]   We know this passage.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   One of my favorite passages.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   But I want us to take a look at it to show how quickly we move to just this understanding that we have
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   instead of experience.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   This is so challenging to me.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   When you look at this passage, what's the word that we highlight almost every time?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   I think--if I'm wrong, sorry--I think it's confidence.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   That's what I kind of think.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   Approach the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.320]   And here's the problem with that.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:51.320]   Why is he telling you to approach the throne of grace with confidence?
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.320]   Because you're approaching the throne.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   Right?
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   So the reason why he's telling us to approach the throne of grace with confidence
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   is because the reaction ought to be foundationally fearful.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   Now, people use this image of like a child who's in the president's office.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   And then he strolls in comfortably.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   Why?
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   Because the president is his father.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   You might have heard that image before.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.320]   I think it's true and it's a good image.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:27.320]   But not without the appropriateness of the foundation that ought to be set.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.320]   That we run to this confidence word.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   That we can go up to this God without realizing the weight of what it's saying.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   He's saying, "You're going to God."
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   How can he say, "Approach him confidently."
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   Like ever.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   Right?
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   Like, isn't it kind of weird?
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:02.320]   He's saying, "Approach the throne of grace in confidence to find help in your time of need."
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.320]   Because what the author of Hebrews is saying is the foundation is fear.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   It's understood.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   This is not just a worldly throne even.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   This is the king of the universe.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   And he says, "Approach the throne."
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   What amazing capacity we humans have to decrease the Lord.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.320]   Right?
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.320]   What amazing is the human capacity when John the Baptist has to say something like,
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.320]   "He must increase and I must decrease."
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   And we're challenged by it.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   How sad that we're challenged by that statement.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   "He must increase and I must decrease."
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.320]   Oh, man.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   That's so challenging to me.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   And it's so sad that I'm challenged by that.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   How does one even increase God?
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.320]   And last week, Pastor Peter, he showed the magnitude of God by scrolling out.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   Right?
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   That we're this minute little person.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   That we're a speck even when it comes to like just an aerial perspective of our state of California.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   And you zoom out to country and to planet.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   And you keep going on and you realize, man, the planet to the sun, the sun to the stars.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   And the stars, there's so many of these stars in this galaxy, in the single letter billions of galaxies.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   And you kind of go out and out and out.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   And you realize that the Bible says that God holds the universe in his hands.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   Right?
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   He's huge.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   We should just stop talking because there's no way our words can communicate the grandeur,
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   the magnificence, the hugeness, the immensity of our God.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   There's no way.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   So we just say he's huge.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   And for John the Baptist to say he must increase is an absurdity.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   The concept is not crazy.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   Because we get it.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   But it happens because we've somehow lost sight of God's actual magnitude.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   He does not need to be magnified.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   He is who he is.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   His magnitude is a reality.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   It's a truth that never changes.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   It's a staggering reality.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   His magnitude is incomprehensible.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.320]   We're the problem.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   And not only does he say he must increase, what else does he say?
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   Oh, man, we're such fools, right?
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.320]   He says you must decrease.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   Why does he say you have to decrease?
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   Because we're so big in our own eyes.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   We look at this image of the suns and the stars, and we know right in here, I'm small.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   I'm infinitesimally small.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   I'm a speck.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   God is huge.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   God is big.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.320]   God is everything.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   He is God alone all in here.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   That's why we need to coach yourself and convince yourself on these very seats
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   before we sing these worship songs to this great God to say, remember, remember,
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:35.320]   we have to pull ourselves, remember reverence, remember awe, remember worship.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:41.320]   Because he somehow decreased, and somehow I have increased.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   What an absurdity.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   The reason why John the Baptist says this is because, do you know why?
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.320]   Because I'm dumb.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   It's because I'm blind.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   Because I don't understand.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   I'm a fool.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.320]   I have no fear of God in me.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   I have no grasp and understanding of present-day reality.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   We wake up every morning thinking, I'm God.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.320]   The world revolves around me.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   It's my wishes, my desires, which is all that matters.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   When someone wrongs me, I will retaliate.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   When something doesn't go my way, I will complain.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   When troubles come, I will blame others and even God himself.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   And that's because we fear the things of the world.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   And when the things of the world threaten us, guess what?
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   We think we're God, but in reality, we realize we have no power of God.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   And so when things threaten us, what happens?
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   The fear of these things begins to shake us.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.320]   Because these things--I'm so afraid to lose these things.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   Because it's going against what I've created to be my kingdom.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   It's going against my desires, my wishes, my aspirations, my hopes,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   whatever it is that my plans are, that those things I've set up,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   and they have become idols in my life.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   We can't sit there and mentally convince ourselves that God is someone to be feared
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   because we already know it.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   Isn't true fear something that needs to be experienced?
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.320]   I'm very afraid of heights.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   I hate the feeling of heights.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   I go up--I don't care how high it is, anything past two stories,
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.320]   I start getting really--it makes my legs feel like jello.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.320]   I don't like what it does.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   It makes my stomach feel a little queasy.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   I don't like heights.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.320]   So whenever I go up into heights places, I just pretend that's not there.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   And that's how I overcome my fear of heights.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   The weird thing about people who fear things, you like thinking about it.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.320]   You like imagining things.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   So what I like to do--actually, my wife thinks I'm so odd for doing this,
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   but I like YouTube videos of heights.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:06.320]   So people go up to these high places and look down and look at it and go, "Ahh!"
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   I do that, right?
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   Like, "Ahh! Please, get away from that ledge."
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   I don't care how many inches of plastic there is there, get off.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.320]   Clip yourself onto something.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   I mean, it's just there.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   But do you know what I look like?
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   If my wife were to explain to you what I look like at that place,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   I would probably have a smile on my face going like--
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   But okay, here's the difference.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.320]   With just thinking, contemplating, meditating on fear,
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   and me actually going to a place where I'm like thousands of feet up--
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   I can't do things. Is that a thing?
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   Thousands of feet up in the air, and I'm looking down,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   and that fear that grips me, that reality that I see before me,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   you know what happens? There is no smile.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   There is no thrill.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   There is only fear.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   I'm terrified.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   All I can think about is, "Get me away."
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.320]   Right? Do you guys know what I'm saying?
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.320]   The difference between this and then when you're there,
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.320]   when you experience something.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   For every parent, every parent--
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.320]   This happened at the OC fair a while back.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   One of the parents lost her kids.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.320]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, how could you lose your kids?"
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.320]   And I turn around, we lost our kids.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   And so I'm sitting there thinking about this,
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   and there's differences because as a parent of three young kids,
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   we've all done it, right?
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.320]   What would we do if this happened?
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   But whatever the case, that feeling of fear--
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.320]   You know, you watch these movies where the kid disappears,
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   you're like, "It catches your breath."
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   But that moment when we couldn't find our child,
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   even though it was a split, like maybe it was 20 or 30 seconds,
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   that moment, sheer terror.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   Just panic.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.320]   Like I do not know what to do.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.320]   Inside, it was like, "Slow down. Okay, this is what you got to do."
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   But the feeling was gripping.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   The experience was just something.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   And I think we understand this.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   We get it when we feel these things.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   Our fears are going to reveal something about us.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   It's going to reveal the greatest places of worship in us.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:43.320]   And it's going to be many times, honestly, experiential.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   So my question to you is,
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   have you been cultivating a fear of the Lord?
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.320]   There's no shortcut in this.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:55.320]   There's no way for you to say, like, "I have to fear God more."
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   That was what was happening to these people that we saw in Luke.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.320]   It was experiential.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   They're coming across Christ,
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   and then in His presence, experience happens.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   That's why they fall.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   Do you understand why the experience is so important in this?
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   When we think of the things we fear in the world,
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   again, they could be bodily harm or death,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   loss of financial security, loss of relationships,
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   disapproval of man, loss of reputation,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.320]   having our aspirations ripped away from us,
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   drawing near to the Lord, walking with Him,
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   seeing Him ought to cast off all other fears.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   You understand that?
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   As our fear of Him grows, a rightly high and view of God,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   as that grows in us, it's going to transform our hearts in this.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   For Simon Peter, it caused him to turn his back on his entire career.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   For James and John, it left their father
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   and a lucrative business in a boat behind.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   For Matthew, the tax collector, he left behind his identity,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   his friends, his riches, his security,
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   everything that he knew, he left everything behind.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   For all of these disciples, it left behind fear of the loss of these things.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   Now, here's my question. Why?
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.320]   Because they weren't afraid?
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   Can I tell you? No.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   I don't think it was that fears that went away.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.320]   Here. I think they were still afraid.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   You know, most of the original apostles, they were martyred.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   They were executed.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   Do you think that they were without fear the night before they died?
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   You know, I think about it, and I think, no, I think they were afraid.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   It's scary.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.320]   But what happened to them?
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Well, in a place where we're all called to be fearers,
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   a greater fear consumed them.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   The greatest and only logical object of worship
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   replaced their entire viewfinder.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   Their sight got completely saturated with God.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   It changed their entire paradigm for that reason.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   It was a fear so powerful that it obliterated all of their fears.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.320]   It changed their dreams, even.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   What a powerful fear.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   It changed their dreams, their aspirations, their hopes, and their desires.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   It led most of them to death.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:46.320]   What fears today have been overcoming your fear of the Lord?
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   Are we people who have been cultivating a fear of the Lord
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   that overcomes all other fears?
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.320]   Now, the third point today is that in the book of Luke,
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   Jesus commands them not to fear.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   I thought this was really funny as I was thinking about this.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   Because our second point was that the response,
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   the common response to Jesus is to fear.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   So in the book of Luke, you're like, "Man, I need to fear God."
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   But over and over again, in the middle of it,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   the things that's all interspersed is, "Do not fear. Do not fear. Do not fear."
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.320]   I'm like, "You're jerking me around here.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   Am I to fear, or am I to not fear?"
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   And then I realized, if I'm not careful with this,
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   I will choose what I want, when I want in my life.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   So I know I'm supposed to fear, so I'll try to develop a fear.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   And then when I feel afraid of these things, I'll try not to fear.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   And then there's the disconnect that can happen there.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   But let's look. In the book of Luke, there's a command over and over again.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.320]   Luke 1:13, "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah,
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.320]   and you will give him the name John.'
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   And then later on, in Luke 1.30, "The angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   for you have found favor with God.'"
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:58.320]   And then in Zechariah's prophecy, Luke 1.74,
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   "To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   might serve him without fear."
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.320]   The angels come to the shepherds and says,
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   "This is scary. A bunch of angels come."
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news."
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.320]   And Luke 5.10, this is the story with Simon Peter and the fish in the net.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   Jesus says, Simon's scared.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear. From now on, you will be catching men."
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.320]   In Luke 12.4, he says, "I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body,
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   and after that have no more that they can do."
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   The fear is essential before comfort can come.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   Before God's peace is offered to us, there is actually fear in us.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.320]   So this is what it means.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   Fear of God will lead us to a place where he says, "Do not fear,"
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   which is going to lead us into a place of comfort.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.320]   That's how it works in every situation.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   Fear of God, he says, "Don't be afraid."
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   And then peace and comfort comes.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.320]   Now what we do, because of the disconnect, because we know things,
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   because we know about who God is,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   so we're able to say, "Sovereign, good, omnipotent, omniscient."
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.320]   We know these things, right?
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   So we say to each other, "Trust God, trust God, trust God."
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   Convince ourselves, "Trust God, trust God," without the experience.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.320]   And we lose it.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   So this is what we do.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   We come to places where we fear, because we're fearers.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   We fear so many things.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   And we come to these little junctions or these crossroads,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   and with the fear, we want peace.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   That's natural.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320]   We want comfort.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.320]   And so we go to God's word, and we try to take.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   And we try to go like, "Ngh," to our minds.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   Do you know what two of the passages that I have most readily memorized in my brain is?
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   Proverbs--okay, so when we think about these passages that we remember in our brain,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   like, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   Do not lean on your own understanding."
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.320]   We kind of go, and we say these things over and over and over again in our minds.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   "Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication."
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   It's because we desire the peace of God to come and envelop us, right?
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   Is that not what we do?
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.320]   We go to God, and we go to his word because we want the peace.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   We want the peace in pill form.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   We want that thing to be zapped into us.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   And we pray to our peers, and we say to our peers, "Please pray for me.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.320]   Pray that I'll have God's peace."
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   And we do whatever we can to get it.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.320]   And there are certain prayer requests that drive me crazy.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   Like when we say, "Pray that I won't be lazy."
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.320]   It just makes no sense to me.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.320]   Sometimes I go like, "Okay, I'll pray for you."
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   But in my mind, I'm thinking, "Don't be lazy."
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   In a similar way, people say, "Please pray that God's peace will be with me."
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   Like, "Don't worry. I'm not judging you as you're saying that.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   It's a good prayer."
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   But there is something about it in my mind.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.320]   I think like, "But are you walking with the Lord?"
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.320]   Because we all want that peace and comfort.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   There's difficulties that come, fears that we face.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   And we want those things, and we want to jam it into us with no experience of God.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.320]   There is no encounter with Him.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.320]   There is no everyday walking with Him.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.320]   There's no abiding with Him.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   There's no desire to be in His presence.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   We only want the effects of what God could give us.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.320]   And so what we do is, we have all this knowledge of who God is.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   So even the right theology, misapplied, is going to be because we are not effectively walking with Him.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.320]   And so knowledge of who God is and the truths that come out of that
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.320]   will not apply to you no matter how much you think about it.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   Unless you know Him, and you're walking with Him because you see Him.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   How can you tell someone not to be afraid?
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.320]   How cruel.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   What sad counseling.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   Until what?
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   Until this great reality comes.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:24.320]   Until the eyes are like, "See!"
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   It's really interesting as parents of younger children.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.320]   My kids are six, two, and four. They're very young.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   So they all have different places of understanding.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   One of the things that's very interesting about this command not to fear
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   is that you can't tell someone to not be afraid unless they're afraid.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   You guys know what I mean?
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   So as a parent, here's what I've seen.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   There's things that happen very commonplace in young kids' homes.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   And one of those things is, you're doing something.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   You're doing the dishes, or cleaning, or trying to get things done.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.320]   And then you hear a "clap" in the other room.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.320]   As a parent, you just know.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   Next thing you do is, your ears just perk up and listen for the next thing.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   Because the next sound that comes is going to tell you what happened.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   So if there's laughter, you're like, "Oh, okay. Someone did something funny."
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   But if there's the shrill cry--
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   and every parent of a young child knows it--
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.320]   the shrill cry that comes of a child who is just telling the universe that they've been wronged.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   And you walk into this room,
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   and then there's one child on the ground writhing in pain, acting like they got shot.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.320]   And then there's this other child just sitting there like a sociopath,
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   just staring with no feeling in his face.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   You're like, "What happened?"
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.320]   First of all, it's like, to my daughter, I'm like, "Stop being dramatic."
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.320]   Now you can see the dynamics in my home.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   To my oldest daughter, "Stop being dramatic."
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.320]   So I've got to have the conversation, but my other kid's just staring.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   I'm like, "What is going on? Say something. Say sorry. Go to them.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   Do you not see them screaming in pain?
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   What is going on with you?"
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   And sometimes in my mind, it's silence.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   Honestly, I come and I just watch.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   But in my mind, it's like, "Sinner!
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   Confess! Repent before Almighty God!
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   You sinner!"
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   And my parents, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.320]   You're like, "What is the matter with you?"
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:45.320]   Because when we see this in the face of our child, we can see it.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   We can see the hardening.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   And so what I've noticed is that when this happens in my house,
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   I can't tell this kid to say, "Sorry," right?
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   And every parent knows this. This is a talking point.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320]   We all know this.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320]   We all want what?
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   To mean it.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   And we want the kid to mean it.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   So if they say, "Sorry," then we're not satisfied with that.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   And so it's not about getting them just to say the right things.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   What do we want?
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:15.320]   We want them to see.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.320]   Sometimes it can drive a parent crazy when they just stand there.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   There's no fear in them.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   No understanding of broken law or trespass or sinfulness.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   Just all thinking about myself.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.320]   Now, how could you extend comfort to this child?
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.320]   How can you extend grace or mercy to this child?
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   As a parent, you come in, and all you want is to restore this relationship and that relationship.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.320]   That's all you want.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   It's not even about the thing being done anymore.
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   Like, initially, it's just like you want to get to a place where you love them,
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   and you can hug them, and you can say, "It's okay."
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   But you can't say, "It's okay," because of the hardness of their heart.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.320]   You can't.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   They're just standing there.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   "It's okay. I love you. I forgive you."
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.320]   They're just standing there.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   But there are other times when I see that they can understand.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   It's in their response.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   It's written on their face.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   They can't hide it.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   They immediately start crying.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   So this kid is crying here, and another kid is crying here.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.320]   That's a good sign.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.320]   They say, "Sorry."
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   They know they did wrong.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   There's some fear in them.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   They heard dad's footsteps approaching.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   In that place, can I tell you as a parent, my first response is to want to hug.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.320]   I want to extend mercy.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.320]   I want to extend comfort.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   I want to say, "It's okay."
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:59.320]   Now, there's things that have to be talked about, but that's my heart.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   I think about this sometimes when I think of this image of a Pharisee
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.320]   who's so bold and arrogant and all the puffed-up knowledge,
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   who believes in his prayers about a great God,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.320]   a great God of great size and sheer magnitude,
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   about a God that is so holy,
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:19.320]   this Pharisee who's able to explain to great detail what the Holy of Holies is like,
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   why the curtain is there, why gold overlay, why the purple color,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   why all of these things, that they're able to explain it and teach it to people.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   They're able to say with their mouths, with great theological understanding,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.320]   that God is a great God.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.320]   They're standing there before God saying, "God, thank you for not making me like this man right here."
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.320]   You look and pivot, and you stare at another man that's there that's broken,
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   weeping, crying next to them.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.320]   All that's coming out of their mouth is, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   Who has greater understanding here?
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   There or there?
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   Where does the heart of God go?
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.320]   Here or there?
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   When Jesus says, "Do not be afraid,"
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   there is a foundational aspect of fear
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   that ought to be there.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   The natural response of fear has already been instilled.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   He cannot say, "Do not fear," to those who are not fearing to begin with.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   He cannot give us comfort, even in the things that we fear in this world,
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   because we're not even looking at Him.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.320]   He just can't.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   So going back to these passages where Jesus says, "Do not fear,"
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   because the natural response of fear has already been instilled.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   That's why passage after passage, the response was, "Fear, fear, fear,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:57.320]   afraid, scared, terrified, falling, move away from me, get out of our city."
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:02.320]   And then He says, "Don't be afraid."
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   That's the appropriate sequence.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   So when we think about the things we fear in our lives,
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   the fear of God must be the foundation of everything.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   That's why the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.320]   is the beginning of our sight, understanding, reality, paradigm.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320]   It affects our decisions.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   It affects the way we perceive wrongs.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   It affects everything, because God.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   Brings us to our fourth point.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   So in Luke, the common response was fear.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   And then He says, "Do not be afraid."
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   And so in our fourth point then, the fear of God actually brings us comfort.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.320]   I love this so much.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   The fear of God brings us comfort.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   When Jesus says, "Do not fear," notice that it's a command.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320]   It's an imperative.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   It's an order or a call to action.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   It's telling us what we must do.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   That's what a command is.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   But how much of this actually is a command in the way we might two-dimensionally think about it?
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.320]   I thought about it as I sat there in the middle of the night with my son one day.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.320]   When he's crying because he's scared of the dark, I thought about it also with my daughter.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   It's crying because she's afraid someone's going to walk through her front door and asking if the doors are locked.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   I'm sitting there.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   And as a parent, especially as a male, I think it's a very male thing to try to solve, rationalize.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   So I'm sitting there with a five-year-old and a three-year-old trying to rationalize.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.320]   And it's so funny.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   It was like the rationalizing I need to do is actually not quite rational.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   But I have to tell them things.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Like, "You don't have to be afraid of someone breaking into our house."
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   Like, "Why? Isn't that an actual reality?"
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   He's right back there, so I'm trying to be quiet.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.320]   I was like, "Someone could break in. That's the reality."
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   "But what do you say? You can't say that to a kid in the middle of the night."
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   "Yeah, that's true."
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   I had to try all sorts of things, even ridiculous things.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   Things that look so foolish.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   If you were to look at me through the monitor, you'd just be like, "It's so funny.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   A grown man trying to convince them that this doll will somehow protect them."
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.320]   You're sitting there trying to rationalize, rationalize.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.320]   What I learned?
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   Nothing works. Nothing works!
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   Drives you crazy.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   Like, you figure out something that works,
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   an hour later they're calling you again and saying the same thing.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   Like, "We had this talk. What's the matter with you?"
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.320]   It ends in heightened anger.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   You're like, "Go to sleep! Please!"
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   But as a parent, what I realized, the only thing that works is when I say,
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.320]   "Daddy is here." It's very fascinating to me.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.320]   I say, "Daddy's here. You don't have to be afraid because I'm here."
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.320]   There's nothing else that works like it.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   It's funny. To my kids, it's so ridiculous.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:24.320]   They think I'm the biggest, strongest, tallest person in the world.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.320]   I can take out any of you guys in my kids' eyes.
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   I don't care what kind of MMA you do.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   In my kids' eyes, if I'm going up against you, you're dead.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   I could beat any game. I could do miracles.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   I could heal with a band-aid.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   With my words, I could cause things to happen.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   I do magic. That's who they see.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:14:01.320]   When God is not big in us, I wonder what kind of sight do we have of Him?
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.320]   When God says, "Do not be afraid," and we continue to be fearful,
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:13.320]   what kind of relationship do we have with our God?
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   With them, it's almost ridiculous.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   But that peace comes to them.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.320]   Without the fear of the Lord, there can be no comfort.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   Without an understanding of this fearsome sight of a huge God,
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   about what He can do, what He is able to do,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.320]   the magnitude and scope of that is the thing that will bring comfort into us,
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.320]   just as it will bring comfort from daddy to child.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   It doesn't matter if their understanding is erroneous.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   They're sitting there, and what matters is what they believe.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.320]   "Dad will protect me. Dad will always be there."
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.320]   So that sight, that understanding, that belief,
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   causes them to be able to go back to sleep.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   It actually eases all of their fear, because Dad is scary.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   Dad is strong. Dad is big.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   Luke, as a book, is filled with this idea of fear God,
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   and then this comforting command, "Do not fear."
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   This is where we encounter, just shortly, a servile versus filial fear.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   There's two types of fear that we can look at.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   R.C. Sproul talks about servile fear as referring to a posture of servitude
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   toward a malevolent owner.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   It's a fear of anxiety that comes because we are terrified of this person,
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   this person of power who can do us great harm.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320]   That's servile fear.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   This idea of filial fear has more to do when a child has fear of their parents,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.320]   something like that.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.320]   R.C. Sproul says, "It is a fear of offending the one he loves,
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   not because he's afraid of torture or even of punishment,
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.320]   but rather because he's afraid of displeasing the one who is,
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   in that child's world, the source of security and love."
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320]   I love that last part.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   It's this idea of displeasing.
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   Sometimes we have that idea of displeasing God, and we're afraid of that,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   but this idea of displeasing the one who is our everything.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   My kids do that.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   They do something wrong, and immediately,
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320]   do you know what they do when they do something wrong?
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.320]   Their eyes just go to you.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   It's so funny.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320]   Did you see?
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   Even when they do something right, they go, "Whew!"
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.320]   Did you see?
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   This is the incredible nature of adoption as children of God.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.320]   Our response and reaction must be set immediately on true sight.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   We don't jump to grace and mercy.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   We can't.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.320]   We need to first see God for who he is.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.320]   Do we get that?
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.320]   We don't jump to grace and mercy and love
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.320]   because we are so filled with a view of ourselves.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.320]   We think we deserve it, but we can't.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   We must see God for who he is, the massive God, the creator.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320]   He can do whatever he wants,
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   but as soon as he adopts me as his child,
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.320]   when we have this pervading and bigger and growing magnitude of God and who he is,
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   that our fear of him grows,
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   that when that fear grows, he says, "Do not fear."
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.320]   We cannot be afraid of anything in this world.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.320]   It doesn't matter how big that fear seems.
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.320]   God.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.320]   Now, if you're an unbeliever, fear is appropriate,
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.320]   but it's a servile fear.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   Matthew 10.28 says, "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul,
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   In Hebrews 10.30 it says, "For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   And again, the Lord will judge people."
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   It is appropriate for you to be afraid of God
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   because he is not for you, he is against you.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   There is no story of hope.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   There is no Disney happy ending for you.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.320]   There is only a call for you to turn to him and surrender.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.320]   He is a good God.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.320]   If you are a believer, it also means fear God,
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:44.320]   but you are now under not a servile fear, but a filial fear.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.320]   Appropriately understand who he is.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   He has not in any way changed in who he was before you became a believer.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.320]   He has been the same yesterday, today, forever.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   He is immutable. He does not change.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.320]   We fear him because we see who he is still.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320]   All of it is out of love.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   Our fear of God as it's grown because we walk with him, we know who he is.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   We understand not just in here, but because I'm walking with him day by day.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   I'm talking to him. I'm hearing from him.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   The experience is there of me abiding.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   You cannot think of abiding without experience.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.320]   That there is a true understanding that goes beyond just facts that are running through your head.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   It's him.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   I cannot doubt his existence.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:34.320]   It's not just factual like, "Could he potentially be all this?"
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   No, no, no, because I know him.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   We look and we see this kind of God.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   Isn't it so close to us? Isn't it so quick?
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.320]   When we look at something like, "He will do all things together for the good of those who love him,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   who are called according to his purposes."
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   I believe that. I know that that's who he is.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   It is not just a Bible thought.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320]   It is not just a Christian concept of belief.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   That's him.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   That's who he is.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   Our God is for us. Who then can be against us?
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   That's who God is.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   Psalm 56.3 says, "When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you."
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.320]   It says, "When I am afraid."
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.320]   Fear is a given. We are fearers. We fear things.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:29.320]   But it says, "When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you."
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.320]   If our view of God is so low and weak, our trust has to be weak.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   Because we don't actually believe him.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.320]   We don't actually trust him.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   But when it's big, it's different.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.320]   1 Peter 5.6 says, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   that he may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you."
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   Brings us to our fifth and final point.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   Do you trust God?
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320]   And this is where I just want to give it back to you now.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320]   I want to ask you this question.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   Do you trust God?
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   Our sight can't be based on me.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:13.320]   It needs to be based on him.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   The fear of God is the foundation and the hinge and the beginning.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.320]   And the fear of God is what leads us right.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320]   So it's fixed on him.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320]   But do you trust him?
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320]   It changes our whole lives.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   Everything that we fear is not that God is going to correct it to the way we want it to be.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   Because our lives are not based upon what I see in my own life.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   It's not on self-idolatry anymore.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   It's not on just what I want anymore.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   I look at God and he consumes everything.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   He becomes everything to me.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320]   And I fear him.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.320]   So even when things aren't going the way I might want it to go,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.320]   in fact and in reality, a great trust happens there.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   Because even if none of the things that I want happens in my life,
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.320]   it will not shake me.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   Because I trust in God.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.320]   He is the center.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   He is the one that we fear.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   When everything is going wrong,
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   we understand that we live for God's glory, God's desire,
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   because that's who he is.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   He's God.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   And at the end, his desire is for his glory and our good.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.320]   It's a package deal.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   You cannot have the "for my good" without him.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   And we'll be ultimately brought to a place
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   where the things of this world are going to just start dissolving away.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   I think great counseling happens just naturally every day in the lives of believers
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320]   as they encounter the Word of God.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   Because there are places and times when we go to a counselor
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320]   and we ask them to help us to understand.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.320]   But natural counseling always happens
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   because all it's doing is drawing you to God, to his words,
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   to believe in him.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:59.320]   Because when you're walking with him, fears just naturally melt away.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   Again, don't take it like with the concept.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.320]   Try to really think about the experiences that you had in your life.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320]   Is it difficult? Yes.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320]   I'm not saying the difficulty is not there.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:12.320]   I'm saying the fear is dissolved, that your trust grows in those places.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   We're not mastered by our fears.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.320]   We're not mastered by the fear of a pandemic
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   or of a certain politics that's sweeping over the state.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:24.320]   We're not afraid of kids getting the best education,
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   the threat of lost jobs,
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320]   of a career that doesn't satisfy,
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.320]   never getting married, not having kids,
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   developing a life-threatening disease, loss of reputation.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   We're not afraid of these things.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   Why? Because we're not supposed to? No, no, they're scary.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   But because as we walk with the Lord, the fear of God dissolves all these things.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   We understand that we want Him to be everything.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:57.320]   There must be surrendering and yielding of our will before God in this.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.320]   So my hope is as we go into this new year,
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.320]   that we don't jump to that comfort part.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.320]   We want all of God's comfort
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   so that we might attain to whatever it is that my heart desires so much.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   That we need to appropriately go through these steps.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.320]   No fear of God, there is no understanding.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:19.320]   No fear of God, there is no knowledge.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   So that's the question that I want echoing in all of us.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   Where's my fear?
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.320]   Have I been cultivating a fear of God?
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.320]   Have I been cultivating a fear of many other things?
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.320]   Let me leave you with Psalm 23.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   And just to highlight, I know many of us know this,
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   but the pronouns.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   The pronouns are so important in this Psalm.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   In Psalm 23 it says,
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.320]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   He restores my soul.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness for His namesake.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   I fear no evil for you are with me.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.320]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320]   My cup overflows.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.320]   Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.320]   and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   And the pronouns.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.320]   There are so many things we know conceptually about our God.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320]   We know that He is our shepherd.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   We know that He will lead me into green pastures.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   We know that He will lead me to quiet waters.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.320]   He will restore my soul.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.320]   He will guide me in paths of righteousness.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.320]   But in this passage, it's so powerful when David pivots into the you,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320]   from the third to the second pronoun of God,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.320]   and he says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   I will fear no evil for not He is with me, but you are with me."
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.320]   And that idea of intimacy and knowledge is powerful
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   because it's not about knowing facts about God.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.320]   It is walking with Him.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   It's understanding that there are going to be dark times in our lives,
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   and the fear isn't going to evaporate in just knowing that God will just make things happen right.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.320]   It's when we feel close to Him, when we know He's real,
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   when we know that all will be right in the world because I am in His embrace,
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   that if you today have gotten so far from that because of your present-day fear,
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320]   that your fear of the Lord isn't exuding into the way we make our decisions,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:23.320]   into our convictions, into the way we even just feel,
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   that we might properly go into the new year with a fear of God that takes over and consumes all else.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.320]   Let me pray for us.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:46.320]   Heavenly Father, I pray that you will not just cast away our fears.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.320]   God, some of the things that many of our church members are facing right now are scary.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   It's hard and it's very difficult.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.320]   It's dark and it's lonely.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   God, we can't reason those things away.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:09.320]   We can't just insert facts that we ought to trust you into our brains.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:15.320]   Lord, I pray that our church will be people who walk with you.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.320]   Lord, please, we need you.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.320]   We're so led by so many other worships, so many other gods.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   Will we come again to you today and say, "You are our God alone.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   We fear you alone.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   There is no one like you. There is no one but you.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   There is only you in our lives.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   Fill our viewfinders.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:47.320]   Fill our lens, our landscape, our worldview, that the way we see would be through the fear of God.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   Help us transform our hearts.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.320]   Help us to be near to you, to draw near to you in every way.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.320]   Let's all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:11.320]   Be thou my vision.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:21.320]   Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   Naught be all else to me, save that thou art.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   Thou my best thought, by day or by night.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   Be thou my wisdom.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:16.320]   I am your with me, and thou with me, Lord.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:26.320]   Now my great Father, I thy true son.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   Thou with me dwelling, and I with thee one.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:52.320]   Riches I need not, riches I need not, nor man's empty praise.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   Thou mine inheritance, now and always.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   Thou and thou only, first in my heart.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:20.320]   High King of heaven, my treasure thou art.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:28.320]   High King of heaven.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:38.320]   High King of heaven, my victory won.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:48.320]   May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's sun.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:57.320]   Heart of my own heart, whatever befall.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.320]   Heart of my own.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:17.320]   Heart of my own heart, whatever befall.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:27.320]   Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   Heavenly Father, help us, God, to not just desire to have our fears cast away, but again,
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.320]   Lord, to walk with you, to see you rightly and clearly, and to fear you with all our hearts.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:52.320]   Help us, Lord, not to let these things be, again, concepts or passing convictions, that
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   you will not allow a single believer to walk out these doors without being transformed
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   by your word.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   Help us, Father.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.320]   We need you.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   And as small as we are, as small a speck as we are, help us to even understand the greatness
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   of your love for us, that you might do such a great and powerful work inside of people
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.320]   who do not deserve any of it.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   You are a good God.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   Now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God our Father, and the fellowship
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.320]   of the Holy Spirit be with us all, now and forevermore.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.320]   Amen.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:31.320]   God sent his Son.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:37.320]   They called him Jesus.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:43.320]   He came to them.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:49.320]   He lived and died.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:55.320]   To buy my poor world.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   An empty grave is there to save your land.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:37.320]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:57.320]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:19.320]   Amen.
