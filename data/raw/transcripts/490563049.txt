[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, we're going to be reading
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.720]   from verse 17 to 19.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.640]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 17 to 19.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.760]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.640]   By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.520]   was offering up his only begotten son.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.080]   It was he to whom it was said, "In Isaac your descendants shall be called."
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.480]   He considered that God is able to raise people from the dead, from which he also received
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.400]   him back as a type.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   Let's pray.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.720]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint this time, and may your word be lifted up,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.780]   Lord God, that your voice and only your voice may be heard.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.320]   Help us, Lord, not only to be hearers, but not to turn from it to the left or to the
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.920]   right, that we may be anchored in Christ, especially now with all that's going on.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040]   So we pray that you would bless this time.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560]   You know, because of what's been going on around us with the pandemic, there's been
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.380]   a lot of question about what is essential and non-essential.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.600]   And so I think everybody, to a certain degree, and for sure as leaders, we've been having
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   constant conversations as what is essential, what is not essential.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.480]   And obviously the gathering of the believers on Sunday is not something that we are willing
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   to compromise.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.280]   You know, we want to do our best to keep, you know, to be, to keep the church safe.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.080]   We want to submit to the authorities, as the Bible says, but at the same time we do not
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.920]   want to compromise our essentials.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.960]   Now along with that, whether you are a leader in the church or not, every single family
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.360]   probably has been asking that question, right?
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   I hear that the toilet paper is starting to disappear, you know, just like in the beginning
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.440]   of what was going on in March.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.760]   People are going, "Just in case, we don't know what's going to happen."
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.720]   So people are stocking up again.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.840]   So what are things that are essential that you need to have, right?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.520]   For whatever the reason, toilet paper, maybe water, some canned goods, right?
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.800]   What if the apocalypse happens?
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   What happens?
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   Are you going to, you know, do you have a car that you're going to be able to use?
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   What are the essentials that you would gather?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.200]   I remember years ago, you know, when the Northridge earthquake hit, I had a friend who was in
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   college and this condemned, the building that he was in, he was a Northridge college student,
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.760]   and the building was shaking and it was actually condemned.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.840]   But right after the shaking stopped, he ran out and to the dismay of his friends, he ran
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.920]   back in because he said he needed to go get his essential stuff, and he went back in and
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.120]   grabbed his Bible and his MacArthur commentaries.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440]   And that's when we knew that this guy was a MacArthur freak, you know?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640]   He literally risked his life to go back and get his commentaries.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.880]   And then sure enough, a day later, the whole building just collapsed, you know?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.920]   So he literally, like we know what was in his heart, right?
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.760]   He wanted his Bible and his commentaries.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.280]   But for every single Christian, like what is essential?
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   What are some things?
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.760]   Obviously, there's some physical things that you'll get.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.960]   If you have small children, obviously, that's the first thing that you'll run in and get.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.000]   But aside from the physical things, what is absolutely essential?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.320]   The answer is pretty clear.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.960]   Our faith is absolutely essential.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.560]   And that's why, again, that we're gathering together despite what's going on because worship
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.480]   of our God and our faith is absolutely essential.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.480]   Faith is what connects us to this eternal life, the father of, the author of life.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.600]   Without faith, it says, at the beginning of this chapter, it is impossible to please him.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.860]   And when he says that, he's not simply talking about, you know, God being pleased or displeased.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.480]   Without faith, there is no relationship with God.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   So one of the most crucial, essential things that we need to make sure that is genuine
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.720]   is our faith.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.000]   So Abraham, he says he's the father of faith.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.640]   He's the father of faith because God initiated a covenant relationship with the nation of
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   Israel through this man, that God was going to establish a nation where through them,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.040]   he's going to bless the world.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.240]   And obviously, the son of God was going to come through that line.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.560]   But along with that, Abraham is the perfect example of what God desires of his people,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280]   to walk by faith.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.800]   And so in order to establish that and to give us an example for us to follow, the cloud
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.480]   of witnesses that we are to follow as an example, he tested his faith.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.800]   And that's what he said.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   The first thing that it says in verse 17, by faith, when he was tested, offered up Isaac.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   So Abraham's faith had to be tested.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   Now, again, if you're a Calvinist, you may look at that and say, well, if God is sovereign,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.440]   why does he have to know?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.360]   Didn't he already know?
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.200]   Why did he have to test him?
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   Look at it this way.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   You know, whenever we go out to purchase a car, we test the car, right?
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   Now, the buyer is the one testing the car, not the owner.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.240]   The owner already knows what the car is, and it's already out on display.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   So the one who purchased it for himself is the one who is actually testing it to make
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.560]   sure that that is something that he wants and to embrace.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.680]   So in the same way, when the scripture says that God tested him, it was really to prove
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.480]   for Abraham, to make sure that he knew where he stood, to purify his faith.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.520]   In 1 Peter 1, 6-7, he says, "In this you greatly rejoice."
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.120]   And he's talking about the persecution and suffering that's coming.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.320]   "Even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.040]   so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold, which is perishable."
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.040]   In other words, sometimes God will take what is perishable in order to give us what is
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.200]   imperishable, a greater faith, even though tested by fire may be found to result in praise
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   and glory, honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.400]   Because faith is the most valuable thing that we possess, because that's what connects us
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.600]   to God, our process of sanctification is to purify this faith, that we live by faith and
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   not by sight.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.480]   And that's why Abraham is being tested.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.760]   Even though he walked out and followed God's command, every year of his life, every activity,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.440]   every suffering that Abraham had to suffer through, it was to purify his faith.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.160]   And it's no different with us.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:44.120]   If your faith in God hasn't grown from the first time you met God until now, then you
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.480]   are not a mature Christian.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.120]   A mature Christian is not somebody who just knows the Bible, has much experience doing
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.960]   this and that and gone overseas and made disciples.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.280]   That's not what makes you a mature Christian.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.840]   A mature Christian, according to scripture, is somebody who is increasing in his faith.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.780]   Because power that you and I have is not within us, it's our connection to God.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.960]   So the greater the faith, the greater the connection that we have with God.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   That's what makes an individual mature, not what we accumulate from our experience and
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.720]   our learning, but God.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.320]   As you guys know, if you want to buy a used car, which car is more expensive?
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.860]   Toyotas and Camrys are usually more expensive.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.800]   And the reason why they're more expensive is because there's a record, a proven track
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:41.880]   record that they can possibly go up to 200, 300,000 miles, which is unheard of.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.120]   When I was younger, if the car passed 100,000 miles or 150,000 miles, we considered that
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.000]   a very good car.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.560]   So I remember years ago, my brother Phillip, he drove his Camry over 200,000 miles and
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.120]   I said, "Wow, Camry went 200,000 miles."
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.580]   I don't know if you've ever tried to look for a used car now.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.880]   Now they have people who are selling their cars for thousands of dollars that have gone
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:12.540]   over 250,000 miles or 300,000 miles, and they're usually Toyotas and Camrys.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.800]   And that's why they pay a premium because they know if you're 200,000, there's a possibility
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.920]   you can go over another 100,000 miles.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.000]   Our faith, when it is not tested, it doesn't matter how passionate we are.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.280]   It doesn't matter how much we know.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   It doesn't matter how much experience that we have.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.240]   When it is not tested, we may be building our faith, building our Christian life on
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.840]   a foundation that's shaky.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.240]   And that's why anyone that God is going to use for his glory, that faith is first and
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.400]   foremost tested, proven, to make sure because the strength of who we are is directly linked
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.080]   to the strength of the faith that we have in God.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   So that's what it says.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.040]   It starts off by saying that Abraham's faith was tested.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   How was he tested?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.000]   Obviously, God asked him to offer up his son, his only begotten son.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.880]   There's two things that I want to highlight here about what God commands of Abraham that
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.800]   demonstrates this faith.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.720]   First of all, the test was to make sure that Abraham trusted in the giver and not the gift,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.680]   that his faith was founded upon the promises of God, that he recognized the fulfillment
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.760]   of the promise was faithfulness God himself and not the gift that he received.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.280]   Hebrews chapter 11, 7-18, it says, "By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac,
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.920]   and he had received the promises, was offering up his only begotten son."
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.360]   Where did you hear that term before?
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.080]   Of Jesus, right?
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   Only begotten.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   Now, a lot of people get confused because of the English word begotten and saying, "Well,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.840]   doesn't begotten mean that God gave birth to Jesus?
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.760]   So doesn't that mean that he was created by God?"
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.000]   Well, that word begotten does not mean that at all.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   In the Greek, it means monogenes.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   The word monogenes, where you get the word mono, obviously one, only.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.720]   Genes basically means from those people.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.560]   The literal meaning of that is he's the only one, unique.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   In fact, in Genesis chapter 22, it kind of explains maybe in better English term, now
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.240]   it came about after these things that God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham,"
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.360]   and he said, "Here I am."
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.280]   He said, "Take now your son, your only son, your only son."
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.440]   That's what that word monogenes means.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.000]   There's nobody like him.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.600]   He's unique.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.440]   It doesn't mean that he was created by God.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.720]   Now why is this important?
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:11:01.200]   When he said that Isaac was his son, his only son, was that Abraham's only son?
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.160]   Was Isaac Abraham's only son?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.660]   No.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.320]   He had Ishmael from his servant girl, Hagar.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.080]   But what does he mean here when he says, "Isaac, your son, your only son?"
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.920]   He's talking about his unique begotten only son, unique, because that's the line in which
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.880]   God was going to fulfill his covenant.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.360]   And so that's why he says in verse 18, "It was he to whom it was said, 'In Isaac your
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.680]   descendants shall be called.'"
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.760]   Isaac is only begotten, the one and only, because that's the line in which God was going
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.960]   to fulfill all the promises that he made to Abraham and Sarah.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.040]   Now isn't that a strange thing to say?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.720]   I want you to offer up your covenant child, your only covenant child, that everything
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.560]   that you have abandoned to follow me, where I am going to fulfill all your descendants,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.400]   everything that I said to you in Genesis chapter 12, 1-3, he's the guy that I'm going to fulfill.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.920]   All your descendants are going to come through this guy.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.520]   Offer him up.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.880]   I mean, that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.120]   Well, if he said, you know what, offer him up because I have another child coming.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.320]   You know, they made the mistake the first time, because God wasn't acting fast enough,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.000]   so by their own will they had Hagar and they gave birth to Ishmael, and they said, no,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.720]   that's not the one, and God gives Isaac.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.120]   And so maybe God has another child, but that's not what he said.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   No, he's that child.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.080]   He's your only begotten son.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.480]   Your descendant, everything I promised you is going to come through that line, and it's
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.360]   that child I'm commanding you to sacrifice.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.240]   What was God doing?
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.720]   God was testing Abraham, again, to prove his faith.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.440]   What is your confidence on the gift or the giver?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.760]   Is the hope that you have, the covenant that God made with you, is that covenant based
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.800]   upon the promise of God or your child Isaac, your only begotten son?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.560]   Now on the surface, it doesn't make any sense that God would command to offer up what he
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:29.400]   said he's going to use to fulfill a promise, and yet what God was doing was testing.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.840]   Where is your confidence?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.880]   You know, there are things that God places in our lives to help us to grow in our faith.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.600]   Just like if you go to a hospital, you know, and you sprained your ankle or you broke your
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.960]   leg and they'll put a cast on and, you know, and they have you walk on a crutch.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   And that crutch is good.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.880]   In fact, it's even necessary to help you to walk.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   But imagine if you went in and said, "You know, I like this crutch.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240]   Can I keep it on?"
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.840]   You say, "Well, it's been three months.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   Your leg is fine."
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480]   He's like, "No, no, no, it's not fine.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.240]   I'd rather have the crutch."
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   Imagine if you kept the crutch for six months to a year, two years, five years.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.720]   For the rest of your life, you said, "I can't walk without this crutch."
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   So that very crutch that God gave you to help you now has become a hindrance because the
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.960]   purpose of the crutch was to get you to be healed and to be whole.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.480]   There's a lot of things that we do in our life where we thank God for the gift and then
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   the gift becomes the problem.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.960]   We make it a crutch that is necessary.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.280]   And we make the gift the idol.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.920]   I run into a lot of college students, you know, and they, while I were in college, they
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.240]   had a leader, a follower, and they had certain kind of, you know, freshmen and older brother,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.600]   younger sister and discipleship, and they experienced this Christian life in this bubble.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.280]   And then when they graduate, they can't function because they need that again.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.600]   In order for me to have God, where's my leader?
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   Who's my follower?
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   Who's my this?
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.320]   And how come the organization is this way and that way?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.440]   And they made this crutch a necessity for their walk with God.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.340]   The purpose of it is to bring us to God.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.480]   The purpose of why he gave the church is to bring us to God.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.960]   Think how often we make the gift that God has given us into a burden because we make
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.080]   that the idol.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.960]   Sometimes we do that even with the church.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.520]   You know, it's great to have the church, great to have the fellowship, but I can't grow without
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520]   it.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.000]   I can't meet God without it.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.400]   And then it becomes a crutch.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.320]   Remember in John chapter 5, 39 to 40, you search the scriptures because you think that
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.500]   in them you have eternal life.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.440]   How often does the word of God become a burden because this is something that every good
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.760]   Christian should do.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:04.480]   We need to exposit, we need to memorize, and we need to know systematic theology.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.520]   If you're a good Christian, you need to pray 15 minutes, an hour, you need to do it in
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.840]   the morning, you need to memorize.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.800]   And then you make this the idol.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.880]   So when you have this, you think, "Oh, that's a good Christian because he's read the Bible
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.120]   so many times and knows his systematic theology, he knows how to exegete, he knows how to teach
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   other people."
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.200]   But Jesus is saying you're looking through scripture thinking that somehow if you look
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.680]   at it and obey it, that's where eternal life is.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   It's a no.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.160]   But purpose of this is to bring you to Christ.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   So you can spend all your life maturing in knowledge and experience and never have greater
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.640]   and increasing faith in Christ.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.400]   Look what he says.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.800]   You look to scripture because you think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.140]   It is these that testify about me.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.860]   And you are unwilling to come to me so that you may have life.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.920]   He wanted to make sure that Isaac was not his hope.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.480]   He wanted to make sure that he wasn't hanging all his hopes upon his health.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.600]   Even if Isaac was, everything hinged upon Isaac, right?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.560]   I mean, imagine, right?
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.760]   It's like he had to have the best seats.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.640]   You know, I mean, you'd freak out every time he gets sick, right?
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.600]   If any of his brothers somehow, you know, incringes upon anything, it's like, "Oh, you're
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.380]   not just protecting your son, you're protecting your hope."
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.540]   He wanted to make sure that he didn't make Isaac his idol.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:45.820]   Look at the way that the Pharisees approached the Sabbath.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.740]   God told them to keep the Sabbath holy, but they wanted to keep it so holy that they created
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.800]   additional laws on top of what God said.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.420]   So they kept on accusing Jesus of breaking the Sabbath.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.180]   He never broke the Sabbath.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.420]   He broke their application of the Sabbath.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.260]   The tradition that they created saying, "You know what?
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.940]   Keeping the Sabbath means that you can go this far, but if you go beyond that, you're
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.280]   breaking the Sabbath."
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.020]   So they were judging people based upon what they thought breaking the Sabbath meant.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.700]   Not what the Bible said, but what they thought breaking the Sabbath meant.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.820]   So they kept on saying, "Why are you breaking the Sabbath?
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.860]   Why are you breaking the Sabbath?"
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.700]   Jesus answered them in Mark 2, 27.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.100]   Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:36.220]   So the man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.580]   The very name Sabbath means to rest.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:47.860]   And you made it a to-do list, and instead of finding rest and making Christ Lord of
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:53.580]   the Sabbath, it becomes an additional burden for you to carry out.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.980]   Instead of bringing you to Christ, it's keeping you away from Christ.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.980]   And that's what he was saying.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.980]   He was reversing that.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.660]   He said, "You missed the whole point of the Sabbath.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:08.540]   Sabbath was made for you, so that you can recuperate, so you can rest, so you can worship
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.220]   God, so your faith would increase in who He is.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:20.060]   But because you made it into rules, now Sabbath is destroying you."
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.240]   That's exactly what John was trying to say in the book of John.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.100]   What Jesus was saying with the seven "I am" statements.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.500]   People were coming to Him and said, "You're eating bread, and you want more bread."
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   He says, "I am the bread."
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.460]   You're looking for the Messiah to come, and just like God used the clouds and the light,
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.900]   pillar of light to lead people, you're looking for the Messiah to come and shed light.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.100]   He says, "I am the light."
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.100]   You're looking for like, you know, which, where do we go?
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.380]   Do we want to be part of the synagogue?
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.540]   We want to be accepted in a community.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.380]   And Jesus says, "I am the door."
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.460]   We're begging Him, "Won't you come and make sure that our brother Lazarus lives a little
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.460]   bit longer, make him healthy so that he doesn't die?"
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.860]   And Jesus allows him to die, so that He can make it point.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.380]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.380]   These are the people who are looking for leaders to guide them and lead them.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.540]   Who should we follow?
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.140]   The Pharisees or the Sadducees?
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.060]   And Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.060]   Where do we go?
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.860]   If you leave us, where are we going to go?
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.500]   He says, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.300]   Well if you leave us, how are we going to bear fruit?
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.300]   How are we going to know what to do?
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.700]   Jesus says, "I am divine."
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:42.260]   Every one of these "I am" statements is to shatter through the idols that they were
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.820]   hanging their hats on and then saying, "I am."
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.940]   That's exactly what He was trying to teach Abraham.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.900]   Even though Isaac is the promised child, the only begotten child, the promise isn't based
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.260]   upon Isaac and his health and how long he's going to live, how many children he's going
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.260]   to have.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.340]   Because there's going to come times when that's not going to make sense.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.980]   He may come to the verge of death, but you should not be shaken.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:17.180]   He might even die, but your faith should not be shaken.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:22.660]   Because the promise is not based upon him, but God.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.540]   Abraham by this time knew this.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.740]   That was not the faith that he had.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.420]   He believed in God enough to walk out, but that's not the faith that he had early on.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.020]   Because remember early on, right, he's like, "How come it's taking so long?"
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.020]   Right?
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.020]   And he was going to fulfill it himself because he couldn't see what God was going to do.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:47.340]   It was hard in the beginning, but after 20, 25 years, when he turned 100 and his wife
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.360]   90 years old, now it's impossible.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.660]   But by this time, what does he say?
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.300]   Genesis 22, 3, when God told him, he just said, "Abraham rose early in the morning,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.220]   saddled his donkey, and just left."
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:02.620]   Now, I'm not sure if Abraham said anything because it's not recorded, but all it says
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.460]   was he believed God and he just did it.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.900]   Because he believed that even if he dies, he can raise him.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.220]   In other words, I trust him.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.900]   He's proven himself to me.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:23.540]   When times I didn't believe him and I questioned him and I self-willed myself to fulfill this
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.980]   promise, he broke into all of that and he showed me to trust him.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   And that's what he was trying to fulfill here.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:35.060]   And that's why in Psalm chapter 20, verse 7, the Psalmist says, "Some trust in chariots,
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:41.660]   some trust in horses, but we trust the name of the Lord."
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.900]   So that's a lesson that every person of faith not only needs to have, but continue to increase
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.940]   and grow.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.420]   That the stability and foundation of the refuge does not based upon who's around us, promises
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.220]   of the economy, who's going to be the leader, how much money did you save for retirement,
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.640]   do you have enough friends around you, what community do you belong to?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:11.140]   But in the end, all that God promises hinges upon his faithfulness, despite all that happens
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.140]   around us.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:19.740]   Secondly, the test is to prove something even deeper than that.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.180]   The test was to see whom Abraham loved.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.740]   It says in Genesis 22, 1-2, "Now it came about after these things that God tested Abraham
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.180]   and said to him, 'Abraham,' and he said, 'Here I am.'
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:39.780]   He said, 'Take now your son, your only son, and then he has whom you love,' and offered
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   him."
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:47.220]   I mean, can you imagine how much this child was loved?
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:54.580]   They left everything, risked everything, and they waited for so long.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.420]   You know, and every once in a while, you'll, you know, and maybe some of you are in that
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.820]   category where you wanted a child for so long, and you prayed and prayed, and you thought
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:09.100]   maybe you weren't going to have a child, and you saw all the other people having children,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.380]   and the pain that kind of comes with that, like, "Why isn't God blessing me?"
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.500]   And then when you lost all hope, and then you have a child, right?
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.740]   I've walked with some people who went through that.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:25.620]   I had a friend who actually was a pastor of a church nearby, and he prayed for over 10,
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:31.020]   11 years, and didn't have a child, and they were almost kind of getting ready to, like,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.460]   "Okay, maybe that's just going to be our lot in life," and he was ready to move on, and
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:42.140]   for 10 years, that's what he was praying for, and then on the 11th year, he had kids.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.140]   And I don't even have to describe to you the kind of joy that fell on this family.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.020]   Can you imagine how much joy was brought to this family?
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:25:00.060]   Sarai was barren before she trusted God, and waited years, and when they tried to fulfill
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   it, you know, it caused all kinds of problems with Ishmael.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.020]   "No, trust me."
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.420]   And they actually named the son Isaac because it was so hard to believe.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.420]   They laughed.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.420]   They giggled.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.060]   I think the name Isaac laughter is given for two reasons.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:22.220]   One because in unbelief, they turned around, they laughed, but the second reason, Sarai
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.220]   means princess.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.980]   Sarah means joy and delight.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.380]   Isaac was the fulfillment of that joy and delight.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:35.260]   That's why he's named Isaac, because of the way they reacted, and because of what God
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.820]   intended to bring into that home.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:47.380]   So I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that he was very, very, very loved.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.820]   In fact, I don't think, again, it's an exaggeration.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.580]   I think we would all agree he was probably the most precious thing that they had.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.780]   And God not only said, "He's the fulfillment of your promise," he's something that you'd
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.340]   love more than anything else.
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.340]   Offer him up.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:10.180]   I mean, put yourself in that situation.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:16.660]   Not only is sacrificing Isaac means the future and everything else that God said, but even
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:23.560]   if that wasn't the case, even if he wasn't the fulfillment of all of that, just offering
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:29.620]   up your son that you love so much, that you enjoyed so much, brought so much delight into
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.500]   your lives, and for God said to offer him up.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:40.580]   God was not only testing to see his faith, he was testing to see his affection.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.580]   Who do you love?
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.420]   What do you love more than anything else?
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.620]   I mean, the Bible clearly says the greatest command that God desires from us is to love
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.940]   the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.220]   That's what he desires more than anything else.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.940]   That's why in the book of Revelation, when he talks to the church of Ephesus, he says,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.660]   you have right doctrine, you persevere, you have a lot of good works.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.380]   On the surface, they have everything that a good church should have.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.260]   And he said, yet I have this one thing against you.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.300]   You have forsaken your first love.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.020]   The word for first here is protos.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.860]   Protos is not the word that they would use to describe first, second, third, or fourth.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.520]   Protos basically means in priority, the most.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.820]   So when he says proto agapen, he's basically saying you're doing all the ... externally
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:35.060]   you're doing all of these things, but I'm not your greatest love.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.540]   I'm not your greatest love.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   God is not simply saying you should love me.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.500]   I think most Christians will say that we love God, to a certain degree.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.060]   Whether it's small love or big love, we say we love God.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.980]   We sing about him.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.740]   Is he our greatest love?
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.740]   Protos agapen.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:04.460]   Do you remember when Peter denies Christ and then after the resurrection, he sees them
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:11.020]   at the shore and he restores Peter, John chapter 21, 15 to 17.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.060]   So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of John, do
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.380]   you love me more than these?
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.060]   He said to him, yes Lord, you know that I love you.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.520]   He said, tend my lambs then.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.940]   He said to him again, second time, Simon son of John, do you love me?
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.080]   He said to him, yes Lord, you know that I love you.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.700]   He said to him, shepherd my sheep.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.220]   He said to him, third time, Simon son of John, do you love me?
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.460]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, do you love me?
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.140]   And he said to him, Lord, you know all things.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.140]   You know that I love you.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.460]   Jesus said to him, tend my sheep.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.640]   Some people have taken this tax and say, you know what, the reason why he asked him three
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.820]   times is because Peter answered wrong.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.220]   So in the Greek, Jesus asked, do you agape me?
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.940]   And the first time he says, yes Lord, you know I phileo you.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.940]   And then the second time Jesus says, do you agape me?
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.540]   And he says, yes Lord, you know I phileo you.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.940]   Third time Jesus says, do you really phileo me?
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.500]   And Jesus said, you know all things, Lord.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.660]   You know I phileo you.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.180]   So some people have looked at that and said, you know, God was asking for agape and he
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.380]   said phileo, so he got it wrong.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.540]   This is the third time Jesus gave in.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.780]   Clearly you're not going to agape me, so do you phileo me?
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.580]   I'm going to accept a lesser love, phileo, so he said yes.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.100]   That's how some people look at that and I don't think that's what's going on.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:36.020]   Because in the Greek, the word agape and phileo is often used interchangeably and this is
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.820]   a perfect example of that.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.300]   Because when Jesus asked, do you agape me?
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.580]   Peter doesn't say, no, I phileo you.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.340]   He says, yes, I phileo you.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.700]   Do you agape me?
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.460]   Yes, Lord.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.340]   Of course I phileo you.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.980]   Jesus said, do you really phileo me?
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.700]   And he got hurt.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.580]   If he was answering wrong, right, he said, why would he get hurt?
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.900]   Clearly you're failing the exam.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.020]   Clearly I'm asking you agape, you're saying phileo and Jesus gave in.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.340]   He said, no, it was being used interchangeably, right.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.580]   Then why does he ask him three times?
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.440]   Because the number three is a number of completion.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.380]   So if you read in the Bible, it says where two or three are gathered together.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.820]   Do not entertain an accusation against it unless there's two or three, right.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.560]   The number three Jesus was crucified, was resurrected on the third day to make sure
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.080]   that he actually was dead so that the resurrection was actually a resurrection.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   So the number three is a number of completion, of completeness.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.000]   So when Peter denied Jesus, he said he denied it how many times?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.100]   Three times.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.300]   Now why did he deny him three times?
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.060]   Maybe if he denied once, he'd say, oh, that was a slip of his tongue.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.060]   He was just under pressure.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:06.980]   He said, no, he denied it three times, meaning that it was a very willful rejection.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:11.980]   So in order to restore him, he restores him three times.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.700]   Do you love me?
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.500]   Just as it was confirmed that he denied Christ, it is confirmed his love for him.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.820]   But you know what's interesting here?
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.260]   If he failed that exam to be loyal to Christ, you would think that that's what he would
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:34.220]   say, especially if he's going to be established to feed the sheep, right.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.760]   Now I'm going to go, you know.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.420]   When I was going to the cross, it was a test.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.740]   It was just a, you know, it wasn't a death test.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.500]   It wasn't a final test.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.820]   It was kind of like a quarter test.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.620]   It only counts for 10%.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.200]   Now this one's going to count for all your grade, right.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.580]   So you failed that time, so don't fail this time.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:58.500]   So when I leave, you better not deny me.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.380]   You would think that that's what Jesus would be asking.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.860]   Are you going to stay loyal?
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   Yes Lord.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.060]   You sure you're going to stay loyal?
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.100]   Yes Lord.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.460]   You better not fail.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.260]   You sure you're going to stay loyal?
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.460]   Because after I leave and you fall, James and John's going to fall.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.580]   Matthew for sure is going to fall, right.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.300]   Peter the zealot for sure is going to fall.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.180]   They're all going to fall, so you better get this right.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.660]   That's not what he says.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:39.700]   In order to establish him, to use him, the only thing that he checks is do you love me?
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.420]   Do you love me?
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.580]   Not are you going to fail me?
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   Are you sure you're going to be pure?
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.980]   Are you going to get your doctrines right?
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.260]   Are you sure you're going to be disciplined?
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.220]   Are you sure you know how to make disciples?
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.260]   Are you sure you're going to be holy?
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.260]   No you do you love me.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.580]   But not only does he ask him do you love me, he said do you love me more than these?
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.620]   So there's a debate as to what the these he's talking about.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.820]   So he obviously he was fishing, so he some people say he's talking point to the fish.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.980]   Right.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.340]   Do you love me more than sushi?
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.580]   Do you love me?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.580]   Right.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.140]   So some people thought that say like maybe that's one of the interpretation.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:30.500]   Another interpretation that because Jesus was referring to Peter's statement before
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:36.260]   he went to the cross, he said you know all of them are going to fail you but I will not.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.860]   So it could be that Jesus is pointing to the disciples and he said do you love me more
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.580]   than these guys here?
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.900]   They may fail me again, are you?
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.460]   I thought that that was a better interpretation.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:55.820]   But I think there's a reason why that's left ambiguous.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:01.300]   Because I don't think he was necessarily referring to one particular thing.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.460]   When he says these he's talking about everything else.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.380]   Which includes sushi.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.300]   Which includes the other companions.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.760]   Do you love me more than these?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.260]   More than anything else?
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.620]   And even your own life?
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.640]   I believe that that's what Jesus was asking him.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.180]   Because that's what God is pursuing with us.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.220]   He's not simply saving us so that we don't go to hell.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.220]   That in and of itself we should be praising God.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:43.380]   The fact that he knows our name alone should cause us to be all in worshiping God.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:50.220]   But he made us his son so that we can come into the inner chamber of God and call him
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.900]   our Abba Father to enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.580]   We become co-heirs with Christ.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:04.460]   He's not pursuing a proper legal standing in eternity.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.900]   He adopted us.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.660]   He loved us.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.540]   So we love him back.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.420]   Isn't that the greatest reward?
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.300]   Isn't that the greatest reward if you, you know, like people in our church are adopting
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.060]   children and we're very encouraged by that?
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.180]   The greatest reward of adopting a child is not he become an Olympic champion and he's
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.020]   going to, you know, one day I'm going to be famous because of this child.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.980]   Imagine the pressure that that child is under.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.900]   He's going to be a famous baseball star.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.500]   He's going to, you know, that he's going to found another Facebook and he's going to become
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   a millionaire.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.380]   Imagine if somebody actually adopted a child with that intent.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.580]   How that would ruin that child.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.700]   It would have been better for him to be orphaned.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:52.620]   The greatest reward that a child can give to parents who adopted him is what?
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.580]   To embrace his parents as his own.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:03.220]   To love them as much as they loved that child.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.920]   It's clear that that's what God is pursuing with us.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.900]   That's why even when Paul told Timothy to teach certain men not to teach false doctrines,
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.900]   he makes sure he qualifies that because he's sending him to battle and he says, but the
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.260]   goal of this instruction is love.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.180]   Love.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:25.900]   Not simple purity, not simple doctrinal correctness.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   Is love.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.940]   To make sure that when you enter into this battle, that you examine yourself.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.860]   You make sure that this goal, the end product of it isn't simply we got the right doctrine,
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.540]   we're doing the right thing, we're organized a certain way, but that what comes out of
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.620]   that is greater love.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:50.460]   You know, I'm starting to get at that age where one by one my close friends that I have,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.420]   who had children a little bit before me, are starting to have kids who are getting married.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.860]   And then some of them, a few of them, are starting to have grandkids.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860]   You know?
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   So it's surreal.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.820]   It's kind of like when we first got married, we'd say, you know, we were young and say,
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.980]   who's going to get married first?
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.740]   And well, that person got married, this person got married.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.940]   So I have roommates and I have friends that we've known for a long time and now, you
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.620]   know, their kids are a little bit older, they're in their mid to late 20s and so then now they're
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.620]   having kids.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   So I asked him, so what is it like being a grandparent?
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.620]   You know?
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.300]   And he said, most of the time, just awesome.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.300]   Right?
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   So what's different?
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   He said, man, when we were parents, we were so busy raising the kids that we didn't enjoy
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.340]   them.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.660]   Now we just enjoy them.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:42.580]   He said, we love them just as much, we love our grandkids as much as we love our own children,
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:49.860]   but we didn't enjoy our kids like we enjoy the grandkids.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:57.740]   So much of what we do as Christians, we get so wrapped up in trying to be good Christians
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.660]   and we miss the whole point of why God saved us.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.620]   We get caught up in trying to fix the church, not realizing the church is a gift to us to
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.700]   enjoy.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.940]   We get so caught up preaching the gospel that we don't celebrate the gospel.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.660]   We get so caught up in trying to make godly marriages that we don't actually enjoy the
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.780]   marriage.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:30.620]   We work so hard to be obedient and follow God that we don't actually enjoy God and worship
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.380]   God.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:39.540]   He came to give life and to give life abundantly.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:46.300]   The best way to thank God is to enjoy the life that he has given us and to love him
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.180]   in response.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.180]   And so church is an avenue for us to do that.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   Fellowship is to remind us to do that.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:57.880]   We study the word of God so that that would take us so that we can love God.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.660]   But if we're not careful, we can make all that God has given us, just like the Pharisees
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.860]   made the Sabbath.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:10.220]   Be burdened by the church, burdened by the fellowship, burdened by commands.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:17.860]   And if the central thing that you and I have fallen short of is the glory of God, shouldn't
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.540]   the primary thing that God restores is his glory?
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.020]   To be in all of his glory.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.700]   I mean, that guy really loves God.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.300]   That lady really loves God.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   What happened?
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.180]   What is it about God that he would love God that much?
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:47.500]   But if we're not careful, we make idols of the gift that God has given us and we give
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:54.940]   so much of our energy, hope into the crutch that God may have given so that we can walk
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.940]   better.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.700]   And then now that has become a burden.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:06.300]   See, Isaac, he loved more than anything else.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.660]   But remember the covenant that God made with Abraham was not to be burdensome because God
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.580]   gave it to him unilaterally.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.580]   It was a gift.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:23.020]   You know, when two people get married, the Christian answer that we give, for the glory
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.820]   of God, two are better than one.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   We work better.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.460]   But you know, you put two horses together, they work harder.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.700]   Right?
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.620]   So we're yoked for God's work.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:43.980]   And that's the answer that we give because we're programmed to give theologically correct
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   answers.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.340]   But if you ask people, like, "Why do you get married?"
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.740]   He's like, "She's pretty."
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.740]   Right?
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.300]   "Don't act godly."
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.300]   Right?
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.500]   "Give me a real answer."
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   You like the way she looked, the way she tied her ponytail, like the way she smells.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   And she happened to love Jesus.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   Right?
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.740]   You get married because you want to get married.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.220]   You were never burdened to get married.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.660]   You get married because you want to get married.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.300]   You want to because you're happy when you're with her.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.700]   You'd rather be with her than your smelly friends.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.980]   God gave Eve to Adam, right, as a gift.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.080]   God gave the church to us as a gift.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.980]   God gave our salvation as a gift.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.300]   And instead of thanking him and loving him for what the gift that he's given, we are
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:53.900]   so busy trying to get it right and completely forget the central reason why he saved us,
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.260]   to enjoy him and to glorify him forever.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:05.540]   That's why he's tested, to make sure that his faith is founded upon his word, that our
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.220]   greatest love is where we get the greatest joy.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
