[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   A lot of you from CCM and I have good friends also here attending this church.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.800]   So it's really great that I'm able to minister the Word of God to you.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.120]   Let me begin with the word of prayer and we'll get right into it.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:26.200]   God, we come here this morning because we love you.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.720]   We come together this morning as a church, as a group of believers, as a people who have
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.840]   been redeemed by your blood and brought into your body, adopted into the family.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.440]   We come here to recognize your goodness, to worship you for your grace and for your mercy
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   and just to sit at your feet as you teach us your Word.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.120]   And so I pray that as the truth goes forth that Lord, Holy Spirit, would you work in
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.240]   each of our hearts, take that truth, convict us with it.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.320]   And Lord, this week and the week after and our entire life, may we just live worshipfully
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   unto you.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.400]   I pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.360]   Alright so this past weekend what we've been doing is talking about the Great Commission
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   and for you Collegians, you guys should remember, we set our eyes on the glory of God.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.080]   We set our eyes on the glory of God and why we evangelize.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.760]   We evangelize ultimately for the glory of God and then Saturday morning we kind of brought
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   things to ourselves.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.160]   In order for us to go forward and to proclaim the Gospel effectively, unashamedly, we have
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.800]   to be dead men.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   Because the world can't do anything to dead people and the world hates God, the world
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.000]   hates Christianity, the world hates the Gospel.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And so they're going to come after you.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.840]   In order for you to go into the world effectively, unashamedly, willing to endure the pain, you
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.680]   have to be dead men.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.000]   And then last night we talked about the peril of hell.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.720]   We brought the focus from the Lord and we kind of understood the Gospel with respect
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   to ourselves.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720]   Then we try to understand it with regards to other people.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.000]   The peril of hell, people are going to be damned because they don't hear the Gospel.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.240]   So Collegians, we are believers who believe in the reality of heaven and hell so that
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.920]   people who do not hear the Gospel will be damned.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   We all believe that.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.240]   And if we fervently believe in that truth, then we will go out and proclaim the truth
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.560]   that will deliver them from that hell.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.920]   Today what I want to do is to bring the focus back to God.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   And to talk about the very motivation that pushes us and compels us to share the Gospel.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.120]   I want to read to you from Isaiah chapter 6.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:03:07.920]   So take your Bibles and turn with me to Isaiah chapter 6.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   Isaiah chapter 6.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.120]   It reads this from verse 1 through 7.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.040]   In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   up.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.280]   And the train of His robe filled the temple.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920]   Above Him stood the seraphim.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.120]   Each had six wings.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.880]   With two He covered His face and with two He covered His feet.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.040]   And with two He flew.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.320]   And one called to another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.280]   The whole earth is full of His glory."
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.400]   The foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of Him who called and the house
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   was filled with smoke.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.480]   And I said, "Woe is me, for I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   the midst of a people of unclean lips.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.560]   For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.280]   with tongs from the altar.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.920]   And he touched my mouth and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.360]   Your guilt has taken away your sins atoned for."
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.400]   I mean, this is an amazing vision that the prophet Isaiah goes through.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.320]   He, I don't know how it happened, just opens his eyes and he's before the throne of God.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.360]   He's before the throne of God, before the presence of God and he is watching and he
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.640]   is beholding the outpouring of the very essence of God's fearsome glory.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.960]   And he hears the seraphim praising the Lord for His holiness with their angelic voices.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.840]   They're filling the chambers of God with the melody of worship.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.720]   He sees them veiling their faces because even the angels cannot directly look upon the glory
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.200]   of their King.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   All the while he hears a divine voice thunder through the hall of God's holy throne and
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.560]   he feels the foundations of the threshold shake.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.640]   When you're in the presence of God, you're not nonchalant.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.240]   Undoubtedly, he fell down and he worshiped and he says, "Woe is me.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.520]   Woe is me.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.280]   For I'm a man of unclean lips who live among men of unclean lips and I have beheld God
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.760]   almighty but God, when He looks upon this man, this sinful, depraved man, He doesn't
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.200]   crush him.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.120]   He doesn't destroy him but He commissions an angel and the angel goes and takes the
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   coal, takes it and presses it upon the mouth of Isaiah and the lips of this prophet is
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.320]   cleansed."
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.840]   And then it says in verse 8, "I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   and who will go for us?'
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.160]   Then I said, 'Here I am.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.360]   Send me.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.000]   I will go.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.880]   I will go and do what you want me to do.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.760]   I will go and say what you want me to say.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   I will go wherever you want me to go.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.280]   I will go for you who has atoned for my sins.'"
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:11.000]   And Isaiah is commissioned and he goes, "Do you know why we go out and evangelize?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.440]   It's to magnify and to proclaim the glory of the one who has cleansed us of our sins.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.640]   As our Lord God has taken the hot coal of the gospel of Jesus Christ and touched our
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.200]   mouth and He has forgiven us, He has cleansed our soul.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.720]   And with the authority of heaven and earth, the Lord Jesus Christ commissioned everybody
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.120]   who has been redeemed."
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   Hence everybody here.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.760]   "He has commissioned every single person who has been redeemed from their sins and delivered
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.240]   from the damnation of hell.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.860]   He has commissioned you as the Lord of the heavens and the earth, go and make disciples
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.340]   of all the nations.
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.620]   At this point you either defy that command or you submit in worship."
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:56.140]   But unlike Isaiah who was commissioned to proclaim judgment, we are commissioned to
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.540]   proclaim salvation.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.780]   If you tell people of the very love that has saved us, we are a people who have been forgiven
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.500]   by the grace of God.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.880]   We are the people whose lips have been cleansed by the coal of the gospel.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:22.100]   And because we have been redeemed, the love that you have for God, the joy of forgiveness,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.860]   the relationship you have with the Lord should be what propels you to move forward to proclaim
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.660]   the message that He has given to you.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.460]   And that message is the message of the joy of salvation in Christ.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.700]   And today what I basically want to do is to kind of, I just want to bring us back to the
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   gospel.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.820]   Bring us back to what Jesus Christ went through.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.340]   And that we would be affected and impressed by it.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.060]   So that we too, like Isaiah would say, "Here I am, send me."
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:13.380]   Turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 27 and we'll get into the text.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:25.260]   Matthew chapter 27.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.100]   As we go through this text, this is Jesus.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100]   It's about Jesus.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.340]   It's about the one we love.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.140]   It's about the one whom we worship.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:42.100]   And this is very personal to every single one of you.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.740]   Matthew chapter 27 verse 27.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.700]   "And the soldiers of the governors took Jesus into the governor's headquarters."
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.540]   Soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:09:01.620]   You have to remember our Lord, before He was taken by the Roman soldiers, He was abused.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.460]   He was beaten by the temple police.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.580]   He had lacerations across His back because of the discouraging He received by the Romans.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.540]   He was in a condition where He was bleeding and He was hurt.
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.940]   And it was in that condition that the Roman soldiers took the Lord Jesus Christ and just
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.940]   threw Him into the praetorium, into the governor's household.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.420]   And it says here, "And they gathered the whole battalion before Him."
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.460]   Sometimes we think just a few soldiers came around Jesus Christ to kind of have fun with
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.460]   Him.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.740]   But it says here, an entire battalion, the whole battalion came before Him.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.740]   A battalion consisted of approximately 600 Roman soldiers.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.800]   That's what a cohort was.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.100]   Approximately 600 Roman soldiers heard about this man, the King of the Jews, Jesus the
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.540]   Christ, and they come and they surround Him.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540]   600 soldiers.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.740]   And it says in verse 28 to 30, "And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.140]   And twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head and put a reed in His right
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.140]   hand.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.020]   And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.820]   They spit on Him and took the reed and struck Him on the head.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.700]   They took the Lord Jesus Christ, they took off His clothes, and they exposed Himself
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.700]   in shame.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.220]   And they put upon Him a scarlet robe."
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.860]   Probably something, one of the robes that the soldiers were wearing, because that's
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.860]   what they had at the time.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.260]   "They put it upon Him to make Him look like a king.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.820]   The soldiers twisted thorns together to give the King a crown that is worthy of His title.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.180]   They took a reed, something that they used to flog their victim.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.980]   They took a reed and put it in His right hand, His glorious scepter."
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.860]   What you see is a pathetic, pitiful picture of our Lord Jesus Christ, bruised, beaten,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   and He's bleeding.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.900]   There's a fake crown on His head.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.340]   There's a robe across Him and a stupid stick in His hand.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.820]   This is the picture of your King.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.540]   "They looked upon this man and they bowed down.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.260]   They bowed down and they gave Him the same praise that they will give Caesar.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.540]   'Hail, hail, King of the Jews!
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.940]   Hail, hail, King of the Jews!'
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.140]   They noticed that they spat on them."
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.220]   That's what the text says, "They, they spat on them."
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.500]   Multiple people.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.100]   Everyone who was within the proximity of Jesus Christ, oh, they showered Him, but not with
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.540]   praise but with their saliva.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.620]   And they took the reed and it says, "The reed," referring to the reed in Jesus' hand, and
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.300]   they took that to beat Him with it.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.700]   You know, these guys could have taken anything to beat the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.500]   They could beat Him with their hands.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.980]   They could have beat Him with some other weapon.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.980]   They could have taken another reed and started beating the Lord Jesus, but they took the
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.460]   reed in His right hand, the scepter, and started beating Him across the head.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.620]   The scepter of a king represented his regal power and authority.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.380]   For them to take the scepter to beat Christ was to beat Him with his own authority.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.740]   It's kind of like a bully who grabs the wrist of a little child and starts slapping him
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.100]   across the face with it.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.380]   Not only makes him look weak, but also makes him look like an incompetent fool, unable
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.380]   to control himself.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.020]   It's not just a hurt, it was a shame.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.220]   That's exactly what these soldiers did.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.380]   They took the wrist of Jesus' power and authority and began slapping Him across the face.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.180]   Here's the king of the Jews, unable to control his very own authority and power.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:28.900]   And that verb "struck," in the Greek, it's, we say, in the imperfect tense meaning.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.100]   And the reason why I bring that out is because that imperfect tense portrays an ongoing action
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   in the past.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.980]   They constantly beat Him over and over again.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.500]   "Hail, king of the Jews!"
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.060]   And they beat Him, and they beat Him, and they beat Him.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:51.020]   They drove the thorns that were on His head deeper and deeper into a skull.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:13:01.100]   Six, approximately 600 grown men, just mocking this man.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.140]   Verse 31.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.380]   Or verse 20, uh, 31.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.540]   When they had mocked Him, when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.620]   His own clothes on Him and led Him away to crucify Him.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.660]   Almost everybody had their fill of fun.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.420]   They took the robe off and put His own clothes back on Him.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.460]   And they made Jesus carry the cross.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.940]   Approximately 200 pounds, carry the cross.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:37.580]   And took the cross upon His shoulders and He began to walk.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.300]   But when He made it to the outside of the gates, He could not hold it anymore.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.260]   And it says in verse 32, "And they went out and they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.500]   They compelled the man to carry his cross.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:53.060]   The Lord unable to carry the cross upon which he will die, the soldiers got a man to carry
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   it for Him.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.060]   So together they went.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:01.740]   It was a Roman soldiers, Simon of Cyrene, and Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.220]   They came to a place called Golgotha.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.940]   Verse 33, 34 it says, "And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means place
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.380]   of a skull, they offered Him wine to drink mixed with gall.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.380]   But when He tasted it, He would not drink it."
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.900]   Now the word Calvary is where we get the word Calvary from the reference here.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.500]   Golgotha is a place of a skull.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.300]   And we don't know exactly why it's referred to in this way, but a traditional site is
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.660]   called Gordon's Calvary, which is north of the city walls of Jerusalem, which kind of
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.540]   looks like a skull.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.500]   And the word Calvary is taken from the Latin word for skull, it's calvaria, which is where
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.980]   we get the word cranium from.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:47.540]   So Calvary is in reference to the hill, Golgotha, the place of the skull.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   So when Jesus came to Calvary, the soldiers gave Him a drink.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.700]   They gave Him a drink.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.300]   A drink of wine mixed with gall.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.520]   Now gall is just a general term referring to something that is bitter.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.860]   The book of Mark tells us that this gall is myrrh.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:07.300]   And what myrrh does is heightens the strength of a drink so as to deaden the pain.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.940]   So they gave this to Jesus Christ, but they didn't give it to the Lord because they wanted
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.940]   to be merciful.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.220]   They felt bad about Him.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.300]   I mean, look at what they did to Him before.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.380]   The reason why they gave Him this drink is because they didn't want Him to squirm when
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.760]   they were going to nail Him to the cross.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.300]   They wanted to stupefy Him.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   So after tasting it, Jesus spat it out.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.380]   He spat it out because He wanted to, He didn't want any of the senses to be dulled.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.340]   He wanted to make sure that He felt the fullness of God's wrath when it came upon Him.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.020]   That He will feel every ounce of damnation.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.900]   That He will feel every ounce of pain and torment.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:49.700]   He made sure He was sober so that He will understand the horrors of hell.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:55.500]   Verse 35 and 36.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.980]   When they had crucified Him, they divided His garment among them by casting lots.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.180]   Then they sat down and kept watch over Him there.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.620]   It's very interesting.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.860]   This is the only place where Matthew really talks about the crucifixion.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.860]   He just says that He was crucified.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.300]   He doesn't get into the details of the pain.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.940]   He doesn't talk about how victims die by suffocating to death.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.940]   He just says He was crucified.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.060]   The word crucify is not even the main verb of the sentence.
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.620]   He's crucified.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.540]   Matthew's focus is not so much on the pain that Jesus Christ had to endure, but the shame
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.140]   that He had to endure.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.700]   The book of Mark tells us that He was crucified at the third hour, which is nine o'clock in
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.700]   the morning.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.140]   The first hour is at six o'clock.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.540]   When the soldiers crucified Jesus at that time, they divided up His garment among themselves
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.860]   and they began to gamble it away.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.860]   Now what does that imply?
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.780]   It implies they stripped Jesus of His clothes.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.300]   It implies that they stripped Jesus of His clothes.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.620]   The Romans, when they crucified the criminals, they crucified them naked.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:00.120]   Now it's possible for Jews they left loincloth so that they wouldn't violate some kind of
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.300]   Jewish stipulation that we find later on in the Mishnah.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.340]   But when you think about Jesus, when you think about Jesus' condemnation, the religious leaders
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.060]   were willing to make an exception to their traditions and to their rules and to their
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.060]   regulations.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.740]   When it came to Jesus, when it came to mocking Him, condemning Him, they were willing to
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.380]   make an exception.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.100]   So it's very possible when our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified upon that cross, He was
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.420]   crucified completely naked.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:36.580]   He was lifted up for the entire world to see His glory.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.980]   And above His head was His crime and over His head they put the charge against Him which
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.740]   read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.440]   This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.400]   And what king would exercise His royal power without His right and left hand man, right?
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.860]   And so what does it say in verse 38?
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.320]   "Then two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left."
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.760]   You see the King in all His glory.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.000]   See the King with His majestic crown.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.040]   See the King with His splendid garments.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.120]   See the King with His right and left hand man.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.240]   See the King upon His glorious throne.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.840]   This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:19.120]   Our Lord was lifted up on the cross and shamed and mocked for everyone, by everyone, for
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.920]   being someone who He really was.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.960]   Verse 39 and 40.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.520]   And those who passed by derided Him, wagging their heads and saying, "You who would destroy
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.320]   the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.280]   If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.840]   He was lifted up on the cross and people began to pass by and they looked upon this man and
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   they began mocking him.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.440]   It was time of the Passover so there were a lot of Jewish pilgrims going into Jerusalem.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.740]   But because the city could not hold every guest, they had to station themselves outside
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.740]   of the city.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.160]   There was a lot of foot traffic going in and outside of Jerusalem.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.860]   And as they were going by, as they were walking by, they look and here's the man.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.120]   He was the man, the guy who claimed to be the King of the Jews.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.640]   The one who said he would destroy the temple, rebuild it in three days.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.520]   The one who deceived the masses into thinking that he was the Son of God.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.880]   They look upon this man, "Here, this was the King of the Jews."
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.240]   And they said, they began to mock him.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   "You who are going to destroy the temple, rebuild it in three days, why don't you save
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240]   yourself?
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.440]   Save yourself, the Son of God, why don't you come down from that cross?"
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.880]   They didn't just say it once, but that word saying again in perfect tense, saying that
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.080]   they kept on saying this, "You who are about to, you who can destroy the temple and rebuild
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.560]   it in three days, save yourself if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:47.240]   Man, they mercilessly mocked Jesus Christ.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.280]   They knew nothing of what happened to him.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   They didn't know about the betrayal, they didn't know about the abandonment, they didn't
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.400]   know about the kangaroo trial, they didn't know about the unjust condemnation, they didn't
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.320]   know about the ridicule and the beating.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.960]   They were just walking by, passing by, passerby.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.840]   And they just felt like mocking him.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.180]   Merciless.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.880]   But they weren't the only ones.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   Verse 41.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.600]   So also the chief priests and the scribes and the elders mocked him, saying, "See, he
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.080]   saved others, he cannot save himself.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.280]   He is the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   him.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.200]   He trusts in God, let God deliver him now if he desires him, for he says, 'I am the
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.720]   Son of God.'"
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   Unlike those who were passing by, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders, man,
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.520]   they didn't talk to Jesus to his face.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.360]   They wouldn't talk to a criminal directly.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.040]   They were above that.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.000]   They were religious, they were holy, they were righteous.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.760]   They would not dare desecrate themselves by talking with a criminal hanging upon a cross.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.080]   Cursed is the man who hangs upon a tree.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.960]   So they talked amongst each other.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.560]   But ensuring the fact that Jesus Christ heard every word of it.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.740]   He saved others, he saved others, he cannot save himself.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.200]   He fed the hungry, he healed the crippled, he healed the sick, he made the blind see,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   he made the deaf hear, he made the mute speak, he healed the leper, he resurrected men from
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   the dead.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   Others he saved, but himself he cannot.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.440]   And this is the king, that's what it says, right?
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.400]   The king, not a king.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.040]   And this is the king, the king of Israel.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.440]   The one we have been waiting for since the days of the exile.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.840]   The one who was going to usher in the kingdom of God.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.680]   The one who was going to eradicate the Romans.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.720]   The one who was going to usher in glory and power.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.880]   The one who was going to rule with a rod of iron.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.240]   This is the king, the son of David.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.480]   Let him come down, then we will believe in him.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.280]   If you want to seriously hurt somebody, you never attack the individual alone.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.320]   You go after the relationship that they cherish, right?
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.140]   You want to hurt somebody.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.560]   You don't just go after the man, you just don't go after the woman.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.880]   You go after the relationship that they treasure.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.600]   You want to mess with the mind of a husband, you convince him that his wife committed adultery.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.400]   You want to mess with the mind of a parent, you tell them that the kid got into an accident.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.960]   You want to mess with the mind of a kid, you tell them that the parents abandoned him.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.160]   If you want to hurt somebody, you don't just simply go after the person, you go after the
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.520]   relationship that they cherish.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.240]   And that is exactly what they did.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.880]   It was Jesus Christ, the one who spoke the words of God, the one who always did the work
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.360]   of the Father, the one who said that he was one with God.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.920]   He trusts in God.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.080]   Let God rescue him now.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.720]   If he delights in him, for he says, "I am the son of God."
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.040]   This man truly had a relationship with God.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.880]   Then let God rescue him, let God deliver him, lest God does not want to, lest God's favor
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.720]   is not upon him, lest God has abandoned him.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   The moment you think that everyone possible could have mocked Jesus Christ and shamed
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.320]   him, two robbers join in on the fun, verse 44.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:55.680]   The robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.400]   The two criminals were mocking Jesus in the same way as those passing by and the religious
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.200]   leaders, but their insults and abuse were more shameful, simply because they were criminals.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.280]   The degree of an insult doesn't depend upon the content of the insult, but also on the
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.080]   individual who gives it.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:18.520]   For example, my professor can insult me, and I would be offended.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.000]   And he can insult my intelligence, and I'd be offended.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.760]   But a high school student can insult my intelligence, and I'd be even more offended, because he's
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.200]   a high school kid.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.840]   Brings my intellect below his high school education.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.520]   Here are these criminals next to Jesus Christ, rejects, moral delinquents, socially unacceptable,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.320]   basically a menace.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.440]   They're men deserving of death.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.640]   Men who do not deserve to live.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.400]   And they took Jesus Christ, the glorious God of the heavens and the earth, and brought
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.260]   him below to make him the object of their insults.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.760]   They brought the status and the prominence of the great king below their death-deserving
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760]   lives.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.400]   In Luke chapter 27, verse 44, Luke tells us that one of the criminals said this, "Are
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.720]   you not the Christ?
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.280]   Save yourself and us.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.840]   This fool makes a demand upon the king of kings as if he's in a position to make such
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.400]   a demand."
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.720]   And they continually did it.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.000]   They continually reviled him.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.280]   In perfect tense, they continually hurled insults at him.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:22.680]   You who are the king, you who are the Messiah, you who are the anointed one, the Christ,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   prove it.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.040]   Save yourself and save us.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   All throughout the account of the crucifixion, Matthew records and takes note of the shame
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   of Christ.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.240]   He was despised by the Roman soldiers.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.000]   He was despised by those passing by.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.680]   He was despised by the religious leaders.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.800]   He was despised by the criminals on his right and his left.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.440]   But up until now, none of those things really mattered compared to what was going to happen.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:55.160]   As terrible and shameful as that was, it didn't matter compared to what was going to happen.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.480]   Verse 45 and 46.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.600]   "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.120]   About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying, 'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.280]   that is my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'"
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.800]   The first hour of the day begins at six o'clock in the morning.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.720]   And so, as we remember, Mark tells us that he was crucified at the third hour, that is
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   nine o'clock.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.320]   Twelve o'clock in the afternoon, a supernatural darkness falls upon the land.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.840]   A darkness that lasts until the ninth hour, that is three o'clock.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.320]   Between twelve to three o'clock, there is a supernatural darkness upon the earth.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:38.080]   And this darkness is no other than the manifestation of the fierce presence of God Almighty.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.240]   It is the manifestation of the presence of God Almighty.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.120]   Deuteronomy chapter 5, verse 22 to 23.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.160]   It says, "These words of the Lord spoke to all the assembly at the mountain out of the
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.520]   mist of the fire.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.920]   The cloud and the thick darkness with a loud voice and he added, 'No more.'
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.720]   And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.080]   And as soon as you heard the voice out of the mist of the darkness, while the mountains
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.000]   was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.320]   Second Samuel chapter 22, verse 8 to 14 says, "Then the earth reeled and rocked the foundations
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.000]   of heaven and trembled and quaked because he was angry.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.280]   Smoke went up from his nostrils and devouring fire from his mouth, glowing coals flamed
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.360]   forth from him.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.680]   He bowed the heavens and came down.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.400]   Thick darkness was under his feet.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.000]   He rode on a chair then flew.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.640]   He was seen on the wings of the wind.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.880]   He made darkness around him, his canopy.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.000]   Thick clouds, a gathering of water out of the brightness before him, coals of fire flamed
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   forth.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.160]   The Lord thundered from heaven and the Most High uttered his voice.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.440]   Upon the land, God Almighty made his presence manifest and darkness encompassed the sacred
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.840]   and yet the forsaken hill.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.720]   The earth was enveloped in fierce and terrible canopy of God's judgment.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   And at the ninth hour, out from that darkness, out from that horrific blackness, a terrifying
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:07.200]   voice pierced the air, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:15.040]   In the words of Sproul, it was the cry of the damned.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.640]   Implications of the question along with the answer is obvious.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.000]   God the Father forsook the Son.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.840]   That's why Jesus Christ didn't say, "My Father, my Father," but he said, "My God, my God."
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   He said, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.920]   The reason why the Father forsook the Son is because God cannot look upon sin.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.720]   Habakkuk chapter 1 verse 13 says, "You who are pure eyes and to see evil and cannot look
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   at wrong."
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.120]   God can't approve sin.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   He can't look upon sin.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   He can't tolerate sin.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.340]   He can't excuse sin.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:55.520]   And upon that cross, Jesus, who knew no sin, was being made sin on our behalf.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.660]   Upon this cross, he was being made a curse because curse is one who hangs upon a tree.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.800]   Upon that cross, he was bearing upon himself that which God hated with the deepest hate.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.720]   Every shameful sin, every sin that you have committed, the sins you have entertained in
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.320]   your mind, the sins that you are too afraid to share with others, the sin that you harbor
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.960]   and keep secret, the sin that weighs you down with guilt and burdens you, that shameful
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.600]   sin was placed upon the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and fully exposed in his nakedness
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.880]   before the presence of God.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   He bore your shame.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.860]   And for the first time ever, the Father looked upon his beloved Son.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.760]   He looked upon the Son whom he has loved for all of eternity and he turned away in disgust.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.560]   He was repulsed by all that was upon him.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.520]   So by this time, nothing mattered to Christ.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.280]   The insults of the soldiers didn't matter.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   The insults of those passing by didn't matter.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.600]   The insults of those of the religious leaders didn't matter.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.920]   The insults of the criminals on the right and the left didn't matter.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.240]   The only thing that mattered was the intimacy with the Father.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   The only thing that mattered was the relationship that they had for all of eternity.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.040]   The only thing that mattered was the Father's affection for him.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.400]   The only thing that mattered was that relationship.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.120]   And so when sin was poured out upon Jesus Christ, he looked to the heavens and he said,
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:21.080]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.600]   But Jesus Christ knew the answer.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:33.200]   It's so that God would not have to forsake you.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.280]   And so that he would not have to forsake you.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:46.720]   And you, and you, and you, and all of us here.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.600]   You see everything that you read just now?
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.040]   It was for you.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.960]   For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son to experience the shame
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:07.560]   of this world, to bear our sins, and to go to the cross and to die on our behalf.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.240]   And to resurrect from the dead so that he may take the coal of the gospel and touch
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.280]   your lips and cleanse you from all your sins.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.880]   Our God, our Lord Jesus Christ died a shameful death so that you can live.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.400]   This is the coal that has touched your lips.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:37.200]   Now will you go and proclaim the gospel to bring him glory?
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.600]   Whom shall I send and who will go for us?
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.280]   Let all those who have tasted the goodness of God's grace, who have tasted his mercy,
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.680]   who have tasted his love and the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, with one voice say,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.760]   "Here I am.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.760]   Send me."
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:01.000]   Let's pray.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.200]   Lord, the gospel can never get old.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.360]   It can never become boring.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.200]   Because we know that everything that Jesus Christ went through, Matthew chapter 27, it
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.040]   was done for the sake of our salvation, ultimately for your glory.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   Lord, we did not deserve it.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.880]   We could not have earned it.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.560]   And yet you did it, Lord.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:38.040]   And I pray for us as Christians, I pray for Berean.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.880]   I pray for this church that, God, this truth of the gospel would impact our hearts day
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.080]   to day, that we would be moved by it, that we would be gripped by it.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.600]   I know there are so many things that we're busy with, so many things that distract us,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.400]   so many things that get in the way.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.040]   And we know that they're not necessarily bad things.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.920]   But Lord, I pray that these things would not blind us from what we are ultimately called
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.600]   to do.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:09.120]   And that is to glorify you through the gospel.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.680]   Impress this truth upon their hearts.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:18.720]   And Lord, with their life, be one that gives you great pleasure.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.640]   God, you have redeemed us by the blood of the Son.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:30.040]   We pray for the grace, pray for the mercy and strength that we would be able to go out
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.720]   and make known to the world of the one who has lifted us up from damnation.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.280]   We love you, would you increase our love.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.640]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   Thanks for watching! <3
