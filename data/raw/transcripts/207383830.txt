[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   So, as we look at our passage, we see that actually connection to previous thought, connection
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.840]   to previous passages, the idea and theme remains that this major exhortation to be able to
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.080]   submit is a running theme in this passage, right?
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.240]   We saw that if you just take a look at your Bibles all the way from chapter 2, that the
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.520]   idea of submission runs from verse 13, that you need to submit yourselves for the Lord's
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.720]   sake to human institutions, governors, all this kind of stuff.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.400]   Then in verse 18, he asked that servants, so whether it be slaves to masters, and I
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.000]   kind of expanded out to workers and et cetera, you need to learn how to submit.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.280]   And then there was this huge exhortation that we need to do this for the sake of Christ.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480]   And then here we are with this idea of submission in the home.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   But if you ask how, you know, in terms of the connection of the thought, the flow of
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.120]   this actually started way back in chapter 1, verse 13.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.720]   When we saw that in chapter 1, that there was a huge kind of push for us to remember
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.560]   and appreciate the salvation that we have, chapter 1, verse 13 made the transition, made
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.240]   the flip and said, "This is how you start to apply."
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.160]   And the reason why I bring that up is with 1 Peter, there is a overarching, big umbrella
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.080]   theme that how we apply the gospel in our lives is learning how to surrender and submit
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.620]   in various applications, various circumstances of our lives, right?
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.240]   Quite surprising.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.000]   And I said how this book for me has been a challenge to my expectations, a challenge
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   to what I view as normal, right?
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080]   The challenge to what I view as acceptable in our response to difficulty, suffering,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   and persecution.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.200]   And that's really also what's going to be the case for chapter 3, verses 1 through 7.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.780]   That in terms of the situation that maybe can be found in the home, practically speaking,
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780]   what is going to be the application of the gospel?
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.860]   The gospel has to work itself out.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.300]   The faith that we have has to express itself.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.380]   It's not only going to be just in the moment of salvation, but in the home too, the regular
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.540]   experiences of our lives.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.220]   He says, "This is what I expect of you," for the Christian, okay?
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.820]   So reading verse 1 through 2 again, let's read it and I'll read it for us.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:51.220]   It says, "In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if any
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.300]   of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.700]   of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior."
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.260]   If I were to just do a simple summary and outline of this passage, I would just make
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.980]   it this four-point outline that I have there.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.820]   There is a command, the main point, be submissive.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.780]   There is a clear, "so that" the non-believers may be won.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.140]   There is a means or the content of how you're going to apply that.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.980]   It says, "By the behavior and character of your life."
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.620]   And then there's an example, "Just like Sarah and holy women of the past."
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.340]   So this is actually a nice, what you call a pericope.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.460]   It's like a nice section that you can take and say, "Hmm, there's just this nice flow
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.940]   of thought in the outline."
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.420]   There's the command, the punch, boom, you need to be submissive.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.140]   And then there's the supporting ideas, giving you both the rationale and the purpose, the
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.460]   means and the example of how we're to do that.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.900]   So as I was thinking about this, I could have just followed the same line of thought and
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.420]   went through it.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.620]   But you know how in volleyball, there's like serve, bump, set, and then spike?
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.180]   So I was hoping that maybe we can just kind of flip it around.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.860]   In terms of giving you the example first, saying this is the example of how God is seeing
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.340]   what women should be like, and then the means by which they're going to achieve, and then
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.780]   et cetera, et cetera, down to the command.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.260]   So I'm going to reorder it and kind of work backwards for the section on the ladies.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.420]   So let's jump to verse five, verse five and six, and look at the example.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.540]   So this is the example for you to follow.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.500]   He says, "For in this way in former times, the holy women also who hoped in God used
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.900]   Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, and you have become her children if
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.260]   you do what is right without being frightened by any fear."
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.060]   So the example for you to follow is to be this holy woman, just as they were in the
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.300]   past.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.460]   And if I were to give a sermon title for this, I would just call it Be Holy Woman.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.500]   But what's more, there is just these running themes about what they did that will really
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.220]   challenge us.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.020]   First, what did these holy women do?
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.260]   It says that they hoped in God.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.460]   As an example of what you should mimic, it says that they placed their hope in God.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.020]   Now as we think about this, I ask this question, what does hope have to do with this command
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.700]   to submit?
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.100]   Right?
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.660]   Now as we think about that for a moment, how does hope relate to this command to submit?
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.780]   Right?
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.100]   We get actually one of the greatest things that's going to be the solution for every
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.340]   scenario of our lives.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.100]   Isn't hope that thing which really is synonymous with faith that caused every single individual
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.660]   in Hebrews chapter 11 to be able to do what they did?
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.060]   Isn't hope what they possessed in their heart that encouraged them to both suffer, to have
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.780]   loss of their possession, and continue to persevere even in the midst of all their suffering?
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.860]   Hope is actually so tied to any kind of difficulty, any act and application of our faith, that
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.020]   hope is what's revealed when we continue to do things like submit.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.900]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.180]   The evidence that we have hope is the application of submitting, enduring, and continuing to
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.760]   press on even in the circumstances that we find ourselves in.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.900]   So think about this for a moment.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.980]   The woman that he is speaking to, specifically on a circumstance that could be incredibly
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.980]   difficult.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.340]   What is that namely?
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.180]   He calls out that these are women who potentially are wives to unbelieving husbands.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.620]   Not only is it just simply unbelieving, but says they're disobedient to the word.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.720]   Now in relation, I just want to ask this question, in relation to various things that can go
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.180]   wrong in your life, where would that measure?
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.740]   Now it's kind of like a, I guess you can say a messed up question to ask.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.940]   It's like, "Dang, you know?
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.300]   Are we trying to, what if there was somebody in here who was, you know?
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300]   What if?
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300]   What if we knew people?"
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.700]   It's like, "Yeah, you're married to an unbelieving husband."
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.620]   And the reason why I ask that is because we have to kind of put ourselves in their shoes
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.220]   and realize that however bad we might think that it is today, that in their time, being
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.980]   married to an unbelieving husband could have been so detrimental to the well-being of their
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.980]   lives.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.340]   I mean, already they lived in a culture where women was seen as a possession.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.780]   Already they lived in a culture where men had the right to do whatever they wanted to
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.660]   their wives.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.060]   To the degree that if they believed that the wife has sinned or committed some kind of
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.500]   offense worthy, the husband could execute her.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.420]   So if this man is an unbelieving individual, think of the situation they find themselves
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.420]   in.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.420]   Right?
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:26.300]   And the reason why I say, then in that moment, in that moment, their ability to continue
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:32.460]   on shows and proves they have a hope greater than just in their circumstance.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460]   Right?
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.260]   Just as every single disappointing moment that we could potentially have in this life
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.860]   with some sense you're young to when you're older, whether it be you're hoping that you'll
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.400]   go to a good college or you're hoping that you'll land a good job or you're hoping that
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.340]   you'll get married to a good, nice Christian individual or you're hoping you'll have a
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.380]   nice family, hoping you can raise a good family at a good church and hoping X, Y, and Z.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.020]   Every single one of those moments is going to be a test of your hope.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.700]   What are you placing?
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.700]   Where have you placed your hope?
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.500]   So I'm coming at this forefront of the idea that the holy woman that Apostle Peter is
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:21.020]   thinking about weren't just simply women who took a beating and then they survived.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.620]   Right?
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.860]   We're talking about women who had an incredible amount of hope in the God they trusted that
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.340]   caused their ability and gave them power to continue to endure.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.420]   Okay?
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:42.220]   In thinking about that then, in terms of the hope that they had in God, this is the
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.100]   source of their ability to submit.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.940]   And it says with that ability, they adorned themselves with submission.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.620]   I want to move on to a second question.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:58.220]   If you guys can, I have a little table for you there asking the question, you know, how
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.020]   should wives be submissive?
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.300]   On a grand scale of things, we might have a very, I don't know, subconsciously very chauvinistic
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.780]   view of what submission would look like.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.860]   It's like, you know, just be quiet and do what they say versus, you know, something
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.660]   that's good in terms of what submission would look like.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.820]   So as a table, as a group, please fill in that table.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.820]   What would be some markers or principles of good submission that a wife could show versus
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.740]   bad submission?
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   Bad submission.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.740]   Okay?
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.740]   Go.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.380]   So at this time, you guys should at least have a couple in each box.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.860]   Let's share a few.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.860]   Let's just share a few.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.420]   If I could have a raise of hand of someone who wants to just share what they put on the
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.500]   good side.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   Just raise of hand.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   Yes.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   Okay.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:58.340]   So bearing with your husband even if he's wrong.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.860]   Having that patience to, you know, even when he's wrong or whatnot, to bear with him.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.860]   What else?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   If, huh?
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.860]   There you go.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.860]   Next.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.860]   What's another one?
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.220]   How about, let's see, that was a guy's table.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:28.860]   So far table on the right, on the good side of submission.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.860]   Joyfully.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.860]   Good.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.220]   In terms of the attitude of the heart.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.220]   Okay?
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:43.020]   And one more for the good side of the submission.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.060]   Okay.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.060]   Good.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.900]   So honoring and respecting the one that you are submitting to.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.940]   What about on the bad side of submission?
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.980]   I'll just call on a few.
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:16.660]   How about directly ahead of me with Anson, Jeremy, Paul?
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.660]   Just following without considering if that's sin or not.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.780]   From the woman's side, she's got to be thinking, right?
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.540]   Whether this is the will of God or whether it's contrary and actual sin.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   What else?
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   Yes?
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.540]   Okay.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:38.180]   Submitting with a level of arrogance and pride, because you can do that.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   What else?
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.380]   Let's see.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:51.580]   Group to my left here with Rachel, Janine.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.060]   Okay.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.100]   Being resentful while you're submitting.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:04.660]   So as we kind of described these two categories of what submission is, part of the reason
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:12.740]   why I had you guys do this is because I think submission is, one, the passage or the book
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.500]   that we're studying makes it a big topic.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.180]   A topic where you're applying this in various scenarios in various ways.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.900]   But what's more, it's actually a large topic conceptually for us too.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.100]   Even when it's specific to the home.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.620]   So the Ephesians passage, when it talks about subjection and submission, I'm just going
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.620]   to read it to you.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.540]   It says, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, for the husband is
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.540]   the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, he himself being the savior
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.700]   of the body.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:49.540]   But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.020]   in everything."
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.500]   And if you just take that and say, "Okay, that's it."
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.380]   There is danger of you misapplying.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.620]   There's a danger of you going outside of the bounds of scripture, so to speak.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.460]   Because there are ways in which what submission shouldn't be.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.380]   I absolutely agree with all the various things that you guys said in terms of what submission
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.040]   should not be.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.780]   Submission should not be, I turn off my brain and whatever this man says, that's what's
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.380]   going to go.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:26.140]   Rather, the way that even the passage that we're looking at, there is an intentional,
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.700]   there is an attitude that makes submission what it is.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.780]   What's more, this kind of submission where if you are to just submit in every single
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:42.060]   way that you're avoiding to change your husband in any single way and there's nothing you're
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.820]   trying to exhort the husband to do, rather he's commanding you.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.580]   Because that's not necessarily submission either.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.100]   So sometimes when I hear these, I go to some weddings and they have these wedding vows
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.380]   like, "I'll never make you stop playing video games.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.900]   I'll always let you do this."
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.900]   And that I'm just like, "That's not submission either."
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.900]   You know?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.860]   That's not submission either.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.860]   Why?
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.900]   Because the passage itself says you're trying to win your husband.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.500]   You're trying to win your husband.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:15.900]   What's more, having a kind of dependency on your husband where in every single aspect
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.740]   of your life, both physically and spiritually, where you're so tied to your husband that
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.300]   he is your hope, that's a wrong kind of submission.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.500]   We just talked about how even when the wife is in the relationship with her husband, that
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.460]   kind of relationship has to be one which her hope is in God.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.140]   Her hope is in God.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.900]   So as we think about that a little bit, we're going to describe in greater detail through
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.980]   going through this passage what submission rightly is.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.100]   Think about this.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.260]   In that example of what holy women did, it started off with saying they hoped in God
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.980]   that they were being submissive and then later it says, "Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.380]   him Lord and you have become her children, if you," what?
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.540]   "Do what is right."
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.580]   Do what is right.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.720]   So I have a cross-reference for you there.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.860]   Please turn your Bibles over to 2 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 11.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.860]   Okay?
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:24.540]   2 Corinthians chapter 7 verse 11.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.740]   It says, starting from verse 11 down to verse 12, it says, "For behold what earnestness
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.300]   in this very thing, this godly sorrow has produced in you, what vindication of yourselves,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.780]   what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging of wrong.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.260]   In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.100]   So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.780]   of the one offended, but that your earnestness on our behalf might be made known to you in
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.220]   the sight of God."
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.620]   Okay?
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:04.700]   So there is a sense in which when we think about good submission, that good submission
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:11.460]   has the idea of both being innocent and doing what is right in the sight of God in every
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.980]   instance.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.420]   In good submission, there is a constant intentionality and thinking of what's good in this moment.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.180]   What's good for my husband who is not a believer?
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.860]   What's good for our family, you know, who we will, even if we find ourselves in desperate
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.820]   and hard circumstances.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.940]   So rather than actually think of submission at an attitude of, "Fine, have it your way."
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.940]   Right?
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.940]   Fine, right?
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:42.220]   No, the person who is submitting is actually constantly thinking intentionally what is
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:49.100]   good, godly, kind, peaceful, lovely in the sight of God in this circumstance.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.180]   So there's a sense in which the one who is submitting in this scenario to a husband who
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.580]   is not a believer is thinking even harder than the husband.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.660]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.940]   Is thinking even far above and beyond what the husband might be thinking.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.460]   That they are desiring to have a clarity of conscience before the Lord, doing what is
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   right and peaceable in his sight.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.140]   What's more, good submission is without fear.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.500]   Right?
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.940]   He says, or the passage says that we are, or the ladies are children of Sarah if they
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.780]   do right without being frightened by fear.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.660]   Think about that for a moment on how that connects.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   Right?
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.020]   How that connects.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.740]   There I said is a bad form of submission.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.460]   You know what that is?
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:43.140]   A bad form of submission is when you're so frightened of the consequences that your motivation
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.180]   to do what they say is you're just scared.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.180]   Right?
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.740]   That you're just scared of what's going to happen, you're just scared of etc, etc.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.660]   That's not the proper motivation for submission.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.620]   So that kind of submission will always bear its fruit.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.100]   You know?
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.420]   Especially even with us and any relationship that we have, especially with us and our relationship
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   with God, that kind of submission and obedience is going to bear its own fruit.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.980]   But just like we said earlier, the hope that we have in God is going to remove that fear,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.660]   is going to tend to that fear and cause us to have an ability to submit with a proper
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.660]   attitude.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.540]   And we're going to talk about that more as we move forward.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.540]   Okay?
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.540]   So, so far we've described the submission that ladies are supposed to have in these
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.180]   ways.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:43.420]   But and um, I'm just going to skip number six where it says, "Abraham and Sarah, why
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.860]   do you think he refers to this couple?"
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:51.860]   By just kind of brief, just for the sake of time, you know, he's making this case that
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.980]   this design of the structure was not something that he just made up.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:02.740]   That this design was a calling of God, especially because his readers have an element of the
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   Jewishness to them.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.860]   If you notice, there's a lot of Jewish terminology, lots of quotation of the Old Testament.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.020]   And as they see Abraham and Sarah as the father, you know, father Abraham of their, of their
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.700]   nation, um, he said, he's pointing to that saying, this is the calling of God and the
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.860]   pattern of God that he set long before.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.860]   Okay?
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.340]   But what we're going to do is change gear a little bit and go to verse three and verse
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.340]   four.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.340]   Okay?
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.340]   So let's read this here.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.780]   He says, "Your adornment must not be merely external, braiding the hair, wearing gold
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:40.060]   jewelry or putting on dresses, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:46.500]   imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   God."
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.500]   Okay?
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:56.180]   So earlier, the way that I put it was, here is the example of what you want to be, right?
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:01.700]   And then here in verse three and four is describing in greater detail the content of that example
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.900]   and the means by which you're going to accomplish what God has designed for you.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.940]   Right?
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:13.980]   He talks about first what not to do, just simply trying to win the heart of people by
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.220]   externals, simply trying to change what's on the outside, simply trying to improve whatever
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.420]   is on the external side.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.540]   But he says to work on the internal, the quality of being gentle and quiet in spirit.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.540]   Right?
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.140]   Now I want to ask you, for those of you guys who did your homework, if you guys noticed,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:39.740]   I said, go to a website that has Bible helps of looking up Greek words, and there's a resource
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.420]   of what's called Strong's Number.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:46.500]   I'm not sure if you guys were able to do that, but did you guys get a chance to look at that?
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.220]   If someone did, can you kind of yell out what you found as a definition or a gloss of that
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.220]   word?
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.220]   Yes?
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.220]   Okay, no?
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.860]   Yes?
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.860]   Humble and meek.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:16.620]   So this idea of gentleness, yeah, in the way that it's used in scripture, it has got very
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.620]   elaborate kind of use.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.700]   When you think about this idea of being gentle, right?
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.340]   I mean, there's a sense that sometimes the way we can use it, but when you go to that
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.980]   website and you look at the resource, here's one of the definitions that it has as like
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.860]   a longer how it's used in the Bible.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.860]   Right?
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.180]   I'm just going to read it to you.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:40.800]   He says, "This idea of gentleness has an idea of meekness toward God in the disposition
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.980]   of the spirit where we accept his dealings with us as good, and therefore, without disputing
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.500]   or resisting what's happening.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.780]   In the Old Testament, the meek are those wholly relying on God rather than their own strengths
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.180]   to defend against injustice.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.780]   Thus, meekness towards evil people means knowing God is permitting the injuries they inflict,
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:05.860]   that he is using them to purify his elect, and that he will deliver his elect in time.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.940]   Gentleness and meekness as opposite of being self-assertive and self-interested, it stems
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.940]   from this trust and hope in God's goodness and control over the situation."
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.980]   Right?
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.540]   So just as a means of like Bible study for you guys, that blueletter.com, for just anybody
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.820]   who doesn't necessarily know the Greek can just click onto it to get a bigger sense of
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.500]   how is this word used generally in the scripture.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:36.060]   It definitely, it generally gives like a nice description of what that word would mean.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.500]   But I think as a combination of the two, just think about this individual, where their submission
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:50.660]   is not, you know, again, just simply yielding and saying, "Fine, I'll do what you say."
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   Right?
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.300]   Rather, it is a peace that one has.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.620]   It is an attitude of the heart where they express to the unbelieving spouse, or whether
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.980]   in the cases of our submission to believing spouses, even whatever it may be, that there
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.340]   is an attitude of hope and faith where we can have peace.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.340]   Why?
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   Because we trust in God.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   Right?
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.340]   The kind of submission that he's asking for here, yes, involves yielding to the leadership
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:22.980]   of the husband, but realize that it involves this aspect of a character, the quality, and
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.860]   the attitude of the heart as well.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.340]   Okay?
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.260]   This he says is precious in the sight of God.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.260]   Why?
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:38.420]   Because our ability to not retaliate, our ability to not get revenge, our ability to
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.780]   not just, you know, combat them, compete with them, and try to, you know, to basically dominate
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.900]   them, what that shows is our faith.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.860]   What that shows is our hope.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.300]   What I mentioned earlier.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   Okay?
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.020]   All right.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:01.260]   So, in thinking about this then, going back to verse one, going back to verse one, and
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.380]   verse two, it says, "In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.980]   so that, even if any one of them are obedient to the word, disobedient to the word, they
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.780]   may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.020]   and respectful behavior."
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   The challenge is that even in the home, even in an environment where, you know, naturally
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.380]   there's supposed to be a, you know, kind of comfort level, naturally you're supposed to
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.340]   let your guard down and all that kind of stuff, there is an expectation that we have winsome
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.340]   behavior.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.340]   Right?
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.900]   That there is a purposeful intentionality where we're saying that in all we're doing,
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.740]   in our both submissiveness, in what we're doing in terms of just, you know, respecting
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.300]   them, in what we're doing with our, you know, our own purity, whatever it may be, we're
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.540]   trying to win them over.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   Right?
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:59.060]   So, for those of you guys who, you know, might be thinking, "Yeah, this specific passage
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.700]   doesn't directly apply to you because you're not a spouse of an unbeliever in the home."
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   But this same attitude should be exhibited by every single one of us.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.700]   Right?
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.460]   Whether we're dealing with difficult people, whether we're dealing with various circumstances
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.140]   outside of the house, this is the attitude we should have.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.980]   That by our behavior and our attitude, they're being won over.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:29.140]   I mean, for you personally, you know, personally, there is this question.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:36.940]   When we experience injustice, our normal thoughts are not, "Win this individual over."
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.620]   But can we get there?
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.180]   Can we get there where we're not thinking, "This individual needs to recognize their
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.180]   injustice."
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.180]   You know?
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.420]   "This individual needs to pay me back.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.580]   This individual better get it right."
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.700]   But rather, you're thinking on the level of, you know, winning that individual over
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.900]   to the grace of God.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.500]   Okay?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.660]   Alright.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:07.540]   Any questions, thoughts about verses 1 through 7?
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.660]   I just want to summarize that section by saying this.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:19.020]   Earlier I mentioned that the challenge in this passage, especially given the context
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.860]   they find themselves in, it is a kind of worldview-changing concept.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.500]   Now, for many of you, you guys have heard this before in terms of roles of women to
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.860]   submit to their husbands.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   Yes.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.300]   Now, that's something common to all of us who, let's say, are Bible-teaching churches
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.340]   or especially at our church too.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:42.780]   But, if you were to place yourself in their shoes and just think, right?
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:49.140]   Just think that these ladies who, he's talking to people who for their faith have already
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.820]   been oppressed.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.740]   He's talking to people where there is systematic suffering for the people who call themselves
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.740]   Christian.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.860]   And I would imagine then that the husband, should he be a disobedient man, should he
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.860]   be a pagan who buys into the philosophy of the world, might be thinking, "Look, now
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:13.540]   he has reason and rationale because of what's going on in the government to even be harsher
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.540]   on his wife."
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:21.700]   And in that moment, what's natural for most people is either flee, run, get out of there.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   Right?
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.700]   But the scripture, rather than contrary to what is our natural reaction, says, "Even
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.460]   in those moments, let your attitude shine.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.820]   Let your hope and faith shine even in one of those dire moments."
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.820]   Okay?
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.820]   All right.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:45.220]   Then, I'm going to wrap up with exhortation to husbands.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   Okay?
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.140]   And I know today, I think it's Husband's Day, right?
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.680]   So I mean, not Husband's Day, but Father, Dads, there's people who are alternating.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.720]   So you guys can make sure you really pay attention here.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.080]   Let's take a look on verse 7.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.520]   It says, "You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:14.120]   with someone weaker, since she is a woman, and show her honor as a fellow heir of the
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.720]   grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered."
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   Okay?
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:23.840]   Now, I want to ask you this question, and please take a moment to think about this.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.480]   Notice something from the beginning of the passage, that there is a continuity and connection
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.040]   of thought.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.160]   Just as there was at the beginning of verse 1, "In the same way, you wives submit."
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   Right?
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:42.440]   And we saw a trail of thinking, a trail of rationale, which for us, we can easily connect.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.360]   Yeah, just like he said, "Submit to the government," there should be submission in the home.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.340]   But look at this.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.540]   With all the commands that are given here, how is this in the same pattern?
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.500]   How is this in the same way?
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.900]   Aren't husbands supposed to not submit and lead?
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.620]   Aren't husbands supposed to set the tone?
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.380]   Aren't husbands supposed to direct the wives?
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.060]   Aren't husbands supposed to command and be that figure of strength or whatnot?
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.420]   So how is this in the same way?
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.500]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:27.100]   Think about it, think about it.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.420]   Okay.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.320]   Anybody have a shot at that?
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.140]   How is this for the command for the husband the same way as it is what we just read for
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   the wives?
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.140]   To have an attitude and heart as one who hopes in God.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.260]   Okay, to have an attitude and heart as one who hopes in God.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.260]   Excellent.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.260]   What else?
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.260]   Yes?
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   It's a chain of authority leading all the way back to God.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.260]   So the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   They have to submit to the authority surrounding them.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   They have to submit to God as well.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.260]   They have to submit to God as well.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.260]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:24.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.940]   And the men don't have anything easier or better per se.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.680]   hierarchy right? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. But nonetheless we are all still under the
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:44.340]   authority of God. Together. Okay? But what's more, even in the concept of how we view,
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.920]   how we view leadership, how we view the call of man, there's a sense in which both what
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:58.380]   we do and both what women do are both dying to ourselves. Right? There's a sense in which
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.820]   what we're called to do, a lot of times maybe we're thinking because we lead, because we
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:08.860]   etc, etc, maybe that translates to us then, so now I'm in charge and I get to benefit
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.580]   from their submission. But that's not the way God put it. The way that God put it is,
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:19.540]   even for just as the wife is called to submit and therefore die to herself and make herself
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.440]   vulnerable, there's a sense with the man as he leads, he dies to himself and he takes
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.340]   responsibility for that vulnerable person. And so I want to make a call to all the guys
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:36.220]   in here. If you think about leadership, we're going to have lots of different styles of
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.940]   leadership. Some of us are going to be like real vocal, some of us are going to come off
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.260]   real strong, etc, etc. But nonetheless, the summary of our leadership is going to be we
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.660]   now have a huge burden and responsibility for the well-being of the individual. What
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.940]   did I say about submission? Your submission is not just simply fine, you just tell me
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.740]   what to do and I'll do it, because that's not real submission. You have to be constantly
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:06.160]   thinking what is in the best in the sight of God. So likewise, husbands, thinking to
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.900]   and asking what is spiritually, physically best for the people that I'm leading, it's
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:17.300]   in the same thing, same category. We're trying to achieve and accomplish the same goal, yet
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:23.260]   we have now different roles. And so I want to talk about that because I really do feel
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:30.740]   like there is still a continuity behind what Apostle Peter is calling the wives to do and
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:36.140]   what Apostle Peter is calling the husbands to do. And because for both concepts of submission
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.740]   and leadership, this world has tainted it, we kind of find that it's just always like
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:47.380]   this. We always find that it's always like at odds with each other in some way or another.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.780]   But that's typically because whatever gift we've been given by God, we learn to exploit.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:59.140]   So I want to start off with this idea that there is this continuity of idea and then
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:05.460]   this passage challenges husbands to live with their wives in an understanding way. Let me
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:11.100]   ask you another question. What are men supposed to understand? Now what's really interesting
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.780]   as a kind of a setup for you guys while you think about that, is the NIV kind of says
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:24.900]   like be considerate. And I'm going to be honest with you, many people have interpreted this
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.980]   passage and I'll confess, six years ago, it's already been a long time, six years ago I
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:36.700]   gave a sermon on being a man. And then I actually referenced this passage. And the way I interpreted
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:45.100]   it was you have to be understanding because you know, woman logic. It's pretty bad, I'm
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.580]   just confessing. The way I kind of made it sound was, yeah, there's a sense in which
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.620]   men just have to be patient. You understand the struggles of women. You know how sometimes
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.900]   insecure they are, you know, sometimes, et cetera, et cetera, they struggle with their
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.260]   emotions and I'm just digging myself a hole. And then you just, men just have to understand
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.940]   that, you know, have you guys seen those memes? Woman logic. And then it's just like, is that
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.700]   what the Bible is saying? Live with women in an understanding way, which means you're
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.260]   just supposed to be patient, you're just supposed to understand that they're, you know, they're
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:23.060]   X, Y, and Z. Is that all it's saying? Like, what are you supposed to understand? Again,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.780]   there are a lot of people who interpret this passage by way of saying, understanding just
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:33.540]   means just consider, be considerate of them, be patient with them. Is that all he's saying?
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:39.460]   Okay. For the sake of time, I'm going to let you think about that for a little bit and
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:46.180]   then I make this case. No way. Right? Otherwise it would seem kind of not fair. Right? To
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.860]   the woman, like we just went six verses of like, you need to submit, you need to have
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.180]   character in the heart, you need to do this. And it's like, guys, just be patient with
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.780]   them. Okay? Like, is that, is that all he's saying? And absolutely not. I don't think
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:04.700]   so. I think when he's saying this, the, you have to, you have to take into consideration
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:10.260]   how it actually comes off. In the Greek, the way it reads is husbands, likewise dwelling
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:15.900]   together with knowledge. Okay? So it doesn't just say be patient with these women. In the
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:22.780]   Greek, the way it reads is husbands dwell together with knowledge. Okay? So by way of
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:30.140]   application, you're supposed to live and be with her with full knowledge. But I asked
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:37.660]   the question of what if you think the answer to that is just the way she thinks that would
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:43.620]   be too small. Why? Because the huge chunk, remember earlier I said that the application,
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   the application of all that we know of the gospel comes in first Peter chapter one, verse
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.820]   13. We'll take a look at it. Okay? So let's go back in your Bible. It's chapter one, verse
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.340]   12, 13 and 14. And this is what it says. It was revealed to them that they were not serving
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.940]   themselves, but you and these things which are now have been announced to you through
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.900]   those who preach the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit sent from
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:14.060]   heaven things into which angels long to look. Therefore, what prepare your minds for action,
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.980]   keep sober in spirit and fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.420]   of Jesus Christ as obedient children do not be conformed to the former lusts, which were
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:31.980]   yours in what in your ignorance. So when the apostle says you need to live in knowledge,
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:38.300]   he's not just talking about, Oh, you just need to be patient with these women. No, he's
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.460]   saying all that is pertaining to a higher knowledge of your worldview in Christ, of
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:49.540]   your worldly through the spirit that all applies. So namely he says, stop giving into your pagan
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:55.060]   lust. Stop being so selfish like you were before, where all you thought about is gratifying
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:01.060]   your flesh, exploiting this woman who's called to serve, called to submit and then saying,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:09.380]   serve me, give me what I want. Right? So your worldview of what marriage commitment should
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.100]   look like your worldview of your role as a husband, your worldview of her role, your
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:22.740]   worldview of family contentment and wellbeing, all this stuff matters. And then as a subset,
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:28.140]   there's an understanding of who she is. That would only be a small part of the greater
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:33.780]   knowledge he wants us to live by. So that's why I'm not sure if many of you guys have
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.180]   read this book. For those of you guys who are single, I recommend you read it. For those
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.740]   of you guys are married, I recommend you read it. There's a guy named Stuart Scott who wrote
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.780]   a book called exemplary husband, first three chapters, theology. He says, this is what
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.660]   a leader should know. Why? Because if you have no idea what you should do, you're not
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:57.740]   a leader. Makes sense. You should be leading with full knowledge. Well, of a worldview,
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:05.340]   you should be a, in many ways, a theologian of what God is expecting from us. Okay? So
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:11.460]   in thinking about that a little bit, when it says for us to dwell with, with her in
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:17.860]   knowledge, it is challenging us, especially as men to apply the gospel in how we are dwelling
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.780]   and living with her. What's more moving forward. It says living with her in an understanding
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:34.100]   way as with someone weaker since she is a woman. Okay. And, uh, Oh wait, I think I kind
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:41.900]   of messed up the order here. Sorry. Um, we're going to kind of go out of order a little
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:48.380]   bit in terms of, um, that section where it says weaker, we'll come back to that. And
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:54.580]   then it says this command, show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life. Okay.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:03.380]   Putting the two commands together. One live with knowledge to show her honor. Now in showing
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:09.020]   an individual honor as what men should be doing, I think there's a difference between
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:15.060]   just showing somebody respect as opposed to showing someone honor. Right? I think there's
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.740]   a difference between just appreciating somebody versus showing someone honor. And I want us
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.100]   to think about that for a little bit. You know, what would this idea of honoring look
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:31.020]   like? Because truthfully speaking, we respect a lot of things, you know, for those of you
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.380]   guys play basketball, you respect referees, you know, but you don't run over and be like,
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:42.860]   well, bam flower, you know, you did such a good job. You respect, you know, the laws
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:47.340]   of the land, but you don't stop at every speed light to just be like, bow. I honor you. You
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.460]   know, we, there's a difference between just simply respecting and acknowledging something
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:57.140]   that's there versus honoring. And you know, what's really crazy about this is the word
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:04.420]   for honor to show her honor is actually the same word translated precious in chapter two,
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:10.140]   verse seven. So earlier in chapter two, verse seven, he talked about this precious stone,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:15.860]   this precious stone to which to us is a huge advantage. And that word for precious is the
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:24.540]   same word that he uses to honor. So if there is anything fragile we've ever owned, if there's
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.020]   anything valuable, like a family heirloom, if there's something that we've moved, carried
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:34.420]   up, carries an incredible amount of value, that's the way that we should treat the woman
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:39.300]   that treat the wives. For those of you guys who are married, there is this question. And
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.620]   I was really personally convicted by this. And as I was kind of thinking, and truthfully
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.420]   speaking in the last, I don't know, I feel like dating back from last July, life has
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:56.700]   been kind of crazy. There's just been so much going on. And in the last like month or two,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:02.940]   I've personally been sick and all this kind of happens. And then there's a sense to which,
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:09.980]   yeah, like I communicate my love to my wife. But I have to follow up a second question
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:16.940]   to that, which is, does she understand what I'm communicating? What I mean by that is
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.540]   sometimes as a man, you communicate your love, but then you think you're done because you
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:30.060]   just communicated whatever you needed to say. But then in this, when he talks about honoring
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.540]   your wife, there's a sense to which is calling us to go above and beyond whatever we think
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:42.060]   is just simply acceptable, to the degree where we can ask ourselves, does she understand
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:48.100]   and get that on a human level, she is the most important, precious, valuable thing that
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:56.940]   I have? That she has the honor and the affection of my heart. And the reason why I kind of
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:02.220]   gave you my own personal kind of life example is because again, I think sometimes if let's
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:08.780]   say I schedule in, "Hey, I'm busy. So on Tuesday, we're going to go out. Okay." I mean, you
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.820]   guys know that's just not enough. What if I ever just said like, "Hey, we had Tuesday,
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:22.220]   you know, a Tuesday date night, so I'm done." That don't make any sense. We need to be constantly
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:30.900]   pursuing, honoring, and showing as precious who they are in our lives. So I make a challenge
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.900]   that this passage, this call to the man, again, it's not just simply like, "Okay, guys, you
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:41.220]   know, you know how women are and just be understanding, whatever." But there is this even higher calling
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:47.580]   that in the heart condition, you're seeing her as something precious. And if she is then,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.620]   then all the various applications of what we said, seeking her best interest, taking
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.500]   responsibility for the wellbeing. This is the kind of attitude that men should have.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:03.660]   And for those of you who aren't married yet, think about that. If you're an individual
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:09.140]   who doesn't know how to respect first and foremost, and then to honor somebody, we need
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:16.420]   to learn how to do that. Right? If you're a guy who's regularly given not to uplift,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.940]   like exhort and really affirm people, but rather you're always just making fun of people,
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.660]   crashing them down and breaking them, because you think that's what, you know, cool guys
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:31.780]   or whatever it may be do, we got to realize that's not showing what men need to be doing
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:38.820]   and learn to do for the future. Okay. And what's more, I want to kind of wrap up with
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:46.460]   this next two points right here. The passage talks about how, in terms of why we need to
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.580]   be understanding, in terms of why we need to make sure that we're, you know, being careful
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:57.140]   and see somebody as precious, is that this individual is someone weaker since she is
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:04.260]   a woman. Right? I want to ask you this question. In what way is she weaker? Does this refer
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:10.220]   to only physical weakness? And again, as I studied this passage, I kind of realized like,
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.780]   maybe the common way that people looked at this, like, yeah, you know, she can't carry
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.020]   as much. She can't carry as many bags in the, in the whatever. She can't carry the heavy
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:23.020]   trash. I don't know. Maybe that's how some people might've thought. That's just physically
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:30.060]   this individual happens to be weaker than men. But is that, is that what it's really
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:38.180]   just talking about? Maybe just a physical weakness that one has? I would like to say
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:46.140]   again, no, that is not necessarily what it's talking about. I want to kind of highlight
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:52.320]   this thing. And I got this from the Baker commentary by Jobes. The author highlighted
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:59.020]   the fact that the passage has a comparative word, weaker, not like this person is weak.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:06.380]   Okay. In comparison, there is a weakness, but what is this weakness? And this is the
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.780]   case that I want to make. And it was important enough. I know we've kind of gone long already,
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:15.020]   almost a full hour, but I just want to kind of put this in here. Okay. That what we need
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.980]   to realize is there is a two kinds of strengths that people need to make sure that the husband
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.220]   and wife role operate correctly. What do I mean by this two strengths? A man needs to
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.860]   have a kind of strength where he's leading and he's not stumbled by fear because he's
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.140]   so afraid he's going to mess up in his leading or he's going to mess up in X, Y, and Z. He's
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   not going to do a good job and his pride is going to get hurt. And he needs to have strength
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:47.300]   to overcome that. Men have a lot of fear when it comes to performance anxiety. Like I need
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.740]   to do this, this, this, this. And if it doesn't go well and I fail, then, uh, and they have
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.340]   a big fear about that. But in terms of for the ladies, there is a strength that they
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:04.340]   need where the role that God has called them to is one of vulnerability, right? In many
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.700]   ways, women are placed into a role where they make themselves vulnerable because they're
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:14.220]   making their, they've been asked to follow. They've been asked to submit by the call of
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:20.580]   God, right? And this is where the passage is teaching men, you need to understand she's
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.580]   not just physically weak. God has placed you in a role of vulnerability. Do not exploit
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:32.700]   that. We're so in tune or that's typically like what we do with anything good and opportunity
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:38.500]   we have. We exploit the opportunities we have to be selfish. So we exploit the opportunity
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.820]   in our, in our liberty, liberty and Christian freedom and exploit that for selfishness,
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.580]   grace and mercy, which we receive free. We exploit that for selfishness. But this passage
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:56.620]   is saying, think otherwise. God has called the lady to a position that is more vulnerable
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:02.500]   than you live with them with knowledge and understanding, see them as precious and honor
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:10.180]   them. Right? So as I think about that, I don't think it's just, just a, um, a call for men
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:15.900]   to understand, Oh, she's weaker physically. So make sure you carry the heavy stuff, right?
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:23.300]   It's far more than that. It's far more than that. Now I want to conclude by saying, so
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:28.380]   in all of this, a big challenge for us to think through the roles that God has given
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:35.620]   us and how our hope in God is challenging us to fulfill these roles. But what's more,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:42.180]   he says at the very tail end of the exhortation to the husband, he says at the very end that,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.620]   you know, we need to show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:54.420]   may not be hindered. So the rationale for all this, why husbands need to do this, be
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:59.140]   understanding, why wives need to submit, the rationale for all that is not so that you
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.340]   would have a fine and dandy, peaceful home, right? The rationale for all that is not so
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:11.220]   that you will have a, you know, a marriage life to envy where everybody's looking at
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:16.940]   you like, wow, you know, the rationale behind that is your conscience before God. So you
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.660]   can pray to him and you will notice that when you read the passage before and you read the
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.260]   passes after that in terms of why we are doing what we're doing, taking on the call that
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:31.940]   God has given us just so that one, we're seeking his good pleasure and two, that our consciousness
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:38.060]   be clear before God, that there is an innocence between us and God and that when we can, when
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:45.300]   we are in our relationship with the Lord, that there is a clarity, right? So everything
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:52.020]   here is motivated by our relationship with our father, that before him, we have clarity
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:57.700]   of conscience, okay? All right. I know that was kind of a long study. There's like much
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:08.660]   to be said through that. Is there any questions or thoughts on that passage? Okay, well, let's
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:25.260]   take some time to pray. Let's pray. Heavenly father, we want to pray and ask Lord that
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:31.660]   when we hear the challenge of the scripture for us to do things that typically are not
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:38.660]   natural to our flesh, when we're called to do things that really are at the standard
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:44.380]   of God and Lord, maybe standards that we've accepted before are blown away and we realize
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:49.140]   father God that what you expect is so much greater. I pray Lord that you grant to us
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:54.820]   first just a commitment that with all effort, with all our hearts, we will try to follow
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:51:01.380]   your way. And I ask God that you would continue to grant to us great faith so that we would
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:10.060]   have the power to do so. Lord, I ask that as the family is truly so important and as
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:15.380]   the relationship between husband and wife, who we are as men and women is so important
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:21.700]   father God, I ask Lord that especially at our church, Lord, you would challenge us to
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:27.900]   really fulfill what you have designed. We know father God that we're going to experience
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:32.380]   conflict with the philosophy of the world. We know father God that oftentimes we're going
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:39.060]   to experience just big hurdles because of the worldview in which we live, the surrounding
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:44.220]   that we have. But again, I ask Lord that you grant to us just a heart of perseverance and
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.940]   endurance Lord. Father, we thank you again in Christ name we pray. Amen.
