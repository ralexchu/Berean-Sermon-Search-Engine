[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Let's gather into our tables take our seats and we'll pray to get ready for tonight's Bible study
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   All right, please join with me in a word of prayer
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:22.360]   Heavenly Father we are so grateful to you God. We're so grateful that you make our gathering possible
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.980]   you're the one and the reason why we join together and
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.900]   Lord God by the word that you provide the spirit you provide and the gospel you've provided
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.320]   We are able to have fellowship in this way
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.040]   we recognize God what a privilege it is to be able to have a
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   United body and we again want to thank you for making it all possible according to your grace
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.080]   It is also our prayer that as we join together
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.880]   It's that as you're the one making it possible Lord that it is pleasing in your sight
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   I ask God then that you would continue just to sanctify each and every single one of us
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.080]   cause our
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.320]   Theology our faith to be so full with the content of Christ cause our spirit to be so eager to worship
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.720]   To give you praise to learn of your word and grow
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.040]   that God the content of our faith and the attitude of our hearts would be
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.440]   Truly the sacrifice you desire to see and now Lord as we join in with our voices. We do pray
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.400]   God that again you'd be honored and that we would be blessed throughout this Bible study. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   [Silence]

[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   When my darkest doubts befall
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Trust Him when to simply trust Him
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   Seems the hardest thing of all
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   [Music]
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   I will trust my Savior Jesus

[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   Is the safest place of all
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   Jesus, only Jesus

[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   He has said His way is best
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   And I know the path He's chosen
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Leads to everlasting rest
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Jesus, only Jesus

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   [Music]
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Pour on that cross
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   Pour on that cross
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   How it was seen
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   I can go now ever trusting
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   In the one who died for me
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   What can I bring
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   For your gift is complete

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Lord with every part of me
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Pour on that cross
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   How it was seen

[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   The splendor of the King
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   Clothed in majesty
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Let all the earth rejoice
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   All the earth rejoice
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   He wraps himself in light
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   Darkness tries to hide
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Trembles at his voice

[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Let's pray.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   Dear Lord, we just come before you this evening.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   It's privileged that we're able to just meet freely
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   and to enter into your presence.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   We thank you for the sacrifice of your son.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   We thank you Lord for just all the blessings that you give us
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   and all the things that we just don't deserve,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   that you still continue to love us,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   that you can still continue to just pursue us.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   And yeah, we just thank you for bringing us here tonight.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   I pray Lord, as we just go into a time of discussion,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   that you just give us strength, give us energy tonight,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   allow us to be focused and attentive
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   and allow us to have fruitful conversations.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   In your name we pray, Amen.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   Okay, well I'd like to go over some announcements for you guys
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   so you guys know what's coming up.

[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   to future VBS, etc., or even just to babysit,
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   we do require a safety training that's going to take place
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   on 10/20 at 1.30 p.m. in the main sanctuary.

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   so that we can know how many people to expect
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   and put that on your calendar.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   For all the men, there is a men's ministry fellowship
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   taking place on Saturday, November 9th.

[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   a panel of some of the faithful men of our church

[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   so that we can get together, have potluck or dinner.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   And then we'll also have a service that will be broadcast from the church
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   so that we can be on the same page with the worship and message that evening.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Okay? Great.

[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   (general chatter)
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.400]   All right, so, sometimes you may just simply
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.400]   just don't want to be in a crowd,
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   or maybe there's some people you don't get along with,
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   or just in your priority, just making friends
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   is just not that important, right?
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   Some of you guys may know, the earlier part of the church,
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   we had another elder at our church.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.400]   He passed away a couple years ago.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   But that elder, he was one of those people.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400]   He was an elder, well, it was before he became an elder.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   But he was a faithful member of the church
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   for so many years, and then he kind of woke up
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400]   and started really growing in faith,
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   and every week he would come and ask me for books to read,
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   and he got really deep into theology.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.400]   But one thing that he refused to do
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   is hang out with the church people, right?
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.400]   So he would be prayer, and devoted to scripture,
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   and if we had prayer meeting, he's the first one,
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   the last one to leave, but anytime we went out to eat,
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   he would disappear, right?
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   And then he would actually reappear
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   when we would finish eating, and then we're gathering
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   to do something, right?
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.400]   And so I remember, 'cause he used to really be
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   into triathlete, triathlon, so he would go and run 14 miles
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   and then come back and then join us.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   And I remember sitting down one day with him.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   I said, "How come you don't hang out with us?"
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.400]   And he's like, "I don't want to waste time."
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.400]   Yeah, you don't want to waste time.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.400]   He wants to be productive.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   And I remember sitting, and I told him,
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.400]   and his name was Vince, and I said,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   "Vince, being part of the community is important."
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.400]   I opened up scriptures with him
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   and basically went over this Bible study with him.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   And at the end of it, he said,
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   "Yeah, you know, I just have very little tolerance
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   "for small talk.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.400]   "So if you want to engage and really talk about God,"
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   he said, "but I don't have patience to sit there
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   "and talk about Dodgers and talk about traveling
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   "or Disneyland, you know what I mean?
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   "Stuff like frivolous stuff, right?"
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.400]   So I remember talking to Vince and said,
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   "Vince, most people can't go from zero to 10 feet deep, right?
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   "They're not going to meet somebody new and say,
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400]   "'I want to share my life with you.'
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   "It doesn't happen that way.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]   "Most people are going to have to gradually work up to that.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   "So you're going to have to start with Disneyland,
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   "go to Dodgers, eat some food, hang out.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400]   "They start to feel comfortable with you,
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.400]   "and then you become friends, maybe superficially,
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   "and then you start to go deeper with them.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   "But there are some people I know in this room
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   "feel the same way.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   "You don't have much patience for the in-between part, right?
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   "Some of you are the opposite.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   "You're afraid of going deep,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   "so you want to stay at the shallow end, right?
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400]   "But whatever the case is, right?"
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400]   And I remember challenging him for that,
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   and then literally next week he just stopped running,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   and then he would just hang out with us.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   I remember the first time he would go eat with us,
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   we took four hours to go eat lunch, you know,
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   because our church would just hang out all the time
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   because when the church was smaller,
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   and then we would come back,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   and then you could tell he was so frustrated.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   He said, "I can't believe we took four hours to eat lunch."
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   And I remember telling Vince,
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   "But during those four hours, what did you do?"
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   And he said, "Well, I talked to people."
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   I was like, "Yeah, we didn't waste four hours.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.400]   "The four hours where you are connecting with people,
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   "and then those conversations could turn to talking about God,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.400]   "but you're not going to go from zero to 10, right?"
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   And so without the gathering of the church,
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   that doesn't happen, right?
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   You might meet somebody like you who's like,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.400]   "Yeah, I really want to talk about God in quiet time,"
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   and that's good,
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   but majority of the people usually takes time
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.400]   for them to trust you, for them to open up.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   So if you're in a habit of not gathering and rubbing shoulders
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   and getting to know people and even the shallow things,
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.400]   those things will lead to more connections, right?
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.400]   And that's why we say the gathering of the church is important
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   if we want to build community.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   There's four things that I want to cover about biblical fellowship.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   One is biblical fellowship is always Christ-centered, right?
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   Now, it doesn't mean that every time you get together,
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   you're going to talk about Jesus in quiet time,
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   but it's founded upon your relationship with Christ.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   There is no fellowship with somebody
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   who is not interested in following Christ.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   This is not just like any community, right?
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.400]   Everybody who has all interests, all doctrines,
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.400]   whatever they want to do, I just want to find friends, right?
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.400]   Church is a gathering of people who have been called out
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.400]   for the purpose of honoring and following Christ.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   So the foundation behind true fellowship are other Christians.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   That's why the first covenant in our church
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   is that I confess Jesus Christ as Lord and my Savior, right?
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   And so the fellowship of the church is not just everybody coming in
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   so that we can share life together.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.400]   No, this is sharing Christ together is the foundation of the church.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   Claiming to have union with Christ while living in sin is self-deception.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   And also, wanting to feel connected at church while embracing sin
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   is also self-deception, right?
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.400]   If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   we lie and do not practice the truth.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.400]   No matter how much you say, "I feel connected with Christ
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   and I have fellowship with God," no matter how much you say that,
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   the Bible says, because God is light, if you are embracing sin,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   you don't have fellowship, it doesn't matter how close you feel.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   It doesn't matter how intimate you think, "You know, I'm so intimate.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.400]   Me and God is like that." That's all in your head.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   That's not what the Bible says.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   God is light, and if you are in darkness, there is no fellowship.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   You're deceiving yourself.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.400]   But also, along with that, only those who are communing with Christ
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.400]   is their true fellowship.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.400]   If we walk in light and He Himself in the light,
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400]   we have fellowship with one another.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.400]   Fellowship happens.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   Fellowship is not something that we force upon each other.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   It happens because in the context of other people who are pursuing Christ,
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   when they gather together, fellowship happens.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   Because you're with like-minded people.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   Your mind and heart is headed toward the same place.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   I know Dodgers is playing right now, and some of you guys are barely paying attention
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   because you are fellowshipping in Dodgers, in your heart,
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   even though you're not sitting together talking about Dodgers, watching Dodgers,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   but your hearts are filled with Dodgers.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   So when you are gathered together with other Dodger fans,
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   automatically there's Dodger fellowship going on.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   So in the same way, people who are in love with Christ,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   people who are following Christ, fellowship happens in the context
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   of people who have already have their hearts toward Christ.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400]   You don't have to be talking about Christ to have fellowship.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   You don't have to be having Bible studies to have fellowship.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.400]   If people who are in love with Christ gather together, fellowship tends to happen
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.400]   because we're already--our foundation of our heart is the same.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.400]   Number two, biblical fellowship is other-centered.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Biblical fellowship is other-centered.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   Now, we're going to be looking at 1 Corinthians 10, 20 through 24,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.400]   but I want to read these five things before I move on.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Freedom in Christ--anyone who's a Christian have found freedom in Christ
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   that we are not bound by a code of conduct of this is what you should do,
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400]   this is what you shouldn't do.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   We are freed by the law.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.400]   We're not bound by the Old Testament law.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.400]   Our code of conduct is higher code which puts others' conscience before ours.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   That's what it means to participate and live in a community
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   where I'm not coming in and say, "This bothers me. I like this, and I don't like this,"
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   and you're coming and you will expect everybody else to adjust to me
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.400]   because that's my preference. This is what I want.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   Somebody who is self-centered will never find true community
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.400]   because that person, everywhere they go, wants everybody to adjust to them.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   There is no community with that person no matter where you go.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.400]   Biblical fellowship is other-centered.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.400]   I'm going to read that in the text that we're looking at.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   We are to do all things ultimately for the glory of God.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400]   We are to consider others better than ourselves.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   1 Corinthians 10, 23, 33, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable."
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:22.400]   An immature Christian is always asking, "Is this sinful or is this not sinful?"
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   If it's not sinful, if you can't find a passage in the Bible that says,
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   "I can't do this," then I have the freedom to do whatever I want.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   That is a very fleshly, immature Christian.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   As long as it's not prohibited, unless God said, "You cannot do it,"
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   then that's the standard that they use to what I can and cannot do.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   But he says, "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable."
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   Why is it not profitable? All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   It doesn't encourage other people.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   He said, "Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   Let no one seek his own good.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   Don't make fellowship about, "I like it. I don't like it.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   I don't want to go here because of this."
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   But ultimately, how does it benefit the Church of Christ?
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   How does it benefit the Church?
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   There are some things that we do at church that you might not like.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   I'm sure we do things that you might not like.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.400]   You might not even agree with. Do we have to clean the church every quarter?
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   Do we have to have a Christmas party? Do we have to have a Thanksgiving?
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.400]   Do we have to do this?
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   You can have your own opinion.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.400]   But the things that we're doing at church is for the purpose of edifying the body of Christ.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   So if you use your preference as a standard for everything that,
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   "I like it. I don't like it," but it's like, "Does this edify?"
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   Are there people who will benefit from this?
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   Is the body of Christ built on this?
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   Obviously, the leaders make decisions based upon what we think will edify the body of Christ.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   But if you have a church filled with people who everything that they do and don't do
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   is simply, "I like it. I don't like it,"
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   then it will be impossible to ever make any decisions in the church
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   because we know somebody is going to say something.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   It says, "Does it edify? Let no one seek his own good but that of his neighbor."
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   25-29, "Eat anything that is solid in the meat market without asking questions.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   For conscience' sake, for the earth is the Lord's and all it contains.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go,
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   eat anything that is set before you without asking questions. For the conscience' sake."
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   If anyone says to you, "This meat is sacrificed to idols," do not eat it.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   This is in the context of meat sacrificed to the temple,
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   and some people are saying, "You can't eat that because that's tainted."
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   But Paul is saying, "It's just meat.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   There's no innately irreligious thing because it was at the temple.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   It's cheap. It's delicious. Eat it."
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   You have the freedom to eat it, except if eating that is going to cause someone else
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   to stumble for their conscience' sake, not your conscience' sake,
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   for their conscience' sake, he said, "Don't eat it."
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   If anyone says to you, "This meat is sacrificed to idols,"
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.400]   do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you for conscience' sake.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   I don't mean that not on your own conscience, but the other man's.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   For why is it my freedom judged by another's conscience?
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   If I participate with Thanksgiving, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.400]   In other words, this is not a matter of, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   You have the freedom in that context.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   But for the purpose of the conscience of someone else, don't eat it.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   In other words, don't simply think of yourself. Think of the other person.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   That's why he says, "Whether then you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all for the glory of God."
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   Not simply, "I like it. I don't like it. It bothers me. This is what I prefer,"
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   but for the glory of God.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   "Give no offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the Church of God,
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.400]   just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit,
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved."
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:07.400]   I'm going to go a little bit longer today because I have other things to cover.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400]   What are some things in our generation?
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   Obviously, meat sacrifice to idols is not an issue in our generation.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   But what's an issue in our generation?
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:23.400]   What you wrestle with, that may fall onto this category.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:32.400]   Some of you probably may be wrestling with that right now.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.400]   Say it.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   Drinking is probably top of the list, one of the top of the list.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   How would we apply that to drinking?
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   There are some people in our church who want us to ban drinking.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   "You're not allowed," covenant number 11.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.400]   "Alcohol touches your lips. You cannot be a member."
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   And they have some reasons behind it.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   They grew up in an abused family where the father was an alcoholic,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   or maybe they struggled with it, and they were in a halfway house.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.400]   I know some people who, because they struggled with it,
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.400]   had to go to a rehab center for months.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   I know some people who came to our church,
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   and they said they were around Christians all through high school,
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:33.400]   and they were pretty much drunkards.
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   And he said he had no respect for Christians because of that.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   And so he came to our church, and he said he decided to come to our church
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:43.400]   because he didn't see that in the church.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.400]   And then there are some people in the church who grew up
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   drinking wine with their parents after Bible study.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   So to them it's strange that alcohol is even an issue.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   It depends what your background is.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   So alcohol in and of itself, is it sinful?
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   Yes. Just kidding, just kidding.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   I'm just making sure you're paying attention.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   Of course, alcohol in and of itself is not sinful.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.400]   Jesus turns water into wine.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   Paul says to Timothy, "Drink some wine for the sake of your health."
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   But the way you drink alcohol can be an issue like this,
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   where you say, "I have the freedom."
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   Yes, you have the freedom, but you're very childish.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   Because you're not thinking about anybody else but your freedom.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.400]   I mean, during the pandemic we had issues that came up
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   where people were like, "I have the freedom."
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.400]   Say, "Yes, you have the freedom."
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   But we have church filled with people who feel other way.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   You can say, "But I'm right."
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   It's like, "Yeah, that's what everybody thinks."
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   So there are other issues.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400]   Obviously, drinking is top, and that's the easiest one.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.400]   There's other things that happen.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.400]   But the principle that we are taught is, "Think of others first."
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.400]   It doesn't mean that you can't ever do it,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   but do it with other people in mind.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.400]   Paul says, "If it's going to bother other people, I won't eat meat.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:24.400]   I don't have to eat meat for the sake of other people."
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.400]   That's a mature person.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   A mature person is not somebody who says, "I know Christ.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   I've been free, so I have the freedom to do whatever I want."
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.400]   That's an infant.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   A mature Christian is somebody who thinks beyond that and say,
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   "Even though I have the freedom to do that, it doesn't bother me,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   but because it will stumble some other people, I'm going to be careful."
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.400]   Again, Philippians 2, 1-4, "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ,
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.400]   if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit,
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.400]   if any affection of compassion, make my joy complete by being the same mind,
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.400]   maintain the same love, united in spirit, intent in one purpose."
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400]   Now, how do you do that?
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   He says, "If Christ means anything to you, be one in mind, compassionate,
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.400]   having same love in spirit."
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.400]   How do you do that?
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.400]   Well, 3 tells us.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400]   How do you become united?
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400]   "This is my preference, and this is what I desire.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.400]   I'm going to fill my life with people who agree and think the same way."
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400]   Is that how you become united?
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.400]   No.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   He says, "Do nothing from selfish ambition, selfishness, or empty conceit,
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   but with a humility of mind, regard one another as more important than yourself.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.400]   but also for the interests of others."
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   So if you're in a habit of not gathering with other people
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   because some other people who have different views,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   different personalities irritate you, you are a spiritual infant
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.400]   because you're not thinking about anybody else but yourself, right?
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   And so here it says you can't find unity in the church
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.400]   if every person in the church is saying, "This is what I think,"
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   and everybody needs to think and act the way I think and act.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   And I only want to surround myself with those people, right?
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400]   It says, "No, the only way that the church can be united,
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   especially as the church gets bigger and bigger,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.400]   if more and more people are unselfishly giving of themselves
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.400]   and considering others better than themselves."
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.400]   Now, we're not saying that there aren't times that we need to put our foot down
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.400]   and say, "This is the right doctrine.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   This is what the Bible teaches, and I can't change," right?
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:27.400]   But there's a lot of things that is simply your preference
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   that we need to consider others first, okay?
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   And the gathering of the church is a place where we practice that.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.400]   Third, biblical fellowship produces holiness, right?
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   Biblical fellowship produces holiness.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   Purpose of fellowship is to stir up one another on toward love and good deeds, right?
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.400]   Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.400]   not forsaking our own sympathy, as it have us some,
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   but encouraging one another all the more as you see the danger on it.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   Consider, right? Contemplate. Think about.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.400]   When you're gathering together, the word "stimulate" means to provoke very strongly
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.400]   that because of your presence, because of your relationship with that person,
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   that person is constantly provoked on toward love and good deeds, right?
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.400]   The purpose of fellowship is to carry each other's burdens.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.400]   And I'm going to get to this verse after I read it.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.400]   The ones who are spiritual needs to pursue those who are caught in sin, right?
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   And you can't do that if you're not gathering,
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.400]   and you don't know how other people are doing.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.400]   Like, my family's taken care of, my good friend's taken care of,
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.400]   my brother, my sister, so I'm good.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   But the purpose of the community is not just here's 5, 10, 15 friends
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   that I've committed myself, and then everybody else I can care less.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.400]   You can't build a biblical healthy church with that attitude, right?
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   Restoration must be done in spirit of gentleness.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   The pursuit must be done with self-awareness of your own shortcomings.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.400]   Bearing one another's burdens here means to bear the task of restoring a sinner to Christ.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   So biblical fellowship produces holiness.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.400]   To brethren, if anyone's caught in any trance by you who are spiritual, right?
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   Instead of being irritated and simply pointing fingers,
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   it says if you recognize the sin of other people, right?
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.400]   Instead of saying, "Why are they like that?" and pointing their fingers, right?
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400]   And immediately going to judge judgment,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.400]   it said the reaction should be to restore such a one in spirit of gentleness.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   Each one looking to yourself so that you too will not be tempted.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:37.400]   Bear one another's burdens, and therefore fulfill the law of Christ, right?
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   If you do regular Bible study on Wednesdays,
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   and you do not practice the love of Christ, right?
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   The Bible study is going to ruin you, right?
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.400]   It's going to ruin you because what humbles a Christian is the practice of love.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.400]   If you do not practice the love of Christ,
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.400]   the Word of God is going to make you an arrogant person
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.400]   because the Word of God is going to be like a light that shines on other people's sin,
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   on mistakes they're making, what are they doing, what they shouldn't be doing.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400]   That's what's going to happen.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   But what humbles us is in the context of loving people that are difficult to love.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.400]   It humbles us.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   It forces us to take the Word of God and to apply it in our lives,
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   and it neutralizes arrogance.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:30.400]   You cannot--arrogant people cannot love
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.400]   because to love somebody, you have to empty yourself.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   You have to learn to step in their shoes.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.400]   You have to learn to be patient.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   You have to accept their shortcomings,
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.400]   and you can't do that when you're filled with pride and stiff, right?
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.400]   And so the church, in order to fulfill the love of Christ,
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   it's not just study, we're going to go evangelize, all these things are important,
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.400]   but first and foremost is to bear each other's burdens.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   That's what it says, right?
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   Fourthly, biblical fellowship produces God-centered,
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   other-centered, holiness-producing community, right?
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   I'm going to touch upon this because of the time.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   1 Corinthians 12, 14 to 18, "For the body is not one member but many.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   If the foot says, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,'
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.400]   it is not for this reason any less part of the body.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.400]   And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,'
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.400]   it is not for this reason any less part of the body," right?
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.400]   He said God has deliberately given us different gifts.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   The frustration that we get into is that we look at someone else's gift
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.400]   and say, "I want that," right?
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   You may be the fastest person on your team,
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.400]   but then you end up coveting the tallest guy,
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   but I want to be the center.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:57.400]   So because you end up focusing your attention on what other people's gift is,
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.400]   you end up not being a good point guard, right?
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.400]   The speed that God gave you that that team needs,
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   you end up not functioning because you have your eye always on
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.400]   what the other guy has, right?
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   So he says, "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be?
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?"
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.400]   But now God has placed the members, each one of them in the body,
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   just as he desired, right?
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.400]   Just as he desired.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.400]   The gift that God has given you, God has given you uniquely.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   Some of you are better at other things than others,
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.400]   but every single person God made uniquely, right?
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   You have an unhealthy church.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.400]   An unhealthy church is always coveting this stage,
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.400]   whatever it may be, to lead worship, to preach, to teach.
