[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   Please turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 11.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.640]   We are finishing up this section before we head into chapter 12.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   We are only dealing with the very last verse, verse 36, but I want to read it again in context,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.360]   starting from verse 33 to 36.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.080]   Romans chapter 11, verse 33 to 36.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.960]   "Oh, the depth of the riches of wisdom and knowledge of God!
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.280]   How unsearchable are His judgments, and how inscrutable His ways!
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.760]   For who has known the mind of the Lord, and who has been His counselor?
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.260]   Or who has given a gift to Him that He might be repaid?
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.000]   For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.120]   To Him be the glory forever.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   Amen."
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.040]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.400]   Heavenly Father, we are gathered here together as a community, Lord God, to focus our attention
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.240]   on You, to thank You, to worship You, to express our adoration, Lord God, for who You are in
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.980]   our lives.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.920]   I pray as we are studying through the book of Romans that what You have intended for
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.640]   the original readers, Lord, help us to glean and understand.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.120]   We know, Father, that Your truth requires more than our minds to understand, that it
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.240]   is spiritually discerned.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.360]   So help us, Lord God, to be humbled that Your Holy Spirit will continue to speak and convict
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.480]   in our hearts, to see if there's any hurtful ways in us, that we will be corrected, sanctified,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.720]   and that we would become more and more each day what You desire us to be, people who will
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.480]   worship You in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.880]   So we ask that You will bless us this morning.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.480]   Amen.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.960]   One of the blessings of being bicultural is that you're able to see things from different
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   perspectives.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.280]   And, you know, this is something that I, when I was younger, I really didn't appreciate
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   because, and I think I've expressed to you when I was younger, you know, when I came
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.520]   to the United States, living in Kansas, Georgia, Philadelphia, and just moving all over the
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.760]   place, I never felt like I fit in anywhere.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.240]   And I always wanted to be able to say that this is my hometown, this is where I'm from,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.800]   and these are my roots.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.160]   And I don't, I can't say that because I've never been in one place longer than a certain
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.420]   period of time.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380]   But as I got older, I realized the benefit of that, that I'm able to see things from
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.560]   a different perspective, you know, and I've pretty much lived in the Midwest, in the South,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.800]   in the East Coast, in the West Coast, back in Korea, back and forth.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.120]   And again, one of the benefits of moving around so much and being bicultural is, again, you
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.800]   get to see things from different perspectives.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.480]   But one of the things that, again, the paradigm shift or the way that we look at things is
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.240]   so radically different is our Christian perspective versus the worldly perspective.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.760]   And there are some things that are absolutely contradictory, that you can't possibly understand
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   unless there has been a regeneration in your heart.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   You know, just basic things that you know, where Jesus says that if you want to live,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.000]   you need to pick up your cross and deny yourself.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.280]   If you want to be great, you have to learn to be the servant of all.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.360]   It's completely contradictory to what we know in this life.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.880]   We are taught since we were young that the reason why you get education, the reason why
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.300]   you work hard, the reason why you get promotion, all of it is to elevate ourselves.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.280]   We might not use those words, but that's how this world works.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.200]   You're trying to be better than your neighbors.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   But Jesus tells us exactly the opposite, that we ought to be servants.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.360]   We have to humble ourselves, be less.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.440]   Here's a passage that I want to introduce to you that, again, we may just read it, but
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.200]   when we think about it in the worldly context, it'd be very difficult to understand if you
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.680]   didn't have a Christian perspective.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.800]   In Psalm 144, 3-4, it says, "O Lord, what is man that you regard him, or the son of
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.320]   man that you think of him?"
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.520]   So let me stop right there.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.880]   The psalmist is asking, what value do we have?
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   So he's already stating, why is it important?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.160]   Why do you even care about us?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.360]   Man is like a breath.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   His days are like a passing shadow.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.120]   He's expressing, if you really take a careful look at who we are, all we are is a simple
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.440]   breath that comes and goes.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.160]   We all have to acknowledge that.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   But the whole culture that you and I live in is to elevate, like, no, you have value.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.800]   You're important.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080]   And to build up your self-esteem.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.920]   But the psalmist says, we're nothing.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.240]   We're just a breath.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.840]   Why do you even care?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.000]   Consider that with a paradigm in our generation.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800]   Why don't you care?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.240]   All this stuff is happening, and why don't you care?
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   Why aren't you doing anything?
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.720]   Versus the psalmist who says, why do you even care?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.200]   Psalm 139, 4-5, it says, "O Lord, make me know my end."
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   How many of us have sat there and thought to ourselves, it's like, "Well, I want to
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   know when I'm going to die."
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   That's what he says.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.320]   Make me know my end, and what is the measure of my days?
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.360]   Let me know how fleeting I am.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.280]   He's not asking, "Let me know how precious I am in your sight.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.800]   Let me know how much you love me."
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   He doesn't say that.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.160]   He says, "Let me know how fleeting my days are.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   Behold, you have made my days a few hand-breaths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.360]   Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath."
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.620]   We were meant to be worshippers rather than, again, that's part of my notes.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.320]   Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.600]   The whole purpose of the psalmist in the end is to come before God and say, "Lord, help
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.760]   me to realize how insignificant I am."
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.520]   Think about how contrary to that, to everything that we are taught in our culture, in our
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.080]   generation, sometimes even in the church.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   You're precious.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   God loves you.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080]   God's not sawing you.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.160]   But the psalmist comes before God and said, "Let me know that I am worthless.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.300]   Let me realize just how fleeting my life is and how insignificant I am in your eyes."
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.300]   Why does he say that?
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.520]   In Psalm 90, 12, it says, "So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   wisdom."
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.320]   He said, "Wisdom begins by recognizing what we are not."
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.000]   Some of us have been told all our life just how precious you are.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.720]   And I'm not saying that that's bad.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:50.360]   But we have this paradigm, even as we approach God, that you owe me.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.480]   When we pray to God and God doesn't answer our prayers, so what?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.600]   Why does he need to answer your prayers?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.200]   Why does he need to answer my prayers?
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.640]   If I get sick and God, why don't you answer my prayer?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.520]   Why does he have to answer our prayers?
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   Who are you?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.120]   Who am I?
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.280]   If I get fired from a job, Lord, give me a job.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   And he doesn't give me a job.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   He's like, "Why?
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   Why do you not help me with this?"
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   Why does he have to help you?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.120]   Who are you?
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   Who am I?
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.800]   We're just a breath.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.560]   We just come, we disappear.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.240]   The psalmist says the beginning of wisdom is recognizing the insignificance of who we
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.800]   are.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   And the reason why he says that's the beginning of wisdom is because the whole purpose of
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:48.460]   why you and I have been created was not to be the object of worship, but to be worshipers.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.880]   We were not meant to be.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.960]   We were not created to be objects of worship.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:02.120]   And yet, think about the whole trajectory of our life is trying to be worshipped, trying
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:08.640]   to be better, get ahead in life, want to be a little bit taller, a little bit skinnier,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   a little bit faster, a little bit better than everything else.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.000]   For what purpose?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.600]   We might not use the word worship because that's blasphemy, but at the core of our paradigm
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.280]   is we are working hard to become objects of worship.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.200]   Why we pay so much attention to our hair?
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.400]   Why we pay so much attention to our careers?
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.760]   To all that we do?
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.620]   Because there's innate rebellion in mankind.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.600]   So the beginning of wisdom is recognizing who we are in light of who God is.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:45.920]   That's why Ecclesiastes 12, 13, at the end of Solomon's full life, experiencing everything,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   getting everything that a human being could possibly imagine, there's no sports figure
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   at the top of his game ever experienced what King Solomon experienced.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.760]   Michael Jordan may have all the adoration, he had all the skills and respect and maybe
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.800]   even all the money, but he never had the power that Solomon did, where he could have just
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.400]   gathered concubines and whatever he wanted.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.760]   He could make law and get rid of laws.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.280]   This guy had access.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.280]   Not only did he have all that, he was the wisest man on earth.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   He had the intellect.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.120]   So you could think of anything that you could possibly desire in this world, he had access
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.000]   to and the whole book of Ecclesiastes is a written document of his experiences and at
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.120]   the end of his life he says, "The end of the matter, all has been heard.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.640]   Fear God and keep his commandment for this is the whole duty of it."
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.600]   See if we don't recognize who we are, we're not going to fear God.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.760]   He becomes our servant.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   We're not his servants.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.040]   He says the end goal, the totality of life that he's experienced, he says, is to fear
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.880]   God and keep his commandment.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.760]   Now Paul says it in a different way in the same passage in verse 36 where he says, "In
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.720]   summary of 11 chapters of gospel preaching, before we get into the imperatives, he said
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.880]   in light of this mercy you ought to live this way, the very last statement that summarizes
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.160]   almost everything that he says is, "To him be the glory forever.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   Amen."
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.120]   To him be the glory forever.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.200]   Amen.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.320]   That's basically in essence what Solomon was saying at the end of chapter 12 in Ecclesiastes.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.160]   The end goal of man is to recognize God, fear God, and then to obey him.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.560]   To give him all the glory.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.200]   You know the word for glory in the Old Testament is kabod and the literal meaning of that is
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.800]   weightiness.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.360]   And you could see that.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.920]   Old Testament is a revelation of the glory of God and whenever God's glory is revealed
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.520]   there's a sense of weightiness, seriousness.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.440]   Whenever God would show up there would be fear, maybe even terror.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.400]   And you see that in the tabernacle, you see that in the clouds, you see that in the Shekinah
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.280]   glory, you see that at the giving of the law, you see that even as he carries out his judgment.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.600]   Whenever God appears there's a sense of weightiness and seriousness.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.440]   And that's the word for glory in the Old Testament in Hebrew, kabod.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.400]   In the New Testament the word for glory is interesting.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.200]   It's doxa.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.400]   Doxa literally means opinion or thinking.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.720]   So the word in and of itself doesn't really describe anything in particular.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.080]   All it means is your thoughts, your opinions.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:39.840]   Now that's a strange word to use to describe a heavy word like glory in the New Testament,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.960]   doxa.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:49.360]   The word doxa, you probably know this word, I mean orthodox is again a combination of
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   two words.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.840]   Ortho means to straight, doxa is thought.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.120]   So orthodox is straight thinking, right?
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.160]   And we should use the word orthodox of right doctrine, right?
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.120]   That's where we get the word glory, doxa.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   Or paradox.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.280]   The word paradox means to be above, to be above thinking.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.460]   So paradox is something that is beyond comprehension, paradox, beyond thinking, beyond understanding.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.560]   So something that you can't simply comprehend by using logic, we call that a paradox.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.640]   So the word in and of itself could be positive or negative.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.560]   So what's interesting about even the word glory in the Old Testament, New Testament,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.280]   the Old Testament word for glory is kabod, and whenever God showed up there was a sense
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   of weightiness.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.160]   And so at the end, if you were an Old Testament saint, when you thought about God, you thought
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.040]   of something very serious, weighty, heavy.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.640]   Whether that would be his deliverance or whether that would be his judgment, it would be something
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.320]   very weighty and heavy.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.720]   I don't know if you guys still use that word now, but when I was younger, and maybe you
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.800]   still use it, but whenever you heard something profound, the hippies would say, "Dude, that's
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   heavy."
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.080]   Do you guys still use that?
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   My guess is no.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.480]   So back in the '70s and the '80s, they would say, "Well, that's heavy."
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.200]   Meaning that's so profound.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.080]   And again, that's the word in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament, it's simply to be
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.840]   revealed, to be displayed.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.440]   Now I thought that was really interesting because in the New Testament, the way God
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.640]   revealed himself was through the display of Christ.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:41.320]   He came taken on very common form, human form, that initially you wouldn't even recognize
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.560]   him as the Son of God.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:51.200]   His revelation was gradual, and then the climax of his revelation, we recognize on the cross
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.060]   and his resurrection.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.260]   But in the New Testament, God simply displayed himself.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.720]   That in the Old Testament, it was a shadow.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.880]   In the New Testament, it was like an HD version of who God is, and we were able to see him
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.440]   clearly.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   So the word glory in and of itself is simply God's nature on display.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.720]   That's the meaning of that word.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.560]   Now the significance between all of this and giving God the glory is in the Old Testament,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.880]   in the New Testament, when the disciples asked him to teach us how to pray, Jesus said, "Pray
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   this way.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.800]   Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.040]   So the very first statement is recognizing God as God.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.760]   Recognizing God as God.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.960]   May his name be hallowed.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.880]   Before we are concerned about our life, our sustenance, our well-being, our safety, he
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.320]   says, "Let his name be hallowed."
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.480]   And then the second thing he says, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   heaven."
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.040]   So all that is happening in heaven.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.880]   All the reality in heaven made happen here.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   He said, "Make that your first prayer."
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   That's basically in essence what Solomon would say in Ecclesiastes, that's the end of his
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   life.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.800]   The chief end of man is to fear God and keep his commandment.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.600]   Paul says it's the end of Romans.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:23.400]   He says the totality of the gospel, "Let his name be glorified."
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.560]   Jesus said in his prayer, "To hallowed be his name.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.640]   Let his kingdom come."
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.320]   Not our kingdom.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.120]   How much of our frustration in our life happens because we are in conflict with his kingdom
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   and his will in our life?
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   He said, "Let his kingdom come."
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.760]   And everything that's happening in heaven, let it be done here.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.960]   So those of us who have been studying, again, through the book of Revelation, every time
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.120]   we see a glimpse of heaven, what's happening up there?
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.320]   You don't need to answer because I've mentioned this several times already.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.760]   Every time we see a glimpse of what's happening in heaven, what is happening up there?
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.920]   Worship.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.320]   All throughout the book of Revelation, we see scenes of the elders, of the holy creatures,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:16.000]   of the saints, of the angels, of the 144,000 Jews and multitudes behind them.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.160]   Every time we get a glimpse of the throne of God, they are in worship.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:26.200]   So when Jesus says, "Pray this way, our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:33.000]   holy and honored and feared and glorified are thy name, let your kingdom come here."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.680]   Why does his kingdom have to come here?
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.820]   Because this kingdom down here is in rebellion against God.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.940]   So that's a prayer.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.560]   That's a prayer of battle.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.860]   That let your kingdom come and be established here and that what's happening up there happen
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.440]   down here, which is worship.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   So the primary call to mankind is worship.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.540]   You and I were not created to be objects of worship, but to be worshipers.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.360]   And the main reason why we face frustration in our lives is because we have that thing
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.520]   completely reversed.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.880]   We have it completely reversed.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.600]   Now let me ask you, how much would it affect your life if you didn't have to worry about
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.320]   what other people thought of you?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.680]   Like at all.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.160]   You probably save a lot of time in the morning, right?
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.640]   Worry about how your face looks, about certain clothes you wear.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.240]   There's a lot of things you wouldn't do if you didn't care at all what other people thought.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.440]   What kind of car you drove.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:51.040]   I mean, as long as you can eat and live and have a family and have life and friends and
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.960]   practice love, right?
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.920]   I think that would be it.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.360]   But so much of our frustration in life is because we care a lot about what other people
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.100]   think and there's not a single person in here that's like, "Well, I'm not that."
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.780]   Every single one of us wrestles with that.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.660]   How much freedom would you feel?
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.740]   How much of anxiousness would disappear?
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.500]   How much of your friendships?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:26.020]   If you just didn't care at all about what other people thought, about what your parents
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.460]   thought, what your friends thought, what your husband thought, what your wife thought, what
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.500]   your friends, your neighbors thought.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.140]   I mean, it would take away a lot of weight in our lives.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.460]   See, God didn't create us to be objects of worship.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.180]   It's not fitting for us.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.980]   It doesn't fit us well because that's not who we are and everything that we do to try
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:56.700]   to be objects of worship, it just causes more frustration.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.700]   God created us to be worshipers.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.180]   See, he's not saying, "Hey, let it be about me."
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.740]   God's not saying, "I've heard stories about celebrities and famous people saying that
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.220]   I stopped going to church because God is an egomaniac.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   When I first heard that God is seeking his own glory, I mean, he said, "Okay, instead
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.140]   of me," he said, "give him the glory," and he said, "He's an egomaniac.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.060]   I can't worship an egomaniac."
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:31.980]   You see, it is when he is worshipped we feel alive.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.060]   You know, last Sunday, I know that we had a wedding, right?
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:41.260]   Tim and Sarah had a wedding and a bunch of guys were watching the Dodgers baseball, and
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:46.420]   I know that there was a grand slam that was hit right in the middle of the—not the ceremony,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420]   but at the reception.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.780]   And I wasn't watching, so I didn't know what was going on, but there was an instantaneous
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.980]   worship that was happening at the corner, and I had no idea what happened.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.180]   So I thought maybe there was a rat or maybe something good, maybe some, you know, the
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.320]   snacks came out or the cake was so delicious and they instantaneously yelled in one voice,
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.060]   but something spectacular happened in the corner.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.220]   And we all turned around, whether we were watching the game or not, we all turned around
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.700]   to look, and then eventually we had to, "What happened over there?"
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.180]   Then eventually we found out that one of the Dodgers players hit a grand slam, and eventually
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.340]   as a result of that, that they ended up winning the game.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.780]   So, you know, this is in the context of Chasing the World Series, so it was a huge game.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:37.700]   But instantaneously, instantaneously, there was an eruption of worship.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.180]   And I bet you at that moment, there was not a frown in that circle.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.120]   For that moment, nobody was thinking about how hungry they were, nobody was thinking
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.620]   about the human problems that they may have had, nobody was thinking about anything other
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:01.380]   than just the elation of just watching.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.300]   I mean, how did it personally benefit you?
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.180]   Do you get money because they hit a grand slam?
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.300]   What did you get out of it, other than you're a fan?
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.680]   You're just a fan.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.020]   And because you're a fan, when that happened, you're filled with joy.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.700]   And I bet a lot of you talked about it afterwards.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   It wasn't just there.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:27.380]   I bet you today, you know, you're still talking about it with your friends, with other fans.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.180]   Why were you so happy?
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.700]   Why were thousands, hundreds of thousands of people so happy about what some other guy
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.460]   did?
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.800]   Why does that make you so happy?
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:46.860]   Why are people willing to pay $1,000 for the cheapest World Series tickets?
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.940]   That's what I heard on the radio, cheapest, like cheap seats are going to start selling
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.020]   for $1,000.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.620]   Why would people pay that kind of money to watch a bunch of guys run around on the field
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.660]   throwing strange objects?
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.260]   Because you're a fan.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.460]   It makes you feel alive.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.740]   You are willing to quit your job.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.740]   Not quit your job, but miss your work, right?
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.800]   What else would you spend $1,000 for?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   Because it makes you happy.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.020]   It makes you feel alive.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.940]   See, God created us to be worshipers.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.080]   Imagine if you went to this game and paid $1,000 and you're pouting because nobody's
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.740]   looking at you.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.460]   You know, you dressed up so nicely and combed your hair and put on the best shoes and you
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.220]   walked in and nobody's paying any attention to you.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.180]   All they're doing is interested in the game.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.900]   Imagine how ridiculous that would seem.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.220]   Why did you come into this stadium?
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.580]   This stadium was for the purpose of watching this game.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.340]   You see, God created us to be His image bearers.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.940]   See, the first thing that He says, He said, "God deserves the glory because He is the
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.380]   originator of all things."
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.300]   He says, "From Him," that's the first thing He says, "From Him."
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.540]   The reason why He deserves to get the glory is because all things are from Him.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.260]   Revelation 411, "Worthy are you, our Lord, our God, to receive glory and honor and power,
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:31.940]   for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.060]   Because He created it.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060]   He's the creator.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.820]   Colossians 116 and 17, "For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.420]   and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority, all things were created
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   through Him and for Him, and He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together."
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.660]   He deserves the glory because He is the originator of all things.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:02.260]   How short-sighted we are in Romans chapter 1 when it says that God put His imprint, His
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:09.180]   glory upon creation, and we see creation and we glorify the people.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:13.380]   Every time I go to the Great Wall, people pay thousands of dollars to come and see this
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.180]   Great Wall because it's supposed to be so long.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:23.580]   It took hundreds of years, 500 years to make, and so many people gave their lives, and there's
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.820]   a rich history behind it.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:31.780]   But every time I go there, it reminds me, like, look at the mountain that it sits on.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.660]   Look at the hills that it sits on.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:40.820]   And we travel over there, we look at the rocks that were piled up, and we glory on the piled
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.220]   rocks, and then we completely forget about what it's sitting on.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.580]   You don't look at a painting and then worship the paint.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.780]   Look at that paint.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.380]   Look at the way it dried.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.380]   Look at the canvas, right?
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.100]   No, you give credit to the painter.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   See, but that's the insanity of mankind, that we look at the universe, and clearly there
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:20.740]   is a Creator, and we give credit to man.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.300]   First and foremost, it says He deserved the glory because He's the Creator.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:31.000]   In Genesis 1, 26 and 27, it says, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image.'
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.460]   He made us in His image, not Him in our image.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:40.280]   For God created man in His own image, and in the image of God, He created Him."
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.640]   We were the canvas.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:49.880]   We were the canvas that He painted on, and He put imprint of Himself on us.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:57.120]   So the man who is seeking glory for himself is no different than a painting who is sad
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:05.140]   that the observers are not recognizing the quality of the paint, the quality of the canvas.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.000]   You completely missed the whole point.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.580]   In Genesis 9, 6, it says, "Whoever sheds blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.240]   For God made man in His own image."
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:28.420]   So the whole reason why murder is an egregious sin is because of innate value of mankind.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.520]   You're not going to go to jail for killing an ant.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.120]   Well, it has life.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.960]   Plant, we call it living.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.560]   We eat cows every day, right?
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.560]   If you're not a vegan.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.600]   Fish, they all have life.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.080]   Why do we not call that murder?
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.480]   Like PETA does, right?
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.760]   But most of the world would not consider that murder.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.080]   Most of the world would not have an issue with that.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   Why not?
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   Well, the Bible says because we have innate value.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.620]   Where did this innate value come from?
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.360]   Because we were created in the image of God.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.740]   Because our Creator's imprint is on humankind.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.920]   So our very value comes from the fact that we were created by Him and put His imprint
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.520]   on us.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.800]   He deserved the glory.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.400]   See, but in the immediate context that you and I are looking at, it's not just talking
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   about creation.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.840]   Paul is talking about the gospel itself.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.560]   Not only is he the author of creation, he is the author of recreation, which is the
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   gospel.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.960]   He initiated the first creation, and because of our fall, he also initiated our recreation.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.080]   In Ephesians 1, 4-6, it says, "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.480]   that we should be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   In love, He predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ according to His purpose and
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:57.960]   will, to praise of His glorious grace with which He has blessed us in the beloved."
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.600]   He says from the very beginning, not only creation, the physical world, but the recreation
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.640]   of the spiritual to bring us back to life, is that He is the author of that.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.600]   You and I don't get the credit.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.800]   You and I don't get to say, "You know what?
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.960]   God did His part and I did mine.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.760]   Thank God that I had enough sense to go to church when I did.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.800]   Thank God I had enough sense to ask the right questions."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   Even for our creation and for our recreation, God deserves all the credit.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.440]   There's nothing else that you and I did.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.880]   That's why He says, "From Him, from Him, we glorify Him."
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.360]   Again, Ephesians 5, 25-27, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.840]   gave Himself for her that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.740]   water with the Word, so that He may present the church to Himself in splendor without
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.880]   spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish."
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.560]   So from the very get-go, our salvation was initiated by Him.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.520]   So He deserved the glory because He is the initiator.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   He is the creator.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.080]   Secondly, God deserves the glory because He is the sustainer of all things.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:16.640]   Colossians 1:17, it says, "He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together."
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.200]   In Him, all things hold together.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.520]   Acts 17, 28, "For in Him we live and move and have our being."
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.160]   Our very existence depends on Him.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.520]   I think a simple way to describe hell is right now is not hell.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:37.200]   No matter how hard life may be, this is nowhere near hell.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:44.040]   Because every human being, Christian or non-Christian, experiences what we call common grace.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.040]   God sustains our universe.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.880]   He allows you to experience goodness.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.200]   Christian and non-Christians also experience love.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.120]   You experience joy.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.240]   You experience family.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.900]   This is not hell.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.800]   God is the sustainer of all things.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.980]   Not only did He create it, not only is He responsible for the recreation, but everything
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.320]   that you and I know is because God is sustaining us.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.360]   Think about it.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.400]   Are you living because you willed to live?
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.440]   You can't will yourself to live.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.680]   You can't will yourself to have enough oxygen.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.160]   If you have a heart problem, you don't will yourself to have a better heart.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.560]   You don't will yourself to make sure that political...
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.840]   I mean, who knows?
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.000]   A nuclear bomb goes off, you get hit by a car, or the universe just gets too hot, or
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.920]   it gets too cold, or you get infected by some disease.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.120]   I know, this may sound morbid, but you and I don't have control over any of that.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.520]   But again, the insanity of mankind is we wake up every day thinking it's us.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.080]   That's why Jesus says, "You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me."
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.580]   You can't survive physically, and neither can you survive spiritually.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.200]   He deserves all the glory because not only is it all from Him, but He says it is all
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.520]   through Him.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.160]   In Hebrews 12, too, it says, "Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.080]   who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and seated
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.960]   at the right hand of God, right under the throne of God."
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:33.320]   He is the founder and the sustainer and the perfecter.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.480]   There's so much attention on the justification of our salvation.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   And then when it comes to our sanctification, we have a tendency to think, "Well, if I read
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.000]   the Bible enough, if I attend the right church, if I sit under the right teaching, that somehow
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.960]   sanctification is just going to happen if I will myself."
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.280]   No.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:00.540]   Even the bearing of fruit, we're completely dependent on Him.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.840]   Everything that you and I know is completely dependent on Him.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.600]   He deserves the glory because every single one of us is here because somehow God is allowing
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   you.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.760]   Do you understand when we open up the scriptures, it made sense to you?
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.180]   Because some of you may remember what the Word of God sounded like before you became
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   a Christian.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.000]   Some of you guys may remember that.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.940]   Reading the Bible, nothing made any sense to you.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.420]   It sounded like gibberish.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.760]   Maybe it sounded like instructions on how to put together IKEA furniture that you have
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.060]   no intent of ever putting it together.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.840]   So you just have no interest in it.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.560]   Some of it, it just didn't make any sense to you.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.440]   But God opened your eyes.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.520]   It didn't make any sense to you, but now it does.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Why?
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   What happened?
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.960]   Did you just become smarter one day?
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.160]   Did one day you just learn how to do better math and you put it together and it just made
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   sense to you?
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   No.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   God had mercy.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   And the whole reason why we are able to understand, why we're able to study the Bible, why we're
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.880]   able to pray and understand even what I'm saying to you is because God is allowing it.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.560]   He's softening your heart.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   He deserves all the glory.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.240]   In fact, one of my favorite verses, Romans 8.32, it says, "He who did not spare his own
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:20.120]   son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us everything?"
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.920]   How will he not along with him give us everything?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.080]   If he loved us enough to send his only begotten son, will he not love us enough to sustain
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.760]   us?
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.320]   That's where we have assurance of salvation.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.420]   It's because of him.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.040]   It starts with him and everything is sustained by him.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.760]   "Knowing all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.840]   For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.080]   nor things to come, nor powers, nor heights, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.280]   will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:05.320]   The reason why we are sustained is because we are held in his hands of love.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.260]   Everything is from him and everything is sustained through him.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:16.360]   But finally, God deserves the glory because he is the ultimate goal of all things.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.180]   He is the ultimate goal.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:22.460]   It is not simply through him, but it is also to him.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.660]   First Corinthians 8.6, "Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.900]   things and for whom we exist."
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.120]   He doesn't exist for us.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.780]   We exist for him.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.340]   So most of you guys took BCC.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:44.020]   The first and the most important vision of BCC is what?
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.700]   God-centered worship, not man-centered.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.300]   Nobody's nodding their head.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.580]   God-centered worship, not man-centered.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:57.940]   That's the most important part of our church vision.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.140]   We don't cater to, "Oh, what do you want?
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.140]   What makes you happy?
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.020]   What makes you feel comfortable?"
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:08.700]   The most important question in the church ought to be, "What does God desire?
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   What does God want?
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.600]   How does he want to be worshipped?"
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.140]   So whether it is preaching or teaching or the organization of the church or the decision
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.420]   that's being made, all of it is first and foremost to honor God because all things are
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.460]   not just from him, through him, but is also to him.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.980]   It's for him.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.120]   He is the goal of our salvation.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:35.620]   And that's the part that if we don't understand, we can still, recognizing he's a creator,
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.180]   recognizing he's a sustainer, but if we don't recognize the third part, we can still live
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:45.700]   all our lives using him to glorify ourselves.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.220]   Does that happen in church?
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.740]   All the time.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.060]   I can stand up on the pulpit here to glorify myself.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.780]   I just found a new avenue.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.020]   Instead of making a lot of money, clearly I can't play basketball.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.140]   I'm not going to make money playing basketball or any particular sport.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.300]   Maybe wrestling, I had some chance, but clearly I wasn't going to be a professional basketball
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   player.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.340]   And it's much harder to make a billion dollars.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.060]   They already made Facebook.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.820]   Amazon already exists.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.260]   Google was here long before.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.580]   They made a computer before I even recognized what it was.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.740]   So all that stuff is just too hard.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.700]   So I could easily come into the ministry, stand in front of a lot of people to glorify
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   myself.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.140]   That could happen.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.980]   It could happen in a smaller scale in the church.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.560]   Every decision that we make, everything that we do, we can use God.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.740]   We can lead worship.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.060]   We can be on the praise team.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.540]   We can stand on a stage.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.640]   Or even other things.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.120]   If we don't recognize the third part of this, everything's from him, everything's through
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.280]   him, ultimately for me.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.320]   Ultimately for me, so that I can have a better life, so that I can be happy.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.120]   No, he says all things are to him.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.980]   It's for him.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.280]   We exist for him, him not for us.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.360]   Romans 5, 10 through 11, "For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.800]   the death of his son, how much more now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.240]   will, his life?
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.380]   More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.920]   now received reconciliation."
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:27.960]   So the goal of our salvation is to be reconciled with God.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   If I got in a fight with my wife and I said, "Oh, reconcile," because I sent her a letter.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.080]   Would you consider that reconciliation?
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.120]   Reconciliation is I have an ongoing relationship with my wife.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   That's what I would consider reconciliation.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.960]   It's like, "Oh, I did something wrong."
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   It's like, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.880]   Then I just go live my own life.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   That's my wife.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.760]   And you ask me, "Where is he?"
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   "Where does she live?"
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.760]   I don't know.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   "What does she want?"
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.440]   But we're reconciled.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:05.320]   Lot of Christian relationship that we have with God is no different than that.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   We've been justified, but there is no personal relationship with the Father.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.280]   And that's why prayer is so strange to nominal Christians.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.160]   You can study the Bible because your knowledge increases and you can immediately show if
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.560]   your knowledge increased.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.120]   But this one particular activity of prayer, unless you're going to walk around with a
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.600]   dot on your head and say, "I prayed this morning," and then you put 10 minutes or 30 minutes
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.680]   so that people can see, unless you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   won't be able to pray because that's just like closing your eyes, doing nothing for
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.880]   20 minutes, especially in our generation.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.840]   You can't get into a restaurant with some noise going on.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.380]   You can't get into your car without something turned on.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.400]   You can't sit for five minutes without the phone being turned on and going through Facebook.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:05.480]   So sitting quietly, talking to somebody that you don't know for more than just a few seconds
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   is torture.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.800]   Nominal Christians can't pray.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   No matter how much we emphasize how important it is, you can't pray.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.300]   You can only pray if He really is your refuge.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.720]   You will only pray if you really think He's your hope.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.120]   You can only pray if you really have a personal relationship with Him.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:36.040]   But when you do, my gosh, it changes everything.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.760]   There's nothing that is hopeless.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.520]   There's nothing that is hopeless because a sovereign God, you have access to the sovereign
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   God.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.560]   You have a personal relationship with the sovereign God.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:54.320]   So the whole purpose of the gospel is to reconcile with us because every problem that you and
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.520]   I have is because we've been disconnected with the author of life.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.160]   So salvation is only a legal contract.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.240]   You missed the whole point of salvation because the whole benefit of salvation is to know
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.800]   Jesus.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:22.320]   Everything is from Him, everything is through Him, and ultimately everything is to Him.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.760]   The whole reason why the door has been opened is so that we can enter the throne of grace
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.600]   with confidence.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.040]   Why do we enter the throne of grace?
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.960]   Because that's where Christ is seated.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.840]   Because that's where He is.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.360]   So if our pursuit is not Christ, you missed the whole point.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.760]   If our pursuit of Bible study is not Christ, you missed the whole point.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.720]   If our pursuit and our fellowship is just so that we can have friends, you missed the
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.600]   whole point because the point of fellowship is to draw near to Christ.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.520]   The point of evangelism is to point people to Christ.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.560]   The point of worship is to exalt Christ.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.640]   The point of Bible study is to know Christ.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.880]   All things are from Him, through Him, and to Him.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:16.160]   And let me summarize all that Paul has been saying in these simple words.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.720]   As I wrap up, Psalm 19, it says, "Heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.560]   proclaims His handiwork."
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:29.000]   All that God created declares His glory.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.840]   But in Romans chapter 119, it says, "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:41.080]   God has shown it to them, and yet mankind decided not to give Him the glory."
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.560]   God displayed His glory.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.680]   Mankind chooses not to give Him glory.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.560]   In Romans 3:23, it says, "All have sinned and fall short of," what?
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.880]   "The glory of God."
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:42:00.240]   So His creation is the display of His glory.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.080]   His rebellion is to refuse the acknowledgment of His glory.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:10.800]   The man's sin is described as falling short of His glory.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.360]   So what was salvation?
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   Is to display His glory in a greater way on the cross.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:29.880]   If glory is what we fell short of, it is glory that must be reestablished.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:35.720]   And when His glory is reestablished, when we are in the presence of His glory, what
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.680]   happens to us?
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.800]   We become worshippers.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.720]   Book of Revelation chapter 21, 22, we are not there yet, but heaven is described as
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.320]   a place that is no need of the sun.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:55.160]   And the reason why is because it's that God's glory is going to light up heaven.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.680]   His glory is going to be so plainly seen.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.640]   We're going to become worshippers.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.320]   Worship ultimately is not something that you and I stir up.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.720]   Worship is a response, just like the people watching baseball, right?
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.960]   Pure worship.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.440]   Pure worship.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.000]   Nobody had to be tucked into it.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.160]   Nobody said, "Hey, let's get in line.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   Hey, stand in a circle.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.560]   I'm going to high five and then you high five him."
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.520]   There was no organization in that.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:31.680]   It was just an eruption of pure joy when they saw something spectacular.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.420]   That's how worship is described in heaven.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:42.100]   In the presence of His glory being revealed, we will erupt in worship.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.440]   What you and I are experiencing now is a glimpse of that.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.080]   And that's what Romans chapter 12, that'll take us into Romans chapter 12.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:55.240]   He says, "I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:02.720]   as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship."
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.960]   All that Paul has been saying has been leading up to chapter 12.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:13.600]   All of the display of His grace, of His mercy, of His holiness, His judgment, His patience,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:21.160]   all the gospel, chapter 1 through chapter 11, is to bring us to chapter 12, therefore,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.720]   that we may become worshipers.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.600]   Ultimate purpose of the cross is so that we may worship.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.280]   Again, I hope that will kind of set the tone for us.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.640]   You know, I know whenever we jump into the imperatives, you know, there's always a segment
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.520]   of the church where it's like, "Oh, I feel burdened."
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:46.080]   You know, let's just talk about the cross, not recognizing the point of the cross is
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.480]   to cause us to worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   So as we invite our worship team to come back up, again, I want to ask you guys to take
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.120]   some time to really come before the Lord in prayer.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.560]   Whenever you pray, pray very specifically.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   Don't pray in generalities.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.720]   I want to be a better person.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.680]   I want to be a better Christian.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.440]   Pray specifically.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.400]   Like a surgeon who needs to get to the problem, be specific.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.720]   What areas are you compromising?
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.520]   What sins have you swept under the rug?
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.000]   What are things that you're not dealing with?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.960]   Come before the Lord.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:27.280]   In light of His mercy, how can I become, how can I be a better worshiper?
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.080]   How can I respond reasonably?
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.760]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leaves.
