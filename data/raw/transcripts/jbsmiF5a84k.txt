[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   >> All right. Good morning. Amen.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   Okay. So you guys know what I'm talking about. Okay.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   Better than last week, but we'll see the full number coming in. Okay.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   So you are the faithful remnants. Okay.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   All right. God is patient with us, so we need to be patient.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   Let me give you a couple of announcements before we get started.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   Next Sunday, we have communion service schedule.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   So again, every communion that we have, it's important, the significance of it,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   and it's meant for us to focus our attention upon Christ and what He has done.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   And so, you know, we don't want to participate in a kind of nonchalant and unworthy manner.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   And so we want you guys to prepare your hearts.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   And so that communion service, again, is next Sunday.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   So please prepare for that.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   The other thing is spiritual development courses.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   So we have two classes that are starting on August 21st.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   And so OT survey, which is being taught by Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   If you're not taking the OT survey, OT survey or the NT survey classes,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   I strongly recommend that you guys take this class because
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   so much of what you are studying in the New Testament is connected to what's happening in the Old Testament.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   It's a fulfillment of some of the, a lot of the things that are happening in the Old Testament.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   So if you have a vague understanding of the Old Testament,
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.320]   you can still understand the New Testament, but you're going to have a much shallower understanding.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   And so if you have, if you're not exactly sure about the timeline,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   about why the prophets are there and what is the content of this thing,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   I strongly recommend, it's a four week class.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   It's taught at 2 p.m.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   So you have time for you to go and grab lunch and come back.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   And it's about an hour long for four weeks.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   And so if you haven't taken that, I strongly encourage you to take that.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   The other class being taught by Pastor Mark, that's also starting on 8/21,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   but it is only for three weeks, one hour at a time.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   And this is basically going over how to do inductive Bible study.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   I know that those of you who've come to our church and you're not used to doing inductive Bible study,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   it's intimidating because to open up the Bible and then, and then instead of asking us,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   what does this mean, you kind of dig through the scriptures yourself and it takes some time.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   So it's not, it's not complicated, but it does require some commitment that we don't just, you know,
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   we don't just open up the scripture and then see what the Lord has to say today.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   And then it's like, oh, you know, this is what he means.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   We don't approach any other literature that way.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   And we shouldn't approach the Bible that way, right?
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   The Bible is written from the beginning to the end for a specific purpose.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   And so we want to understand what he meant and how the early church understood that.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   And so in order to do that, we want to do inductive Bible study.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   So if you have a difficult time doing inductive Bible study,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   or if you're new to the church and you've never done that before,
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   I strongly recommend you take that class and that will help you with the other things that we're doing.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   Okay. And along with that, our second Peter Bible study is starting on August 31st.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.320]   And so if you have not signed up for that, please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:36.320]   And I know there's a handful of you who are planning to take it, but you haven't signed up.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   We need you to sign up as soon as possible today, if possible, because if you don't sign up on time,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   we are going to be putting people in the small group, so we won't be adding you to an existing small group.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   What's going to end up happening is everybody who came late are going to be in the same small group.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   Okay. And then, which means that you may be like all over the place,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   the different people that are coming in. And so we're not going to be able to purposely put you in a small group.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   We're just going to have to randomly whoever signs up late.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   So if you are planning to do it, please do it ASAP so that it will help us to organize these things better.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   Okay. I think that's it for the announcements.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   All right. So let me pray for us. And again, we have a physical offering box in the back.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   If you have a check or something physical that you need to drop off,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   it's right underneath that big clock as you are leaving.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   And for the rest of us, we'll give you a minute to give your offering electronically.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   All right. Let's pray.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for guiding us and leading us.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   Lord, we know that this is a tremendous privilege to be able to come before your throne,
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   to call you our Abba Fathers, to sing these praises.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   Lord, if we become so inoculated to worship Lord God,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   where it's more just habit than anything else,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   I pray that you would stir our hearts, Lord God, to lean toward you.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   We know, Father God, that this life is limited.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   That no matter how much our dreams may come true in this world,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   we know, Father God, that it's temporary.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   Help us to live with that in mind,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   that we may invest in eternal things, Lord God, not temporary things.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   I pray that you will keep us sober, to wake us up, Lord God,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320]   from the things that we've been entangled in,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.320]   that your word, your spirit, the songs, our fellowship, all of it, Lord God,
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   may point us to you and to realign our whole lives, Lord God, according to your word.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   May this offering that we give to you, may it also be an act of true worship that we give,
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   may it be multiplied for your use. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   Let us all rise as we sing these phrases.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   [Music]
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Great is your faithfulness.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Great is your faithfulness, O God.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   You wrestle with the sinner's heart.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   You lead us by still waters into mercy.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   And nothing can keep us apart.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   So remember your people.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   Remember your children.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   Remember your promise, O God.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   Your grace, your grace is enough.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   Great is your love and justice, God.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   [Music]
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   You use the weak to lead the strong.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   You lead us in the song of your salvation.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   And all your people sing along.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   So remember your people.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   Remember your children.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   Remember your promise, O God.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   Your grace, your grace is enough.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   So remember, so remember your people.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   Remember your children.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   Remember your promise, O God.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   Your grace is enough.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   Your grace, your grace is enough.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   Heaven reaching down to us.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   God, I see your grace is enough.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   I'm covered in your love.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.320]   Your grace is enough for me.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   For me.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   [Music]
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.320]   Amen. Ephesians 1-7 reads, "In him we have redemption through his blood,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   What peace and what joy to know that Jesus paid the debt of our sin,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   not just a portion, but all of it, so that we may stand fully forgiven and fully justified by his blood."
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   With that, let us sing this next song.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   [Music]
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   I hear the Savior say, I hear the Savior say,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Thy strength indeed is small. Child of weakness, watch and pray.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   Find in me thine all in all.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   [Music]
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   Lord now, Lord now, indeed I find,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   Thy power and thine alone can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   [Music]
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   And when before the throne, and when before the throne,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   I stand in incomplete, Jesus died my soul to save,
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   My lips shall still repeat, Jesus paid.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   Sin had left, sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   [Music]
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   Oh praise the one, oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   And raised this life up from the dead. Oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   And raised this life up from the dead. Oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   And raised this life up from the dead. Oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   And raised this life up from the dead. Oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   And raised this life up from the dead. Oh praise the one who paid my debt,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   And raised this life up from the dead.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   Sing Jesus paid it all.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   Sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white as snow.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 2,
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   I'm going to continue our series in the book of Luke.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   The text we're looking at is in verse 39 through 52,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   but for the sake of time, I will just read the first two verses.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   And again, I strongly encourage you when I put those questions
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   and the passage that we're looking at, because it's a narrative,
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   we're covering a larger portions that we would normally do in an epistle.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   And so try to read that, at least know what's going on in the context,
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   and you'll be able to get more out of the sermon that way.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   Okay, so I'm going to be reading verse 39 to 40.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   When they performed everything according to the law of the Lord,
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   they returned to Galilee to their own city of Nazareth.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   The child continued to grow and become strong and increasing in wisdom,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   and the grace of God was upon him. Let's pray.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   Heavenly Father, we come before you seeking to hear from you,
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:46.320]   wanting to know your heart, who you are, what you've done,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   that all of it would cause us to see a greater glimpse of your glory,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   that we would learn to love you, honor you with all that we have.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   I pray that you would give us soft hearts, that we may be molded easily by your word.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   Open the ears, Lord God, that we may be eager to hear.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   And a will, Father, that is willing to obey and to apply all that you teach us.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   So we pray for your grace and your Holy Spirit to work mightily this morning.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   You know, when we're young, we don't think too much about our parents' childhood.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   Maybe some of you guys don't know much about your parents,
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   your mother or father, and what they were like when they were children.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   You know, and a lot of times we don't even, we're not even curious until they're out of our lives.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   And then when we get older, we say, "Oh, I wonder what my dad was like when he was my age."
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Or, "I wonder what my mom was like when she was a teenager or, you know, in elementary school."
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   And again, I wasn't any different.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   You know, when I was young, of course, everything that I knew about him was my experience
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   of when I remember what he was like.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.320]   But it wasn't until after he passed, I was like, "Oh, I wonder what my dad was like when he was a kid."
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.320]   You know, or when he was a teenager.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   Well, the benefit that I have is my dad actually wrote a memoir and he wrote an autobiography.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   So I'm able to read through that.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   And so there's certain things about my dad that I find out now just from reading his autobiography.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   And one of the things that was interesting to me was that my dad said that when he was about 15 years old,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   he used to lift weights.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   And I was kind of surprised.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   I said, "Koreans had weights back then? You know, 1940s, 1950s?"
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   And so it was interesting because he was saying, you know, like at that time, nobody actually lifted weights.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   But, you know, he was explaining why he started lifting weights and all that.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   And then I was like, when I was younger, I felt this connection, kindred spirit with him
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   because I lifted weights when I was younger, right?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   In high school.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   And this is before all this, like, exercise craze.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   Right? Before, remember Jacqueline Lane?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   A few of you.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   Jacqueline Lane started this craze and then it evolved into what it is today.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   But anyway, so the more I'm learning about this, oh, there's a lot of things that I didn't know about my dad.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   And it kind of reveals a lot about who he was when I look at his childhood.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   I say all of this because when we think about Christ,
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   almost everything that we know about Jesus is after he starts his ministry at the age of 30.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   We know almost nothing about those 30 years.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   Right?
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.320]   Now, we know we've been studying about his birth and we know how his parents were,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   by the way that they were faithful to the law and did all of this stuff.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   But Jesus himself, we don't have much to go by.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   In fact, the only text that we have in the whole Bible that describes these 30 years after his birth narrative
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   is recorded in this text.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   The only statement that he makes in those 30 years is recorded in verse 49 where it says,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   "Why is it that you are looking for me? Did you not know that I had to be in my father's house?"
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   That's all we know.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   In 30 years, at the age of 12, he states that.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   In fact, he states that and he's turning the tables on his parents because his parents lost him.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   And they go back frantically, look for him and say, "Why did you do this to me, to us?"
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   And Jesus turns the table on him and, "Did you not know that I was supposed to be here?"
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   Right?
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   Again, I don't know if he said it in that tone,
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   but all we know is that that's the only statement that we have in those 30 years.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   And this narrative that we see here in verse 41 to 52 about him losing him, finding him at the temple,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   how he's asking questions, he's growing and maturing and that's all we know about his childhood.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   So, for sure, this is not written here randomly.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   This is the only statement given to us by Jesus.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   And if this is the only thing that is revealed to us about those 30 years, directly linked to him,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   clearly that's here for a reason.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.320]   So, this morning we want to comb through this and to try to glean as much as possible
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   because it does give us a glimpse into what Jesus was like as a child.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   It does give us a glimpse as to what it may have been like to raise the Son of God.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   And so, by doing so, it kind of connects us to Jesus' humanity in a way that I think we would,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   maybe we wouldn't have as rich of a knowledge of if we didn't understand what's going on.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   The beginning of this narrative starts in verse 40, basically by telling us,
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   "This child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   That basically covers 12 years of his life.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   He said he was continuing to grow, becoming strong, in wisdom, in the grace of God.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   And that summarizes everything that's been happening up to that point.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   And then at the end of the narrative, verse 52, it describes the next 18 years
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   before he shows up as a full-grown adult at age 30.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   It says, "And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men."
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   And so that's it. Those two phrases, that the beginning and the end, basically says similar things.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Growing in wisdom, in favor of God, in favor of men, and that's what was going on up to age 12,
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   and that's what's going on after the age of 12.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   And so this story basically is sandwiched by those two statements that he's growing,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   he's maturing, wisdom, favor, by the grace of God.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   Now, age 12 and age 30 is not by accident.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   I already explained why Jesus shows up at the age of 30, because in the Levitical teaching,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   it says that 30 is the age where they considered you have experienced fullness of life.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   Now, it doesn't mean that you experience everything that you could possibly experience as a human being.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   Jesus was not a father, he was never a mother, he was never a grandfather,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   so it doesn't mean that every possible experience you could experience as a human being, Jesus experienced.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   But 30 years was enough to be able to live a full adult life,
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   to say that now you can minister at the temple as an adult.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   Well, at the age of 12 was when they transitioned to adulthood.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   So Bar Mitzvah, as you guys know, is the Jewish community celebrates that as a transition into adulthood.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   They're not quite adults yet, but they're not children yet.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   So from age 12 to 13 is a transition that takes place.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   Now, the Bar Mitzvah was not introduced to the Jewish culture until after the time of Christ,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   but there was an understanding in the Jewish culture where the age 12 was the last year of your childhood.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   So the fact that age 12 is emphasized here is purposeful.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   It's not just random that we find story about what's going on at age 12,
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   because basically Luke is telling us that this is what was going on in his childhood up to 12,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   and then the next time we see him as a full-blown adult.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   Now, in this childhood and his growth to adulthood, to age 30, it says he grew.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   He grew. First thing that he says, he grew.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   Now, that may not seem strange to see because every child grows.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   But you have to understand we're talking about the Son of God.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   We're talking about God himself who created the universe.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   All things are created by him and for him, and to have him described as he grew.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   Was Adam created as an infant?
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   No. According to, we don't know what age he was, but he was created as a man
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   because when Eve was created, they were able to procreate.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   So Adam is not described as an infant. So he was created as a grown man.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   Again, we don't know exactly what age he would have been,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   but Jesus came to this earth from the very beginning,
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   experienced all that every human being could experience.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   It says he grew.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   Now, that may sound like a luck thing, but those of you who've experienced
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   bringing children home from the hospital, you know how vulnerable an infant is.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   I remember growing up, my dad would always say, "Peter, whatever you touch, you break."
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   And I didn't disagree with him because I remember as a child,
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.320]   I'd be in some sort of a band and I'm playing the castanets or something,
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.320]   and then at the end of the class, it's broken.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   And it wasn't like I was trying to break it, I was just curious how far this would bend.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   And I found out.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.320]   And so, yeah, I don't disagree with him. I'm curious.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.320]   So I just go, "I'm curious," I just kind of act.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   And so my dad would always say to me, "Whatever you touch, you break."
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   And obviously he said that out of frustration.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   But I remember when we were given Jeremy as an infant, our first child,
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   and after a couple days of resting, and they hand the baby over to us,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   and they said, "Now it's your responsibility."
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   And it was just ringing in my head, "Whatever you touch, you break."
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   [laughter]
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   I said, "These people are crazy. I don't know how to raise this kid."
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   And I remember early on how Esther would constantly be on the phone at the hospital.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.320]   "Is that normal?" He coughed. "Is that normal?" You know what I mean?
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   "How thick is the poo supposed to be? It seems kind of watery."
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   And I remember constantly calling.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   Because neither of us knew, and we didn't have adults around at that time,
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   so we just kind of had to figure it out.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   But if you've experienced raising an infant, you know how vulnerable they are.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   They literally will die.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   You don't have to do anything. Just out of neglect.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   That's how vulnerable they are.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   So it's strange to think that the Son of God experienced infancy.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   He was completely dependent upon somebody else, His own creation, to take care of Him.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   You know what it was like.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   Every infant has to learn how to talk, how to eat.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   Remember when you feed them, and they come out sucking milk,
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   and if the mother doesn't produce enough milk,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   and at least in our generation, we have alternatives.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   We have Similac and different things that you can feed.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.320]   But I wonder what they did a long time ago.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   And then when they are out of that stage, you start to introduce solace,
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   and then you have to make sure that all the bumps are grounded out,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   and everything is so that they don't choke on anything.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   And then the next stage, they learn how to crawl and then walk.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   You could tell when you walk in today, when you walk into a home,
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   if there's an infant or a young child in the home that's just starting to walk,
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   and their fingers are shaved off, or they got some rubber bumpers everywhere, right?
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   You got to make sure everything's tied down, so everything's safe.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   It has to be safe, at least in this generation.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.320]   You know how much work and time goes into raising a child,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   and how vulnerable they are every stage of their life.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   When the Bible says that Jesus grew,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   it means that He went through all that stage to grow, to mature.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   He was completely helpless, and these young children, Mary and Joseph,
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   like His physical life was dependent on their faithfulness to take care of these childs.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   So for any other child, you say, "Yeah, He grew."
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.320]   And we have measuring standards.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.320]   I think one of the most horrible things that they have done in modern medicine with children is,
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   they say, "Your child is 5%. Your child is 10% weight."
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   You know? I don't know why they don't do that with intelligence.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   [laughter]
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   You know, and then the parents come home, and it's like, "They're only 5% or 10% or 20%,"
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   and it makes you anxious, like, "Oh, they're behind, and you need to do this."
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.320]   It's hard enough to raise children, but now you have all these extra things that burden you.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   But we all know just how much time and effort it is because they're so vulnerable.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.320]   Jesus, when it says they grew, the Son of God,
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   experienced growth, helplessness, like anybody else.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   He says not only did He grow physically, He says He grew strong by increasing in wisdom.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   Now, when He says He grew, He grew strong. He's not talking about physical muscles.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   I often hear about people interpreting it and say, "Well, Jesus must have been so muscular."
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   See, it says He grew strong because He was a carpenter.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.320]   You know, so He must have had muscles.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   That's not what He's referring to. The "strong" here is actually in Greek attached to wisdom.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   So the way that we should understand it is He became strong by increasing in wisdom.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   So His strength was directly linked to Jesus growing in wisdom.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   Which is a really strange thing to say because we don't typically describe a 12-year-old as being wise.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:05.320]   Typically we think of wisdom as somebody who's kind of lived a long life, experienced the hardship,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   and went through some trials and difficulty, and He became wise because of that.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   But when a child at that age, we don't usually say "wise."
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   We usually describe them as being smart, maybe articulate, or maybe obedient, maybe clever.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:29.320]   But we don't attribute wisdom because the way we describe wisdom is somebody who experienced life.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   But you and I also know, we know plenty of people who experienced life a bunch of fools.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.320]   I don't have to mention anybody.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.320]   You guys can all think of, just because you're old doesn't mean you're wise.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   You know that.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   I know plenty of people who've gone through horrible things and difficult things,
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   and at the end of it, they're not any more wiser than they were when they started.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   So wisdom isn't automatically just because you got old.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   And obviously, specifically, that's not what it means here.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   So what does it mean to describe Jesus at 12 being wise?
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.320]   Growing in wisdom.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:21.320]   Well the word wisdom in the Greek dictionary says, "skill in the affairs of life, practical wisdom, wise management."
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   And the wisdom that is described in Jesus is, not only was he learning, but he was applying.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:32.320]   So his understanding of life and about the law did not come from book study.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   It wasn't just that he went there and he started growing understanding about the Bible,
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   and yet he didn't apply any of this stuff.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   You can study the Bible, know, experience life, and have all this knowledge crammed in your head,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   and you're living in compromise, self-centered, and you're no longer wise.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   You're no more wise than you when you first started.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:59.320]   The wisdom that the Bible talks about is directly linked to learning the Bible and applying the Bible.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   That's where wisdom comes.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   Wisdom is knowing what God had created, what he intended, and living your life in accordance to what God had intended.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.320]   You can study the Bible and become a PhD and still remain a fool.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   You can go to church all your life and become a leader and be a fool.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   You can have all the experiences. You could have gone to war and experienced hardship,
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   and at the end of it be a fool.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   Wisdom of Jesus is described, again, through Hebrews 5.8, it says,
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.320]   "Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things which he suffered."
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.320]   That's how he became wise. Not only did he learn the truth, he applied the truth.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   So having that as a background, right?
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   That 12 years, that this is what it was like. He was living an obedient life.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   He was studying. He was growing in knowledge, growing in application.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   That as a background, we go into verse 41-44, gives us the narrative.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   The only narrative of his childhood that gives us a glimpse of what it was like, maybe, for his humanity as a child.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   Verse 41-44 says, "Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover."
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   "When he became twelve, they went up there according to the custom of the feast."
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   "And as they were returning, after spending the full number of days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents were unaware."
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   "But suppose it, him to be in the caravan and went a day's journey, and they began looking for him among their relatives and acquaintances."
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:39.320]   So first thing that I want to highlight here, is that just like we looked at last week's passage,
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   where the parents are obedient, they lived according to the law, and it reveals to us that his parents were very faithful Jews.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   That they raised him in a godly home.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   See, in the Jewish tradition, there's three specific festivals that was commanded for the Jewish men to come and attend in Jerusalem and go to the temple and celebrate.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.320]   Those three festivals were the Passover, Pentecost, and the Tabernacle.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   But because of the diaspora, because of them being carried along to Syria, to Persia, to Babylonia, they were all spread out all over the world.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   They couldn't make that journey all three times.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   So, faithful Jews, not all Jews, but faithful Jews chose the Passover to be the day where they would make this travel.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   According to this passage, it says that they did this every single year.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   And they stayed the full amount.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.320]   The Passover, although it's only one day, the Feast of Puth would come right after that.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   So if they stayed for the whole thing, they would be staying somewhere around seven to eight days.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   It's a five day journey to get there, five day journey to go back, which means about 17, 20 days out of the year,
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:56.320]   they would pack up their bags and come to Jerusalem to celebrate this festival.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   And they did this every single year.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:07.320]   And at this time, the majority of the Jews did not practice this because it was too hard to pack up their bags and make this journey every single year.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   So one, it tells us that Jesus was raised in a very godly home who obeyed the commandments, all of it.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   But it also reveals about Mary, because the commandment to make this journey was only commanded to men.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   So the fact that Mary and all the children packed up their bags and they went together tells us something about Mary's faith.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.320]   She was also faithful.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   So in other words, it's telling us that Jesus was raised in a very godly home with good examples of following the law.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Now, we talked about last week why this is being emphasized for us.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:43.320]   Because in every way, Jesus was obedient to the law, even as an infant.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.320]   So it's in this context that we are told that Jesus gets lost.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   Right? Verse 33, 43b.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:54:07.320]   You know what's really important, interesting here?
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:13.320]   He said, it describes Jesus for the first time and the last time as what?
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   A boy. Right?
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   Typically when we think of Jesus, we think of as an infant where his parents and all the things that are surrounding him.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   And then he shows up at the age of 30.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   As a full grown man, we know what he's saying, we know his personality, we know how he interacted with people.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   But here and only here, it says the boy Jesus.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   Now he's 12 years old.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   Now I already told you why the age 12 is significant.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   It's because in the Jewish culture, that's when they transition at the age of 13 to prepare for adulthood.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   They were no longer children, but they're seen as adolescents preparing for full adulthood.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.320]   For the next 18 years.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   We may just kind of skim over this, oh he was a boy, and this happened when he was a boy.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:03.320]   The Bible says that Jesus experienced temptation in every way and yet without sin.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   Those of you who've raised teenagers, right?
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   And right around that age 12 is when testosterone kicks in.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   And all of a sudden, it's like a different human being walking down.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   Right? They went up as a child and all of a sudden, just instantaneously, they walked down, their voice changed.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:32.320]   Right? And possibly, and again, I don't want to get in trouble, but you know when Jesus says in verse 49,
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   "Why is it that you were looking for me? Did you not know that I had to be in my father's house?"
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   That maybe Jesus said, "Why is it that you were looking for me?"
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   And did you not know that I had my father's house?
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   Because that's when that happens, at age 12. Right?
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   He's presented to us as a boy.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   Remember what happens at age 12?
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   Okay? Especially for the boys. Right?
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   If there's any period of time that you would like to just black out, my guess is somewhere around age 12 to maybe 14.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   Right? It's a blur. Like you're an adult, but you're not an adult.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   Right? You're thinking, but you're not thinking.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   Right? You know what you don't know.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:24.320]   It's a very strange period between that stage where you're transitioning into an adult,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   and obviously, we can say that age 12 back then is more mature than maybe age 12 today.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   12 is a significant number because that's where they're transitioning.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   When does that happen today in our culture?
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   I mean, legally it happens when you're 18, right?
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   You're 18, you can be independent, you can, you know, there's more things you can do.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   Or maybe 21, right, is when the transition happens.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   In reality, that's very relative. Right?
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.320]   If you ask the girls when that happens to the men, they say maybe 30. Right?
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   Maybe some of you wives are waiting for that to happen. Right?
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   It's relative. It depends on who you ask.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   But at least on paper, it's supposed to happen, right, at least in our culture, 17 to 18.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   Well, that's the age of 12 for Jesus.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   But why I want to highlight this is because we typically think of Jesus as a perfect human being,
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   and we see glimpses of His suffering and His humanity.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   But there's no period when we see the weakness of humanity, the frailty,
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   than when they were infants, and then when they were children, because that's when, you know, like,
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:43.320]   sin, I mean, we're all born with original sin, but where sin really just kind of comes alive, it feels like,
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.320]   is around that age.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   The Bible says that He was tempted in every way, yet without sin.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Think about what was happening at age 12.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.320]   Your body changing and all that. Right?
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   Age 12 is for boys in particular. Maybe some of you happened earlier, maybe some of you happened later,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   but up until that age, like, you're not aware.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   You know, it's like your whole world is like centered around your parents,
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   until all of a sudden they wake up, and then they're more concerned about what their friends think. Right?
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   So up until the age 12, you may go to sleep with your hair, you know, pushed back on one side,
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   and you just come out like that, because you don't care at that age.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   And all of a sudden, they hit puberty, their voice changed, and then they start doing their hair,
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   you know, and they got to wear certain pants, or their shoe has to match their socks,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   and the socks has to match their sweater, whatever.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   It happens during that period. Right?
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   So all of a sudden, the whole world opens up, and then you start to want to be independent of your parents.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.320]   And another thing that happens during that period, outside of wanting independence,
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   girls become girls during that age. Right?
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.320]   Don't act like you forgot.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.320]   That's when it happens.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.320]   You know, I want to be careful here.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.320]   But it's not sinful.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   I mean, you think about, because we think of Jesus as the Son of God, primarily.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.320]   But we think of Jesus and his humanity, right?
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   And he experienced what every human being experiences, yet without sin.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   So a lot of times you hear stories about how Jesus, you know, if he made a cabinet,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.320]   there was never anything that was ever wrong.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   So you think of as a Son of God, he got up and he ate everything that he wanted to eat,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   never had diarrhea, you know what I mean?
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.320]   Never had to worry about him because he was a perfect Son of God.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   But the Bible doesn't describe him that way in his childhood and growing up,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   and until he dies and resurrects.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   He's perfectly human.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.320]   That's why when Jesus is at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.320]   in his humanity, he was praying and wrestling
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   because he saw the pain that was coming in his humanity.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   It makes no sense as a Son of God why he would plead with God, his Father,
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   even though he volunteered to come.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   He willed himself to come.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.320]   He says, "Nobody takes my diet. I lay it down by my own accord,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   and I take it up by my own accord."
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.320]   And why the Son of God who did that would be crying before God?
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   It is in his full humanity.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   You know, I think at the beginning of this year,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   I gave an illustration about his hypostatic union of his humanness,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.320]   human nature, and his glory.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   You said, remember when I showed you an illustration about the water and the oil?
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   If you look in the cup, the water and oil is still distinct.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   They don't mix.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   And you look at the cup and you say, "That's Jesus.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   He's fully man and fully God."
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   So in Philippians 2, when he says,
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   "Even though in every way he was God, he emptied himself and he became nothing,"
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   it's a description of Jesus' hypostatic union,
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   where he was still God, but during his humanity, he veiled himself.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.320]   He did not tap into his omniscience or his power.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   All that he did, he did in his frail nature.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   And that's why Jesus is saying to his disciples when he's about to go,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320]   he says, "It's better for you if I go, because when the Holy Spirit comes,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   you will do greater things than I did,
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   which would make no sense as a son of God."
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   How can creation do greater things than what the Son of God did?
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.320]   He's referring to the miracles and everything that he did in his humanity.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   And so when the Holy Spirit comes, that you will do even greater than that.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.320]   So Jesus grew in wisdom.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.320]   He grew. And the Scripture tells us that he disappeared as a boy.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   He learned obedience.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.320]   And then we can look at that and say, "Well, why did it take them so long?"
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.320]   Right? Why did it take them a whole day to find Jesus?
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   Right? Are they just parents who just, you know, weren't paying attention?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   Right? Now, first of all, he's 12 years old.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   So my guess is they were coming back from the trip and, you know,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   the Scripture tells us that Jesus had at least four other brothers.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   They're mentioned in Matthew 23.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   That's only the boys.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.320]   So if there's other girls involved in there,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.320]   so my guess is that him being the oldest and he's 12,
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.320]   they probably had little ones running around and maybe even infants that they had to hold.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   So by the age of 12, you know, you're able to go. Right?
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   And him being an obedient son, my guess is they didn't worry about him. Right?
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   Because he was obedient. That's who he was. That's how he acted.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.320]   Right?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   Now, I remember when I was younger, you know, I didn't have that same privilege.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.320]   Because I was not a good kid.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   You know, I used to get into so many fights that I remember one time I came home and I got suspended.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   And I was sitting home in the middle of the day and my dad was going to come by
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   and I thought I was going to get into trouble.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   And my dad opened the door, he walked in, saw me sitting in the middle of the day.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.320]   I shouldn't have been there.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   And I remember I was just bracing myself.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.320]   Oh shoot, I'm going to get into trouble. And he looked at me and he said, "Who won?"
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   And, you know, I was kind of surprised, taking it back.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   He's like, "Who won?" And I just kind of sheepishly, I said, "I did."
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.320]   And then he just turned his head and walked upstairs.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   And I remember at that time thinking, "Wow, my dad's awesome."
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   You know, I didn't get into any trouble.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   But now looking back at it, I realize how exhausted he must have been.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   Like constantly fighting with me.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   And so when he saw me at home, it wasn't because he was like, "Oh, I'm going to show him some grace."
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   It was just, he was just, "Ugh, again."
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   Right? And so when he said, "Who won?"
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.320]   It was just, I think he just didn't know what to say.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   "Again?"
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   You know?
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   Jesus did not have that problem.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   So my guess is that because he was an obedient son, he was the obedient first son,
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   and they had to take care of their own kids, that they just assumed that he was going to be there.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   And so after a day's journey, they recognized because it was time for him to come home.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   And he always comes home. No matter where he is.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   Maybe he's going out playing with his friends or whatever he's doing.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   At the end of the day, he would come home and sleep at the tent with them.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.320]   So that's why I think it took all day for them to realize that Jesus is not here.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   And once they realized that, they pack up their bags and they got to go back and find him.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.320]   Even though he's 12, he's still a child.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.320]   And it says that it's three days it took them.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   So we don't know if it's counting one day there, one day back, and one day to look for him.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Or whether it was one day there, one day back, and it took them three days.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   So whether he was gone for three days or whether he was gone for five days,
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   can you imagine the frantic nature of this encounter?
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   Again, I remember early on at our church, when our church was much smaller.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.320]   And some of you guys, I don't even remember who you were.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   But we were meeting at Northwood Park, and it was maybe about 70, 80 at that time in our church.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   And we came after service and our children were missing.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.320]   This was about 14, 13 years ago.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   And I think Jeremy was maybe about six or seven, and Zachary was five or four.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   What's my math? Four.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.320]   And Faith was two, and this was before we had Isaiah.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   And all our kids were missing.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   And so obviously, you know, we're at a park with a bunch of strangers walking around.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   And so I remember Esther and I frantically looking for our kids for about 40 minutes, and we couldn't find them.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   And so we're freaking out. We're about to call the police.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   And we're like, "What the heck? What's going on?"
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   And then all of a sudden, we see our church people driving back, and the door's opening,
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   and our kids are just jumping out of the car with Jamba Juice in their hand.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   So the college student at that time just had a bright idea, saying they wanted Jamba Juice.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   And I said, "Just get on!"
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   With no car seats, nothing. They just jumped on, disappeared, went to get Jamba Juice, and showed up at church like nothing happened.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   So obviously, we were like, "Oh my." We were relieved, but at the same time, it's like, "Oh my gosh."
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   So we actually had to have a church meeting.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   [laughter]
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   It's like, "I know you guys are not used to taking care of kids, and you don't know what it's like,
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   but you cannot take two-year-olds and four-year-olds and seven-year-olds in your car and disappear from the parents for an hour."
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   Right? And they're like, "Oh, okay."
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.320]   They had no clue.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.320]   I mean, some of you guys, you know, who have young children like that, you can imagine how,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   what we felt like for that 40 minutes when we were looking for our kids.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   Now, Jesus is 12 years old, right?
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.320]   He's not an infant, but remember, they're five days' journey away. He's still a child.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.320]   And they're in Jerusalem. This is not a familiar place for them.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.320]   And the whole reason why they travel in caravan is for their own safety.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   So they don't know if they lost Him during the caravan.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   They don't know if somebody came in, He dropped, He fell where He is.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   So can you imagine how they must have felt?
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   And so when they finally meet Him, in Luke 2, verse 48, it says,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.320]   "When they saw Him, they were astonished. And His mother said to Him, 'Son, why have you treated us this way?
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.320]   Behold, your father and I have been anxiously looking for you.'"
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   So again, it's an understatement to lose your child for three months,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:49.320]   five days' journey away from home with bandits that are constantly trying to attack you.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.320]   And then they find Him. It's like, "Son, why have you treated us this way?"
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   And they were anxious. And they were anxious for a reason,
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.320]   because Jesus has never done anything like this before.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.320]   He was completely obedient.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   So all of a sudden, why would you do this?
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   So again, it gives us a glimpse of what that relationship must have been like.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.320]   Even though He was a Son of God, it's like, why would you do this?
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   And then Luke 2, verse 49 says, "And He said to them, 'Why is it that you were looking for Me?
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.320]   Did you not know that I had to be in My Father's house?'"
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:25.320]   What this tells me is that Jesus' childhood was like any other child.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Even though the prophecy was given, even though it was an immaculate conception,
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.320]   that in the period of raising Him, they raised Him like any other child.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.320]   Almost to the point where they forgot.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   It's like when Jesus says this, it's like they didn't understand.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   Mary treasured it in her heart, but she didn't fully understand.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Because this is a child that she fed.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   He had to wipe his butt, help him to walk.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   So like every parent, you remember when you raise your children,
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.320]   and they go to school, and they're attached to you when they're young,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.320]   and all of a sudden you've got to send them off to school for the first time?
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.320]   And then how, remember how anxious you felt when the kids were going?
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.320]   And just watching them, and eagerly waiting for the school to finish,
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   to ask them how it was?
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.320]   Do you remember that?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   Do you remember how anxious you felt?
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   Remember when they first got their license?
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   You know, you guys probably, you're going to say,
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.320]   "Oh man, I'm so eager to get my license."
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   And you're in your car, just ready to take off, to enjoy freedom for the first time.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   I guarantee you, your parents are at home praying for you.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   You're going out, and it's like, "Man, if he is as reckless as he is at home,
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.320]   what if he does that when he's out on the street, or when she's out on the street?"
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   I guarantee you, your parents were not eager. They had to.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   You know, they're frantic about giving you control,
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:56.320]   hoping and praying that you'll be able to handle this.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   You know where I see the most where this kind of comes to heads,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320]   is at the weddings.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   It doesn't matter if you're 23 or you're 33.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   You know, where this comes is like, you're eager to get married and become independent,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   start a new life, and you know, with my best friend.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   And all of a sudden, your parents start to put their hand in.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   And they start to, you know, squeeze a little bit,
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   and want a little bit more control.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   It's like, "Oh, why are my parents doing this? They were perfectly fine."
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   Because that's where you're eager to kind of go,
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   and your parents are finally holding on,
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   just the last bit of influence that they want to have on you.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   And so it's much more difficult for parents to let you go.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   Because they raised you.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   Because they took care of you.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   When you couldn't eat, they had to feed you.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.320]   When you were sick, they were the ones there.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.320]   When you had diarrhea, they're the ones who cleaned all of that.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   So to pour that much care and concern and prayer and anxiousness over a child,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   and then to all of a sudden just kind of let them go, that's not easy.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   That's why I always try to encourage the people,
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   young people who are getting married, is like, "Yeah, you know, maybe it's not fair,
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   and maybe they're tightening grip or whatever."
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.320]   It's just, you'll experience one day when you raise children,
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   how difficult it is to let you go.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   When Jesus says to his parents, "Why is it that you were looking for me?
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Did you not know that I had to be in my father's house?"
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   It wasn't simply a rebuke.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   It was time for them to recognize why he came.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   To release them.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.320]   Now, he's not going to be completely independent yet.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   In fact, most scholars believe that Joseph, his father, passed away soon after this encounter.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   There's no record of his father in church history,
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   of him being around anywhere after this infinite.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   This is the first time and last time we hear of Joseph.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.320]   So most people believe that Joseph probably lost his father,
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   which many people did at that time, and he had to grow up quick.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   So he became the father figure to all of his siblings early on.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   But when Joseph says to his parents, "Did you not know?"
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   In essence, he was telling his parents, "You need to let go.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   You need to let go."
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   Now, why is this so significant to all of us?
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   You know what's interesting is after all of this, in verse 51,
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   it describes the next 18 years of his life the same way that it's described the first 12 years.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   It says, "And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men."
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.320]   But then along with that, in verse 51, it says, "And he went down with them and came to Nazareth,
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.320]   and he continued in subjection to them."
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.320]   He continued in subjection to them.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   Even though he's the Son of God, he came.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   He created them. Everything was created by him and for him,
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320]   but he submitted himself to them.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.320]   He submitted himself to the teachers of Israel, asking them questions,
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   and they were surprised about how he was learning.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320]   But he did all of that.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   He did all of that to prepare himself for the cross.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   Every single one of us, we learn to be disciplined for the next stage.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   If you're students, you wake up early, take your units and turn papers and cram for your studies.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   Why do you do all that? Is it because you, "Man, I just love knowledge."
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   Maybe. Maybe some of you guys are weird.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   But the rest of humanity, you do it because if you do that, you get the grades, you graduate,
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   and then you get a good job.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   You start Monday through Friday, so you can get good money, get promoted,
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   save that money so that you can buy a house or take a trip.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.320]   So everything that we do, we sacrifice because we think there's a greater payoff by these sacrifices.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   Jesus lived his whole life sacrificing to prepare him for the cross.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   This is not here randomly.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.320]   Every little thing that he did in subjection,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   learning from the scribes who later on he describes that these are people who,
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   you know, you need to obey them because they put themselves in the seat of Moses,
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   but don't do what they do.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   They're hypocrites.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   He submitted himself even to those people.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   Why did he do that? Why is that highlighted?
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.320]   Every single thing that he did from the moment he was born until the day he died
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.320]   was to prepare himself to be the perfect sacrifice without defect.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   He's the only human being who was specifically born to die.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   Every one of us.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.320]   This is not a random story in the Bible.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.320]   This is not just some interesting facts about his childhood.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   If you believe this and you accept this,
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.320]   how does this not change us?
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   You know, we love our parents,
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   even the ones that we are mad at.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   Because they sacrificed for us, maybe not perfectly.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   We can't help appreciate them.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   We can't help be loyal to them.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   We can't help but love them because we are recipients of the love that they gave us.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   Not perfectly, but because they raised us.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   They sacrificed for us.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   Every willful thing that Jesus did and continues to do was for us.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:55.320]   So when we believe that, we love because he first loved us.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   So I pray that even this story is a reminder to us that God declares with all his might,
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   "I love you."
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320]   Let's pray.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   Gracious Father, we pray that your word would continue to impact us.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.320]   And when we understand the depth of your sacrifice,
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.320]   what Christ suffered and endured on our behalf,
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   not simply so that he can be sympathetic toward us,
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   but that he would know how to guide us and lead us and help us in times of need.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   I pray, Father God, that as we continue to study his humanity,
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   his suffering, loneliness, rejection, humiliation, betrayal,
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   his hungering, thirsting, the pain,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   help us, Lord God, to see him as a human being,
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.320]   not just a figurehead.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.320]   That our love for him would not just be theory, but reality.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   We love you, Lord.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.320]   We thank you.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   [Piano music]
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.320]   All I once, all I once held dear
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   built my life upon
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:47.320]   all this world, rivers and wars to own
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.320]   all I once thought gained
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:59.320]   I have counted, lost, spent and worthless now
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.320]   compared to this
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   knowing you, Jesus
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   knowing you, there is no greater thing
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   you're my all, you're the best
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.320]   you're my joy, my righteousness
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:34.320]   and I love you, Lord
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   [Piano music]
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:48.320]   Now my heart's, now my heart's desire
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   is to know you more
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   to be found in you
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.320]   and known as yours
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.320]   possessed by faith
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   what I could not earn
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   all surpassing good
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   of righteousness
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:23.320]   knowing you, Jesus
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:33.320]   knowing you, there is no greater thing
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.320]   you're my all, you're the best
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   you're my joy, my righteousness
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   and I love you, Lord
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:57.320]   Oh to know, oh to know the power of your risen life
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   and to know you in your suffering
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   to become like you in your death, my Lord
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   with you to live and never die
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   knowing you, Jesus
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   knowing you, there is no greater thing
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   you're my all, you're the best
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   you're my joy, my righteousness
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   you're my all, you're the best
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   you're my joy, my righteousness
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.320]   and I love you, Lord
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.320]   [Piano music]
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320]   That's great.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   and eternal love of God the Father
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   rest, strengthen, uphold, build, rebuke
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.320]   and guide us and sanctify us
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.320]   wherever it is that the Spirit of God sends
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320]   [Piano music]
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   God sent his Son
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   they called him Jesus
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.320]   he came to love
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.320]   heal and forgive
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   he lived and died
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   to buy my pardon
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   an empty grave is there to prove
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.320]   my Savior lives
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.320]   because he lives
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.320]   I can face tomorrow
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   because he lives
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   all fear is gone
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   because I know

[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.320]   and life is worth the living
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   just because he lives
