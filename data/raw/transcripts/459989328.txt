[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Good morning, church family.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.240]   My name is Nicholas Nguyen, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.020]   So coming from a loving, non-Christian family, religion was a very small aspect of my life
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.480]   from an early age.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.920]   The first time I attended church was when I was 13 years old.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.120]   At that point, I was curious about the faith, but I was far from being saved.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.720]   I did not understand how Christ dying on the cross was an act of love, but I knew that
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.640]   He was the way to heaven.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.620]   And since I just wanted to fit into the church setting, I would pray thanking God for saving
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.000]   us from something I could not understandâ€”sin.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.560]   However, seeing how some of my peers who called themselves Christians performed questionable
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.520]   actions, I thought that as long as I was a good person, I would go to heaven.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.640]   With this shallow understanding and a hardened heart, it did not take much for me to stop
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.560]   going to church.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.400]   Entering college, I had no thought of joining a college ministry on campus or attending
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400]   a church again.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.600]   Through my experiences, I never understood the importance of attending church if people
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200]   were just going to act the same as good people in the world.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920]   In a sense, I thought of myself as flawless and self-righteous.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.800]   I would constantly judge others to boost my own confidence, and I thought that I was heaven-bound
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.960]   because I was not a particularly bad person.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.560]   With my ignorance towards sin and my earthly ambitions, I never thought much about my spiritual
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   well-being.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.120]   However, even through my arrogance, God still brought me to a college ministry with my cousin.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   When I went to the meeting, I was met by a group of very welcoming people.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   That night, the thing that surprised me was how everyone pointed everything back to God.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.760]   Seeing such a faithful community, it made me question why they were so intentional.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.000]   Through my curiosity, I started attending Breen Community Church.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.640]   The first sermon I heard was about the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.360]   24 to 30.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.160]   This parable challenged me to think about the life of a Christian and the difference
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.080]   between a believer and a non-believer.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.600]   After hearing more messages, one message about compassion and selflessness caused me to examine
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   myself.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.120]   Before, I thought of myself as a pretty selfless person.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.360]   I always wanted to help others when they were in a bad spot and would always make time whenever
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   someone needed me.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.240]   But in the realization that I was just doing all this to gain recognition and self-glorification,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.680]   I understood my own sin and saw my own brokenness.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.760]   Before, through my own standards, I thought that I could judge if a person was good or
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   bad, which was why there was a contradiction between God's love and justice in my head.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.720]   But when I realized that even myself, whom I thought was righteous and was broken like
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   the rest of the world, I was able to understand the need for a Savior, the need for Jesus
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.760]   Christ.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.400]   One of my favorite passages in the Bible is Ephesians 2, 4-6, which says, "But God, being
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.040]   rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.240]   in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.400]   By grace, you have been saved and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.520]   heavenly places in Jesus Christ."
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.880]   Even though each and every one of us deserves eternal death, God's love pardoned us.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.440]   Through God's grace, I was able to receive Christ into my life.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.240]   I felt a deep joy knowing that my debt from sin was paid.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.320]   After being saved, I continue to see my own need for a Savior.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.240]   My struggle with my own pride and lust continues to be present.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.320]   However, knowing that God has released me from the bonds of sin and loves me, a sinful
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.240]   and broken person, I am able to find comfort and peace in Christ.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   Thank you.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   [applause]
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:04:02.920]   >> All right.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.480]   Nicholas you understand when you go into the water, you're being united with Christ and
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.520]   his death, and when you come out, you're being united with his resurrected life?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   >> I do.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.440]   >> Then I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   [applause]
