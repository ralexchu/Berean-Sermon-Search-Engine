[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   While the Koreans face their internal obstacles to win and win externally, the next heat will begin soon.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Competitors are stretching and coming out and getting ready.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Meanwhile, the cabbage is savage to coach D'Antonio to try some of their secret drink.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Hey, Mike and Dwight from Spantonia, do you want to try some Juicing?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Everyone is Juicing. Some people are born with more Juicing than others.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It's the only way you can be strong like us.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Yeah, we are so full of Juicing. We are so strong.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Yeah, don't you want to be strong like us?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Of course.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Question, how much does this Juicing cost?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   For you, $10.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Only $10? Let's just say it's a steal.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Actually, just for you guys, the first one we'll give it to you for free.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   We gotta go. The race is about to start. What do we do?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Mike, nothing is for free.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Shh, stop talking. Just give me the Juicing. I want to win. Give it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Okay, as we start and get ready for the next event, we are going to need the children to get off of aisles 3, 4, and 5 for the next event.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So if you are sitting in 3, 4, and 5, Scantronians took the Juicing.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And now, they are going to prepare for the relay race.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We have Boreans on aisle 3.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We have the Scantronians on 5.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And we have the Koalans on 4.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Okay, we will now begin the relay race in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, beep.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Okay, we have Scantronians in first place. Now it's the Koalans. And last we have the Boreans.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   How will this race end up?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   There goes the Scantronians. Wait, where's Boreans? Boreans lost. Uh oh.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We have the Koalans on first, Scantronians on second, Boreans on third. How is this going to end up? We'll never know. Until now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Oh, we have Scantronians on first, Koalans on second, and Boreans on third.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So now that we know the place, let's see what's happening.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Thanks Koalans, your Juicing gave us extra power.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, thanks. It gave me extra power to beat them. Beats.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, no problem.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Hey, what are you guys talking about?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We're just talking about how they got second because they drank our juice. Our juice beat your guy.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's not very nice.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Hey, you know what, QE? Stop being such a cutie. This is only for winners, okay?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Question, why don't you try some of this juice too? You don't want to end up with a friend, do you?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Isn't that against the rules?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Hey, who cares? Don't you want to be winners like us?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Even though we were born with sin, doesn't mean we need to be more sin. We don't need this Juicing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Anna Banana, please don't listen to them. God sent Jesus to us for a reason.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Our lives are full of Juicing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Juicing!
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We are so strong.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Juicing!
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We are so strong!
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Only the winners on stage. Why don't you go to the front and ask your God for help.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Let's go, boys. You want to count?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   How do I know if I can trust you guys? Do you believe in God?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I'm not superstitious. I'm a little superstitious. So, no.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Did I stutter? I'll leave you with this juice, okay?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You and your God.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You don't want to lose, do you?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   What do I do? I'm losing this race right now. But I really, really want to win.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So, let's test this juice.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Juicing!
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   This is so tough.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Anna Banana, we can't get rid of our own sin. This Juicing can't get rid of us, either. Only God can.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Hey, Anna.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Strong! Faster!
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Strong!
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We are the champions!
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We are the champions!
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We are the champions!
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Raise up and trot!
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Faster!
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   With the skin of the winner on my shoulder
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   With the salt of my sweat on my brow
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And all in the night
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And you hear your people cry
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   "Let us not destroy the world"
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Deliver us, deliver all, deliver us
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   For the Lord will never rust
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   In His perfect hand
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Deliver us, there's a man in the promised land
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Deliver us, we will follow His plan
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Kids, who or what should Anna Banana put her faith to? Juice or God?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yell it out! What should she put her faith in?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Anna, now I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to trust you.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And that's what Anna Banana decided to do.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   If you didn't hear her, you have to wait until tomorrow to find out.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   For the final race, will Anna Banana choose the secret power of Juice or God?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   In John 1.29b, look.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Find out tomorrow on Korean Olympics!
