[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   OK, then we're going to jump into this.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.140]   If you look at the end of the class number one, the lecture,
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.140]   you're going to see at the very end of each lecture
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.780]   a place where all the homework is listed out.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.900]   So that should be comprehensive at the end of each lecture.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.820]   But beyond that, when you come in every week,
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.460]   you are going to have a short five-minute quiz as well.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.940]   And the purpose of the quiz is just for accountability's sake.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.220]   So have fun with it.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.860]   We're going to take the quizzes.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.020]   We are going to switch papers and grade each other
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.220]   and have that extra form of accountability of shame.
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.980]   That's all going to be there.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.060]   But all in all, the quizzes are going
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.980]   to be based on homework and lecture.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.820]   And it's going to be big.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.740]   It's going to be big category headings and things like that.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.220]   So you don't have to study an hour for it.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.780]   If you're doing that, you're probably
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.100]   studying a little bit too much.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.020]   But you want to get the general principles that
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.100]   are flowing out of all of the things.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.860]   I did an evaluation thing with the previous class.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.500]   And they told me which ones were headings.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.000]   Sure.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.980]   Can always be close.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.900]   So-- and the memory verses are pretty short.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900]   I know a lot of you are memorizing through books
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.020]   right now, the Bible.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.020]   And so it might feel like a lot.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.180]   But it is required.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.060]   The memory verses are going to be required.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.380]   Because when you're evangelizing,
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.020]   if you're not using scripture, not
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.180]   that you should feel any less about it,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.620]   but it enhances your ability to evangelize a lot.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.020]   When you have scripture at the tip of your tongue,
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.020]   and you see--
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.220]   even for yourself, even if you don't say it, the verse,
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.260]   even for yourself to understand that the authority
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.640]   of scripture is backing you rather
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.620]   than Christian principles, it's very important.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.300]   So please do memorize those.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.020]   OK.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.260]   So before we get into class one, are there
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   any basic logistical questions?
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.740]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.740]   Everyone's good?
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740]   [LAUGHS]
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.660]   I feel like we need to do an icebreaker,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.740]   but we don't have time to.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.340]   It's kind of frigid in here.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.900]   There's 15-- wait, 15?
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.540]   Yeah, we have 15 married people in here, seven college students
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.380]   and seven bammers.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.300]   That's kind of the breakdown of our class here.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.820]   So get to know each other, I guess.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.140]   After class ends, you guys can kind of talk to each other
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.620]   or whatever.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.580]   So yeah, I'm excited for this.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.860]   If there are no other questions, we'll begin.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:05.020]   Is the store still open?
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.500]   Hello.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hi.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.780]   Oh, Christine, you want to grab this one?
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.840]   OK.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.280]   [PAPER RUSTLING]
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.520]   All right, so lesson number one, there's
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   going to be six lessons total.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.200]   The middle four is just simple gospel.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.680]   Hi.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.180]   Hey, guys.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.960]   OK, cool.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.320]   The simple gospel presentation.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.080]   And then the first one is going to be on the motivation
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.600]   behind it.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   And then the last lesson is going to be on methodologies.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.080]   Probably around week four or five,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.540]   we're going to start doing a little bit of role play, too,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.200]   kind of pairing off and having you guys evangelize
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   to each other.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.400]   And you're going to be taking on a different religion.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.720]   So the one that's being evangelized to is going--
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.120]   so we're going to be kind of doing
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.720]   all these little things in between.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.240]   So no, there's going to be some interaction.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.660]   But this one is going to be purely,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.640]   I'm going to be talking at you today.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.600]   So this is the motivation for evangelism.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.200]   So if you look at that introduction,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.280]   what are your personal feelings about evangelism,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.800]   please check any that apply to you.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   Can you go ahead and do that in the next 30 seconds?
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:25.640]   This is just for you.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   You're not going to be sharing this or anything.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   Sometimes being aware of this, of something you checked off,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.280]   is helpful.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.960]   Just being aware that, man, I'm pretty timid.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.240]   You know that about yourself, but just be aware of it.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   Bring it into awareness.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.840]   And then you can use that to say, how can I attack that?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.320]   As we go out evangelizing together,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.520]   I hope that we can do this.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.400]   So our mission, God's purpose.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.040]   My first quote here is, "Evangelism
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.840]   is to Christianity what veins are to our bodies.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.440]   You can cut Christianity anywhere,
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.120]   and it will bleed evangelism.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.680]   Evangelism is vascular.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   It's our business.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   Talk about majoring on evangelism,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.560]   you might as well talk about a doctor majoring on healing.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.080]   That's our business."
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.000]   Man by the name of Bass Harner at the Moody Bible Institute.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.560]   So these are a couple of the questions
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.840]   that we're going to be tackling.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   How do we gain motivation to evangelize?
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.120]   And secondly, how should we motivate others to evangelize?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.440]   Now, the motivation behind evangelism
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.000]   has to be step one here.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.240]   It has to be.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.120]   Because we know that we ought to be evangelizing,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.360]   and your answer can be quite different from everybody else
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.640]   in this room too.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.280]   But our motivation has to be on the same heartbeat here,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.920]   on the same track.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.160]   So going into some of the false motivations here,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.840]   there are temporary manipulations.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.800]   So the first one is a sob story.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.440]   A dying friend in your arms, if you only had one more minute
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.480]   to share the gospel.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.600]   So that can feel like a motivation.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.120]   And many of us maybe have felt that with a family
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.760]   member who's in the hospital.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.560]   And that motivation has a good end to it,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.520]   but it could have a wrong beginning to it.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.040]   Because this person is dying, and if you
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.080]   are so just taken captive by that thought, he's dying,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.520]   he needs to hear the gospel.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.360]   That sounds really good.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.800]   But that can't be the beginning motivation.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.360]   It is always, and we're going to see,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.440]   it is always going to be a desire for God, his glory,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.560]   his kingdom, his renown, his fame.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.440]   It's always going to be that.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.400]   And so while these things are very important,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.840]   like he's dying, that has to fall
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.080]   under the category of who God is and why it's so important
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.040]   that we're preaching him.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   So we're going to try to do that.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.920]   The second one, cancer story.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.080]   You have the cure to cancer, and you've withheld it.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.160]   You're a terrible person.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.520]   And so you've heard that before maybe in your life, right?
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.480]   We're Christians.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.840]   We have the cure to cancer.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.160]   How dare you?
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.520]   How dare you hold that to yourself?
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.840]   That's a wrong motivation.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.000]   There's truth behind it, of course.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.880]   We ought to be asking ourselves, how can we
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.760]   be so selfish with this message?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   But if that is the motivation, that
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.960]   can be a temporary manipulation of your own heart
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.640]   and of your own desires.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.920]   So here are some of the--
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.560]   here's a quote by John MacArthur here.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.160]   "Any manipulation in evangelism may produce short-term results,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.000]   but in the long run, becomes a barrier to genuine belief."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.640]   So when you're motivated by these temporary manipulations,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.240]   many times the content of the message that you're portraying
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.920]   begins to change as well.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.960]   Because you're starting with this person
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.720]   and wanting this person saved, you begin to--
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.600]   without even thinking about it, you
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   can go a little bit secret sensitive in there.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   It just starts to happen.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.360]   But when your motivation is rock solid,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.480]   when it's on God and who he is, and your desire for him
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.600]   to be made known, then everything, again,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.800]   begins to fall into place.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.600]   So here's some lasting motivations, God's purposes.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.920]   Mission statements are statements
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   to govern your approach in life.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.120]   So many companies have this.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   Many people who are kind of driven
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.920]   make mission statements for their own lives.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.160]   I've never really done it before.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.240]   But mission statements are helpful to identify
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.440]   at least some things.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   It helps you make decisions.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.480]   It helps you establish your values.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.160]   It helps you direct where to spend your time and money.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.520]   It helps you know what and why of your to-dos.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.880]   And so for the Christian, our mission statement is biblical.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.640]   And I do believe that our--
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.960]   if you were at the members meeting yesterday,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   our vision for this year is very much our mission statement,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.240]   to know God and to make him known.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.680]   So that's what we're doing.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.120]   If you turn to the next page, what is the mission statement
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.600]   that God presents to us in scripture?
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   This one, please read this on your own.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.280]   But this is the Bible survey for a mission of God.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.600]   This is that idea that God is a missionary God.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.160]   And he desires-- all through the course of scripture,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.480]   you're going to see that he was very, very consumed--
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.680]   you can say jealous for his glory.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.800]   And that is seen in his desire for missions
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.080]   then to happen in the people of God.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.480]   So read that on your own.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.200]   Some of this stuff might be on the quiz,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.280]   so it just adds up for you.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:43.400]   So nothing so much glorifies God as his gracious redemption
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.480]   of damned, hell-bound sinners.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.920]   Fellowship, teaching, and praise are not
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.840]   the mission of the church, but are rather
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.960]   the preparation of the church to fulfill
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.720]   its mission of winning the lost.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.920]   That's by John MacArthur.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.400]   Take a look at that.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.760]   So God is glorified in the redemption
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.000]   of damned, hell-bound sinners.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.720]   But look at this.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.480]   Fellowship, teaching, and praise are not
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.160]   the mission of the church.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.800]   They are not the mission of the church,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.680]   but they prepare the church to fulfill
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.280]   its mission of winning the lost.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.240]   We're very familiar with the fact that when we one day die,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.840]   we're going to be brought into perfect worship before God,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.480]   perfect fellowship before God and one another.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.120]   So why would we work so hard here?
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.360]   Well, there's an aspect of it.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.840]   We're living out our identity.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.760]   But also, that is our testimony to the world,
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.920]   by our love for one another.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.240]   And so God's goals--
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.360]   do I not have these?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.280]   No, that's OK.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.440]   God's goals, it's reconciliation of rebellious sinners
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.200]   with the Holy God.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:54.400]   This time period where sinful man walks this earth,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.480]   it's reconciliation of rebellious sinners
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.200]   with the Holy God.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   And secondly, to present every person complete in Christ,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.160]   to present every person complete in Christ.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.320]   So here's our motivation.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.240]   [TYPING]
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.600]   So in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 15, Emily,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.880]   do you think you could read that for us?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.640]   For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.920]   to more and more people, you increase thanksgiving
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.080]   to the glory of God.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.040]   This is our passion.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   And this is a question you have to ask yourself.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.960]   Is this your passion?
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   It doesn't take long to take a cursory glance
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.080]   at your checkbook, at the way you spend your time,
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.320]   to prove whether you believe this truly or not.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.720]   So there's a difference, remember,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.680]   between the idea of faith without works.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.360]   The belief needs to be able to produce
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.040]   the fruit of that belief.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.200]   And the fruit of the belief proves
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.600]   the faith or the belief.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.960]   We understand that.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.080]   And so we will all say we live to the glory of God,
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   but you have to look at what you've
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.720]   been producing in your life.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.840]   How you've been spending your free time,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   how you've been-- what you've been thinking
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.400]   about when you wake up, what has been the thing that's
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.280]   been bringing you most joy.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.080]   Does that all line up together?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.200]   Is it God's glory?
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.360]   Roman number one, if you are concerned with magnifying
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.720]   the glory of God, there is a simple biblical mathematical
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.680]   equation.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.640]   More people saved equals more people giving glory to God.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.520]   So this is an obvious byproduct.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.040]   If you desire God's glory truly, then you
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.560]   are going to desire God's glory truly in other people as well.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.040]   So if you are jealous for God's glory yourself,
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   then when you see people who are walking around
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.800]   as robbers of God's glory, it drives you crazy.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.320]   There's something that feels off about that.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.920]   And your motivation isn't on this person
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.240]   is dying and going to hell, so much as--
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   there's that compassion that's there, as the first step is,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.920]   man, I need God to be made known in this person's life.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.240]   And a lot of what falls under that becomes,
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.520]   I want them to know God's love.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.860]   I want them to understand God's compassion and kindness
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.600]   and grace.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.680]   But it does not start there.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.300]   And we're going to talk about that, especially next week when
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.520]   we talk about God's holiness.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:29.080]   Christine, can you read for us that quote by MacArthur?
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.480]   "When we worship God, by proclaiming his glory
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.240]   and his clarity, Paul wrote to the Thessalonians,
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.520]   brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.720]   may spread rapidly and be glorified,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.040]   just as it did with you."
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   2 Thessalonians 3, 1.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.120]   "When his word is given exposure,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.600]   when people hear it and are saved, God is glorified."
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.720]   God is glorified.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.360]   I hope when we're evangelizing to people,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.400]   that's what's on our minds, God's glory.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.320]   So we'll get into why this matters so much.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.480]   Ariel, can you read the J.I. Packer quote?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.680]   "We glorify God by evangelizing, not only because evangelizing
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.520]   is an act of obedience, but also because in evangelism,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.120]   we tell the world what great things God has done
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.040]   for the salvation of sinners.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.760]   God is glorified when his mighty works of grace are made known."
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.720]   OK, great.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.520]   So that book was actually out there yesterday, J.I. Packer,
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.040]   "Eve and the Sovereignty of God."
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.880]   And so I think if you still want to purchase those,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.080]   I'm sure they're available.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.920]   Maybe you could talk to June or something.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.800]   All right.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.040]   So Roman numeral number two here,
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.280]   "Because the Lord is worthy of glory, we must evangelize."
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.760]   So there's our motivation for evangelism.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.080]   We evangelize because we are captivated by God's glory.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.120]   We want that so badly.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.640]   And that's real for us.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.200]   So we can't go out there trying to convince ourselves
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.760]   that we're about God's glory.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.680]   We need to already be about that in our everyday living.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.560]   So that's our passion, our heart, love, and obedience.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.080]   Roman numeral one, "Believers are motivated
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.760]   by understanding Christ's command."
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.640]   Agnes, can you read for us John 14, 15?
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.960]   "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.680]   So simple.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.640]   "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.240]   And then 1 John 5, 3, let's go back to Alyssa.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.200]   "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   and his commandments are not burdensome."
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.480]   And then Charlotte, the next one.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.760]   "Let your light shine before men in such a way
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.640]   that they may see your good works,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.600]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.560]   So if you're thinking about your heart,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.440]   yes, we go out of a love for Christ.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   But the love obedience factor comes together.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.720]   Many times, remembering that you need to obey
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   is very helpful in evangelism.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.560]   Because our love many times isn't Christ.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.720]   So when we have a co-worker and we
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.320]   know we should be evangelizing, but we feel nervous to
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.560]   or feel like, oh, maybe later, or I'm
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.880]   going to let my life evangelize, or we make all these excuses,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.480]   it's because you are in love with yourself.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.520]   You love yourself.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.800]   You love how you're perceived, and how you're
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.840]   seen, and your comfort.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.640]   But love is going to produce obedience.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.520]   These are both ends.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.800]   We're going to go out there.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.400]   And sometimes, you know, our spectrum--
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.000]   June, where are we going, by the way?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.640]   Oh, UTC.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.520]   When we're out at UTC, that obedience thing
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.000]   is very helpful to remember.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.760]   And I love Jesus.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.280]   And so I'm going to go as nerve wracking as it might be.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.440]   So the Lord has commanded that we evangelize the world.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.640]   Because we love the Lord, we must obey.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.200]   Roman numeral number two.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   If the purposes of God and a desire to obey Christ
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.440]   do not motivate you to evangelize,
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.040]   you may have a greater fear of man than God.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.840]   Perhaps you are greatly afraid of being rejected by man.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:03.880]   In 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verse 10, it says,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.840]   "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.800]   so that each one may be recompensed
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.040]   for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.240]   whether good or bad.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.840]   Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men."
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.480]   The "we persuade men" is--
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.000]   the knowing is a participle to the "we persuade men"
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.400]   indicative.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.440]   The persuading men is contingent on this
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.960]   knowing the fear of the Lord.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.800]   They're running together here.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.040]   So therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.640]   We are not out there to persuade men, just like that.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.200]   But because of our fear of God.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.560]   But we are made manifest to God.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.920]   And I hope that we are made manifest also
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.200]   in your conscience.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   So what motivates you?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   Fear of man or fear of God?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.200]   In Galatians 1, 6, "I am amazed that you are so quickly
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.400]   deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.880]   for a different gospel, which is really not another.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.640]   Only there are some who are disturbing you
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.480]   and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.400]   But even if we or an angel from heaven
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.160]   should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.400]   preached to you, he is to be accursed.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.560]   As we have said before, so I say again now,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.960]   if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you've
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.560]   received, he is to be accursed."
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.920]   Here it is, verse 10.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   "For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God?
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.040]   Or am I striving to please men?
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.880]   If I were still striving to please men,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:27.200]   I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   If you don't have a desire to obey Christ,
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.720]   you might be motivated by a fear of man
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.960]   or having a different fear other than God.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.760]   There's a few more here in Proverbs 29 and John 14.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.240]   You can look at those on your own.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.720]   Better be.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.040]   Here's another reason why.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.440]   You might not have a pattern of applying God's word.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.200]   Or you have a pattern of not applying God's word.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.800]   So if you're wondering, why am I not in obedience?
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.240]   There's the fear of man and the non-fear of God at play.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.840]   But there's also this thing of maybe you're just simple,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.000]   just not applying what you're reading.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.280]   Because you are regularly exposed,
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.200]   but you do not apply the word, your heart
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.960]   is becoming indifferent.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.080]   This is so scary.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.680]   If you're in a regular habit of reading scripture and yet not
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.560]   applying-- so if you read every day for the next year
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.840]   and yet not applying, you are at risk of becoming
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.960]   indifferent in your heart.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.560]   Christ commands or commands for you,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.640]   but you have gotten into a pattern of seeing them
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.960]   as directed at the general church, but maybe not to you.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.880]   And so we're able to sit-- like when we get together
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.200]   and we say, what have you been reading?
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.400]   What have you been learning?
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   You can say it.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.040]   But only what you've been applying actually matters.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.080]   And this is just my opinion, I think.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   But only what you've been applying
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.880]   is actually something I think you should be sharing
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.320]   that you've been learning this.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.080]   So if you're giving concepts about how we should be,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.600]   there's a lot of-- it could be laced with a lot of judgment,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.160]   actually.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.280]   So many of you might know, there are
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   people who are reading and learning and growing
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.720]   a lot in the knowledge of God, and yet they're not applying.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.400]   And so when their sermons are being aimed at them,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.440]   what are they doing?
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.520]   They're thinking of John and Hannah,
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.440]   and they're not thinking of themselves.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.040]   And this is the danger of that.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.600]   I think the people who are most walking and abiding in Christ
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.320]   are the ones who are the most-- when they're hearing sermons,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.880]   they could be the most mature of Christians,
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.920]   and they could be the most basic of sermons,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.520]   and yet you are struck to the heart.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.320]   I've heard some people who are just walking so well with
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.360]   Christ that they heard the most basic of sermons,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.920]   and they come up, and they're just so broken.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.280]   And you're like, no, that's such a basic Bible thing.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   But that's what happened.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.520]   OK, moving on.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.440]   Our evangelism is God-centered.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.320]   So these big categories we're hitting here-- our passion,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.160]   our heart, our evangelism--
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.520]   probably going to be on the quiz.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.600]   So our evangelism is God-centered.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.640]   Roman numeral 1-- what does it mean to evangelize?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.840]   So we're going to go into a little bit of Greek here.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.240]   The first one, "uangelizo," preach the good news.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.200]   Oh, when you see a double G like that, by the way,
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.720]   this is just FYI.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.760]   We have an NG sound in there, that "ng" sound in there.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.840]   So "uangelizo," preach the good news.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.000]   Preach the good news.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   So in Acts 8.35-- let's keep going here.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.440]   Going over to Frank.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.080]   Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.720]   scripture, he preached Jesus to them.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.280]   Great.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.080]   And then 1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.120]   you're going to see another instance of this word,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.400]   preaching the good news.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   So there is this aspect of that, that we go to preach it.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.560]   But there's another one called "didasko,"
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.120]   teach the good news.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.800]   This goes into teaching and instruction
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.640]   with illustration and producing understanding.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.000]   So there is a biblical difference
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.720]   between preaching and teaching.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.000]   Andy, can you read for us Acts 5.42?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.520]   Every day he'd go from--
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.880]   how's teaching and preaching?
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.360]   There it is.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.880]   So there's something.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.000]   So he labels and puts them side by side.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.200]   So a lot of what we do on Wednesday nights right now
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.880]   or at our home groups is probably
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.800]   more in lines of teaching.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.120]   There are instances where Pastor Mark will be moved
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.400]   by the Spirit, and he'll just start preaching.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.600]   And you kind of feel that.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.640]   But teaching is to really produce understanding.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.360]   And it feels like there's a different purpose in it
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:24.920]   sometimes.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.800]   Acts 15.35, going back to Jason.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.880]   "But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch,
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.080]   teaching and preaching with many others also
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.000]   the word of the Lord."
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.120]   OK, great.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.000]   And then next, another word when we think of evangelism
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.240]   is "keruso," to herald the gospel or to proclaim,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.960]   to invite to fellowship.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.120]   So look at the nuances of each of those things.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.560]   To herald the gospel--
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.760]   this is the man who came before and preceded the king.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.560]   And he would trumpet and say, someone is coming.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.800]   And sometimes he would give the report of the king
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.760]   before the king would actually even come.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.640]   This is what the king is going to talk about.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.600]   It's like an outline.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   He'd say, these are the things he's coming for.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.160]   And the king is going to come, and then he'll do his thing.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.040]   This is Mark 5.20.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.000]   Sorry, I actually printed out for you guys an unedited copy.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.320]   That's Mark chapter 5, verse 20.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.040]   And then, June, can you read that for us?
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.640]   "And he went away and began to proclaim
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.480]   into capitalists what great things Jesus had done for him.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.800]   And everyone was amazed."
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.440]   That word there is "proclaim."
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.240]   So it is this idea of proclamation of God,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.760]   that we are heralding him.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.040]   And in many ways, to kind of complete
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.600]   the image of the herald, it was an invitation.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.760]   So the herald would come to make everyone come out
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.680]   of their homes.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.640]   So when we're going out with the gospel,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.960]   we're preaching, we're teaching.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.600]   But also, there is this aspect of invitation
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.640]   that we're doing in the gospel.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.080]   So if you're going, and you're talking to someone,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.960]   and you're just like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.000]   and then you leave, right?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.320]   In your heart, are you really inviting them?
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.480]   Like, come.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.560]   Like, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.080]   Like what it says in Isaiah 55, come and drink of the wine
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.720]   that you did not purchase, the milk that comes freely to you.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.400]   And eat of the bread that you have no reason to have.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.760]   This is an attractive message.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.840]   And then, letter D, martyreo, this
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.720]   is witness, one who gives knowledge, confirmation,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.280]   or light.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:38.760]   One who gives knowledge, confirmation, or light.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.200]   Sean, do you think you can read for us Galatians, please?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.700]   Sure.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.200]   Galatians 4.15 and 16.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.400]   "Where then is that sense of blessing
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   you have, for I bear you witness that, if possible,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.520]   you have plucked out of your eyes and given them to me.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.840]   So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?"
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.640]   OK.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.520]   So this idea of witness, for I bear you witness
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.560]   that that word, if you look at the word martyreo,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.600]   you see the word martyr hidden in there.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.640]   And it is the same word.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.440]   It's the exact same word, actually.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.080]   So when we're called witnesses, or even the word testimony,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.360]   it actually is the word for murder.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.280]   That the testimony that we're giving is our life.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.480]   And by giving our testimony, we're
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.840]   saying that our life is wrapped up in this,
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.400]   and that we will lose our life for this.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.560]   So that idea of witness is found in scripture as well.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.200]   So we must speak and communicate a distinct message.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.400]   All of these terms refer to the-- this
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   is verbal communication.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.320]   Verbal communication, or transmission of the gospel.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.280]   So just as God revealed truth to us,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.680]   we have to reveal truth to the unsaved.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   In redemptive history, the mysteries of God
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.120]   were not incomprehensible anomalies.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.960]   They were truths known only to God, but now revealed.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.560]   In order to truly evangelize, we must speak the message of God.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.520]   So all four of those do require verbal communication.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.800]   There is a fallacy of lifestyle evangelism
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.440]   that probably pervades the church, where
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.640]   you think that just by the way I live, hopefully
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.600]   they will come to know Christ.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.080]   Or you're hoping that they will ask you.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.120]   It's not wrong.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.240]   It's helpful.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.360]   But I'm going to tell you straight up,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.520]   that's not evangelism.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.400]   It's OK to do, and it is actually very beneficial to do.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.800]   And we should all be having an idea of our lifestyles
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.560]   preaching something, but it is not evangelism.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.600]   So don't let the sinful part of your heart--
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.720]   you know, the Jeremiah 17, 9, the hardest deceitful part--
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.120]   trick you into thinking that maybe this
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.360]   is some form of evangelism.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.800]   It is not.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.840]   You are not obeying the command to evangelize
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.240]   when you're just hoping that your lifestyle communicates
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.740]   something.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.520]   OK.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.320]   Where are we here?
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.080]   OK.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.000]   Oh, good.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.640]   We're making good time.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.360]   So again, this is the most heavy in terms of just getting
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.600]   a lot of stuff out there.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Roman numeral 2 here, what makes evangelism God-centered?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.120]   This is another read on your own thing.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.700]   I don't have the read on your own things
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.240]   very often in this class, but there was just
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.200]   so much material.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.620]   This was actually a 10-week course when I first started it,
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.640]   and then crunched it down to six.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.240]   So this is just really good.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.600]   If you look at it, you're going to see, man,
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.000]   am I really focused on the right motivation?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.200]   And if you look down the left column versus the right column,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   this is a very challenging thing.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.880]   Like, you're going to see yourself, man,
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.600]   I've been kind of given to this left side that kind of
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.280]   naturally--
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.840]   like, we have a man-centered approach to evangelism.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.960]   We love talking about God's chief attribute of love,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.560]   the point of contact.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.360]   What do we start off with in our point of contact?
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.760]   Do we have this idea of man is sick and ignorant?
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.280]   I thought the outreach team did a great job just very,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.840]   very in a short amount of time to sharing
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.280]   what is the beginning point in many of these,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.480]   and why is it that we need to be trained in preaching
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.720]   the gospel, not because we don't know the gospel,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.000]   but because many times our motivation in the gospel
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.120]   is wrong.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.080]   And so it starts off wrong, and honestly speaking,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.360]   many times we don't even get to the heart of it.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.680]   So we start it off wrong with right material,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.040]   and because it stops at a certain point,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.200]   the right material with the wrong starting point
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.480]   produces a complete false gospel.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.880]   If you're able to continue that message,
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.440]   it's OK to start in different places.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.160]   So that's a lot of what we're going to talk about.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.280]   There's going to be four things that we
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.440]   go over the next four weeks, which is God, man, Jesus, us.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.600]   But you don't need to go in that order.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.040]   In everyday conversation, they might bring up something
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.600]   about Jesus dying on the cross, and you might start there.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.280]   But you have to come back to God being holy and creator.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.760]   And so you might feel like, hey, I
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.160]   confess that Jesus is Lord yesterday.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.960]   You might start there, that someone randomly said that
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.560]   because they went out to harvest crusade or something,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.120]   but you got to get back to the gospel
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.360]   and make sure that all points are hit.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.800]   I start a lot of times with man being sinful,
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.560]   not even God being holy or creator.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.640]   I start a lot of times with man being sinful.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.920]   But you have to go back to these things.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.440]   So the thing is, if we're starting in these places
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.600]   and we never get to the crux of the gospel,
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.480]   we do a big disservice to him.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.280]   That's why I think a lot of testimonies
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.560]   that I receive, even from Christians,
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.240]   because we're very man-centered naturally,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.160]   I see testimonies that say, I was depressed and lonely
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.280]   and lost, and God came and saved me.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.200]   Is that truth?
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.240]   Me too.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.160]   But is that what he came to save us from?
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.960]   No.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.520]   That was the result of my sin.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.800]   He did not come to save me from depression and loneliness.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.360]   Honestly, you deserve to be lonely and depressed
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.120]   and all that.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.000]   That kind of stuff came out--
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.520]   sometimes I'm talking to younger students.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.840]   And I actually talked to a youth student this past--
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.320]   our church's youth retreat.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.120]   And then they're saying, yeah, I'm struggling with depression,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.880]   and this is hard, and these are the reasons why.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.520]   But God brings comfort into my heart.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.840]   And I was staring at him.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.040]   And I was like, but you know what?
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.240]   Honestly, I don't want God to comfort you in that place.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.720]   I don't think that's what he's doing.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.000]   Actually, I think you're living in sin.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.120]   And that kind of thing is self-produced.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.480]   And so a lot of our evangelism, you have to ask yourself,
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.000]   is it God-centered or is it man-centered?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.160]   It's very tempting to be man-centered.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.200]   Someone might break down in front of you crying,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.440]   because they feel like their life is just so hard.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.640]   And in that place, you might say,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.800]   but God came to save you from that.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's so tempting to be man-centered,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.200]   because there is an iota of truth in there.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.160]   But God did not come to save them from just that darkness.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.760]   You have to kind of clump these things together.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.160]   That is a result of your sin.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   That is what God came to save you from.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.200]   He cannot just pluck you out of your darkness.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.480]   You need to surrender and repent before him of your sin.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.920]   And only in that place, you'll produce true joy, true peace,
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.640]   true happiness.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.920]   OK, so going to the next page here.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:03.200]   Where am I?
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.040]   Did I go off script?
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:11.240]   Evangelism God-centered.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.480]   Did I go in order?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.880]   Did I skip a page?
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.920]   I'm in order, right?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.360]   We're on page six right now?
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.440]   Is this thing on page six?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.880]   No, it's not.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.040]   That's page four.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.280]   This is page four?
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.200]   Oopsies.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.320]   Sorry.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   What makes-- God's message.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.440]   Are we back on track now?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   Where am I?
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.040]   You're right.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.460]   OK.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.240]   OK, here we go.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.800]   God-centered EV must be dedicated to accuracy
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.320]   in presenting God's revelation.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:51.480]   So let's preach God's message.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.120]   And then, therefore, we do not measure evangelism
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.600]   by how did they feel after they listened,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.920]   or how did I feel after I shared.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.400]   How many are attending my church now as a result?
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.640]   We ask the question instead, was the message of Christ
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   proclaimed and laid upon the unbeliever to believe?
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.760]   Did you preach and teach?
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.840]   Did you proclaim?
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.000]   Did you invite?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.520]   The gospel-- via the gospel.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.640]   And nothing else matters after that.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.880]   You can feel rotten because they yelled in your face
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   after you preached the gospel.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.160]   And yet, God is smiling.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:34.560]   You can go about it and say, man, they left
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.080]   and they were angry.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.480]   Or they just look uncomfortable.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.320]   The entire time I'm saying something,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.520]   they just look uncomfortable.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.820]   And you're like, oh, man, I don't feel good about this.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.920]   And yet, I'll say, man, that was faithful preaching
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.200]   of God's word.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.360]   That was great evangelism.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.760]   God well-- no, God well--
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.400]   job well done.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.280]   We did something dumb in the college ministry.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.440]   It's like this idea of when can you do the victory dance?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.080]   And then they start boomeranging.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.680]   They would go and preach the gospel.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.600]   It was helpful because I think a lot of them,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.000]   as they would come out, they'd be discouraged.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.440]   And then the two of them would look at each other and say,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.240]   hey, did we preach the gospel, though?
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   Were we faithful in presenting who God is to them?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.080]   And were our hearts all in it?
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.440]   And do we care about this person?
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.720]   It's like, yeah.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.800]   Then we feel kind of junkier now.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   And they walked away, and we probably ruined their day.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.880]   And yet, you could do the victory dance in that.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.520]   This was good.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.240]   This was so good.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.280]   Now, let's go do that again.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   That's going to happen.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.000]   You're going to be out at UTC, and someone's just
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.240]   going to be so uncomfortable.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.160]   And you're going to be uncomfortable
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.400]   because they're uncomfortable.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:56.200]   And yet, your vision, your whole window,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.520]   is it being taken up by this person?
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.800]   Or is it completely filled by the vision of who God is?
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.360]   And so they're uncomfortable, but it doesn't change you
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.720]   even one bit.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.800]   You're just like, you're going because of it.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.440]   Number two, God-centered EV must be holistic in preaching
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.480]   the biblical worldview and not necessarily exhaustive.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.320]   Very, very important here.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.000]   Holistic but not necessarily exhaustive.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.480]   So holistic means you're hitting all the points.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   And we're going to be doing that the next four weeks
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:41.080]   in the God/Man/Jesus response idea of the gospel.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.880]   And there are some students who came back,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.280]   and they were asking, hey, in every time we're
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.880]   preaching the gospel, do we need to get to all four?
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.400]   And honestly, the answer is no to that.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.840]   But you need to be driving to do that.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.960]   And at any point, if they just cut the conversation,
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.480]   it's OK.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.640]   You can't do anything to keep them going.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.880]   But if you can, your holistic approach is the goal.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.480]   Now, you're going to come across people
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   who are more interested.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.480]   Then you start exhausting it a little bit.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.880]   You start going deeper into each point.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.440]   But our goal is holistic.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.800]   So letter A here, "Therefore, we cannot push one recorded
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.960]   message or focus on just the love of God."
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.480]   I know this can be a temptation.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.520]   There's a sermon that really spoke to you
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.760]   at a certain point in your life.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.160]   And so you have a recording of it.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.560]   And you say, just listen to this.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.000]   That's actually really good to do.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.920]   But that is not the end goal.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.520]   That's not going to quite do it.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.040]   You also can't ask the question, what's the minimum
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.480]   that I have to share?
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.680]   What are the basic elements that are the bare minimum
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.320]   of what will save you?
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.920]   An unbeliever is required to believe
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.560]   all that is God's truth.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.760]   Thus, your goal is to present a holistic, biblical worldview
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.360]   of salvation.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.440]   Again, we're going to hit this over and over again
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.560]   in the next few lectures.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.920]   And the message is not the same as your testimony.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.320]   This means that your personal journey to faith
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.480]   is not the same as the message itself.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.080]   You can definitely share the gospel in your testimony.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.120]   But if you're sitting there just talking about your own walk,
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.520]   that's not it.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.880]   I felt just like you.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.080]   I was right where you were.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.640]   This will help you maybe become a vehicle into the gospel.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.600]   But don't let that become the thing that's
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.920]   supposed to change this person.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.160]   God's method.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.360]   God-centered ED involves the local church
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.280]   as not only integral, but primary.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.680]   It's not only integral, but primary.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.760]   And here's the error.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.080]   Pragmatics has been a major confusion and error
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.560]   in the methodology of modern evangelism.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   In an effort to make the church more successful,
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.400]   like being relevant, effective, winsome, or appealing,
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.320]   church leaders have adopted philosophies and methodologies
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.040]   that compromise the message of salvation
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.560]   by compromising the mode.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.680]   So the church is primary in this.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.160]   And then number two, God-centered ED
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   involves the lifestyle witness of each member of the church.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:22.920]   Involves the lifestyle witness of each member of the church.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.240]   And this chart that you see below here
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.000]   is basically a lot of different instances
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.680]   where evangelism is happening.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.280]   You see Paul evangelizing in circumstance.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.960]   He's in jail, and he's just evangelizing
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.080]   in that circumstance, even in a difficult circumstance.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.040]   You see them going house to house many times.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.000]   You see them preaching open air.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.440]   You'll see many conversations happening.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.080]   So evangelism is a lifestyle.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.880]   And so this one right here--
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.280]   kind of getting tired of talking.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.160]   Isn't it cool?
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.440]   OK, can you read this for us, the next paragraph?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.720]   Evangelism is a deeply linked to life and relationships.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.200]   Whether in the synagogue, or the marketplace, or the home,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.680]   the gospel is communicated through life studies.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.160]   Evangelism is linked to life and the events of life.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.120]   Within a program, it is a practice.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.600]   You don't see it in the Bible.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.080]   People don't get time to go evangelize.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.040]   Whenever there is an unbeliever, they share the gospel.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.400]   So you understand that a little bit?
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.320]   There was a very reason with college ministry,
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.840]   I was very hesitant to set a weekly evangelism time.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.400]   But we are evangelizing and things like that.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.280]   It's because that idea of setting the time to evangelize
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.520]   is not what evangelism is.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.000]   Through the church, you can do that.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.960]   And that's what we're doing in March.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.120]   It's great that we can all go do that together.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.440]   But if that's like, see, I am evangelizing,
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.760]   you would be incorrect in that.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.840]   Because evangelism is more natural than anything else.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.000]   In your relationship-- that's why in this chart,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.680]   like this Paul's in jail, he's just evangelizing.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   And then he's going house to house,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.360]   intentionally evangelizing.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.200]   And he goes out open air preaching.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.440]   And then in conversation, he's evangelizing.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.560]   That is, again, remember going back,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.480]   this is the mission of our life.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.800]   So the church, to grow the church in a holy huddle
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.480]   is not the mission of our church or even our lives.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.720]   We're being equipped.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.320]   Even that's what it says in Ephesians 4.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.680]   It says that these people were developed and brought up
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.400]   and chosen by God and given these gifts
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.920]   to equip the saints to do the work of ministry.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.640]   The work of ministry isn't just like relegated to like, oh,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.280]   what I do is clean up ministry or parking ministry.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   What we're doing as a church is we're
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.120]   trying to comprehensively do church together,
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.360]   that our church would, yes, be building each other up.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.720]   You see it in our four visions.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.280]   But ultimately, that we're going out and preaching the gospel.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.320]   That is actually our ultimate mission and goal.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.800]   And so if your mission statement is kind of going along
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.400]   with all of our mission statement,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.720]   really, this is so challenging.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.960]   This is so, so challenging.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.240]   You look at your life and say, but has that been my goal?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.080]   Has that been my mission?
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.920]   And then the second danger is to then jump into,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.240]   I have to go evangelize.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.840]   But that's important on this lecture.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.600]   You can't go from, but have I been doing that?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.480]   To, I have to go do that.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.520]   It has to be, but has my passion been for God's glory?
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.680]   Has my heart been a love and obedience to Christ?
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.040]   We have to fill that in so that the I have to go evangelize
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.920]   becomes real.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.480]   And hopefully, when we go out to--
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.080]   after we do this and you guys are evangelizing,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.920]   that motivation is corrected.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.400]   OK.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:47.960]   We are almost there.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.000]   Our confidence, God's sovereignty.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.960]   Oh, I love this part, that we go out in so much confidence.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.120]   Sometimes, even now, I just don't like
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.720]   talking to people very much.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.680]   And so when I'm out there, the adrenaline rush is very real.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.240]   Every time I go, I hate this.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.480]   I hate this.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.840]   Every time.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.360]   Every time.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   But I drown it out.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.880]   And I feel, actually-- and it's not
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.000]   like one of those fake things where you're like,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.080]   like you're not afraid.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.560]   It's not one of those things.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.000]   It's like you drown it out by remembering our confidence
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.600]   is truly in God's sovereignty.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.560]   And this will, time and time again,
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.880]   rescue your sinful, fleshly heart.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.760]   Time and time again.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.320]   And so you need to come back to this over and over again.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.960]   We must be careful to distinguish the results
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.560]   from the efforts.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.640]   The results from the efforts.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.140]   Let's see.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.800]   Andrew, can you read for us that quote?
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.920]   "The results of preaching depend not
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.240]   on the wishes and intentions of men,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.160]   but on the will of God Almighty.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.280]   Consideration does not mean that we should be indifferent as
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.760]   to whether we see fruit from our witness to Christ or not.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.640]   We are not to define evangelism in terms of achieved results."
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   Oh, so good, right?
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.160]   So good.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.840]   It's not-- who cares about what you see?
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.280]   Who knows what God is doing in that?
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.960]   Ultimately, we want to see it, and that's
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.120]   where discipleship comes up.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.400]   We're going to go into that in one of your resources.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.680]   But man, that's why the whole victory dance thing,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.180]   you know?
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.640]   That idea of at the end, when can you really
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.960]   just celebrate and rejoice?
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.680]   The only thing that you have control of is your preaching.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.720]   Have you been faithful?
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   And has evangelism truly occurred?
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.000]   And then the real celebration will continue
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.240]   as hopefully you see things happening in this person
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.200]   later on.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:52.640]   But for us, the idea is that we're not
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.560]   going to try to force fruit.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.160]   And if we don't see that fruit, then we
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.280]   feel all sad and miserable.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.560]   We're confident every time.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.360]   Every time we evangelize, we're confident,
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.320]   regardless of what we see, because it's not based on them.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.720]   OK, the goals of God will--
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.560]   the goals of God will not be accomplished
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.400]   by the ingenuity, determination, the strength,
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.160]   nor the might of man.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.280]   It will be accomplished by the grace and power of God.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.680]   Oh, such confidence.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   You don't matter.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.920]   You matter a ton, because God tells you to go do it.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.080]   But you don't matter at the end of it,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.280]   because God is the one accomplishing by His grace
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.440]   and power.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.040]   And you leave there, and if you did that,
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.920]   then you've left that moment doing
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.640]   exactly what is needed for God to do
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.520]   some kind of work in their lives.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.920]   Now, they might disobey, and they might resist Him,
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.160]   if they're not truly being called by Him
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.720]   at that point in the moment.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.560]   But for us, where we kind of leave off,
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.200]   we're saying, we could have temporarily
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.160]   manipulated this person to say something, or to feel something,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   or even to cry.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.360]   But if the gospel wasn't faithfully preached,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.880]   I'd say, man, that was not good.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.280]   But if you did, then it was really good.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.880]   Therefore, we can trust that God's message and God's methods
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.000]   are fully effective.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.920]   We can focus on following His plan and ordained agenda.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.640]   We do the preaching, teaching, proclaiming, witnessing.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.840]   We do that.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.920]   We do it God-centered, not man-centered.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.840]   We do it with God's glory in mind, not man's glory in mind.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.120]   We do it because we love Him and we desire to obey Him.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.000]   We do all of that, and we can trust
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.240]   that that is fully effective.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.320]   Don't stray from His plan, unordained agenda.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.400]   Letter B, therefore, we can have hope and persevere.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.440]   Knowing that the giving of faith and the salvation
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.360]   from His judgment is in God's hands
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.280]   frees us to continue in prayer and obedience
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.360]   to God's call to evangelize.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.520]   We can hope and persevere because--
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.280]   I like the word "freeze us."
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.360]   Knowing that all of it now is in God's hands,
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.320]   that you've done your part, and now maybe you
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.080]   need to follow up.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.840]   You've done your part.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.640]   Now you can pray in freedom.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.280]   Now, can you pray for God to save their hearts
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.520]   when you gave the wrong gospel message?
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.080]   I don't know how you pray there.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.920]   You should probably pray in repentance.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.500]   But if you've faithfully preached God's message
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.320]   and you did it without catering to man,
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.680]   without trembling before man and a fear of man,
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.160]   and you did it because you love God,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.960]   and you really feel like you did a faithful job of presenting
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.040]   who He is, then you can pray saying, God, use it.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.720]   God, do a work.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.880]   Whatever seed was planted, God, make it sprout.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.520]   Don't let the enemy take that away.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.560]   All that kind of stuff can be there.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.060]   And then Roman numeral number two, pray relentlessly
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.640]   and rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.300]   Pray relentlessly and rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.860]   Kevin, can you read for us Romans 10.1?
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.460]   Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.780]   is for their salvation.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.340]   Thank you.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.740]   It's the desire and the prayer.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.780]   Don't gloss over so quickly why both are put there.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:23.420]   He could have said, I pray for God to save them.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.940]   Or he could say, my desire to God is--
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.740]   or my desire is for them to have salvation.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.140]   But he puts both in.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.960]   My heart's desire and my prayer to God for them
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.540]   is for their salvation.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.220]   John 16.8.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:36.920]   Who's behind you?
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.900]   Oh, Lissy?
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.400]   Oh, hi.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.380]   And He, when He comes, will convict the world
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.780]   concerning sin and righteousness and judgment.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.780]   He will do the convicting work.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.500]   And Colossians 4.3-4.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.780]   Next.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.780]   Praying at the same time for us as well,
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.260]   that God may open up to us the door for the word,
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.740]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.740]   for which I am also a saint in Christ.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.260]   All right.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.000]   So here are a couple of questions for us.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.380]   Do you intercede on behalf of unbelievers?
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.660]   The word intercede is not a one-time word.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.620]   It's a continuation word.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.260]   Do you intercede on behalf of unbelievers continuously?
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:18.940]   Do you pray for more opportunities to come your way?
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.300]   That's a big one.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.220]   Do you pray fervently for that?
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.260]   God, please, today, let it be today,
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.620]   with this co-worker or with this roommate
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:31.340]   or with this child or whatever, that you would
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.620]   give an opportunity for me.
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.380]   When you pray for opportunity, by the way, when it comes,
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.740]   you're all the more ready to jump on it.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.860]   When you don't, and opportunity comes, you're like, oh, boy.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:44.580]   You're like, kind of like, ooh, should I?
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.940]   Should I not?
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.860]   But when you're praying, when it comes, you're like, oh,
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.620]   I prayed for this.
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.460]   Let's go.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.100]   And so it's pretty cool.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.780]   Do you pray for greater boldness?
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.100]   If you know, if one of the check marks in the beginning
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:02.020]   was like, nah, I'm shy, I'm timid, well, great.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.820]   You're self-aware.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.860]   What do you do with your self-awareness?
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.420]   Do you pray, like, God, make me confident.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.700]   Let me not fear them and things like that.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.940]   Do you actually pray for that?
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.100]   Do you pray for conviction of sin?
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.640]   These are great things to pray about.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.660]   Letter B, God ordains the end and ordains the means.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.460]   He ordains how they will be saved.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.220]   So rely upon his work.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.540]   And that brings us to the end of the motivation
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.740]   for evangelism.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   Are there any questions?
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:43.580]   OK, so to review, our mission is God's purpose.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.900]   Our passion is God's glory.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.460]   Our heart is love and obedience.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.340]   Our evangelism is God-centered.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.940]   Our confidence is God's sovereignty.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.780]   So take time to meditate on that a little bit.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:02.660]   And again, remember, apply to see, like, where am I?
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.480]   Like, am I evaluating where I am and how I've been thinking
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.460]   and how I've been evangelizing?
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.820]   Or have I just been praying a lot for someone to be saved
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.100]   and I've been doing nothing about it?
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:13.780]   We do that a lot.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.060]   We pray like-- like, every prayer is a prayer.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.860]   I feel like we're praying for unbelievers, which we ought to be.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.020]   And we pray for unbelievers.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.260]   My question is, like, yeah, but since we prayed,
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.380]   did anything happen?
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.380]   You know, did I go and--
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.660]   did that prayer produce something in me?
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.700]   And did that prayer produce more prayer?
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:36.540]   And, you know, and so let's try to get our mission kind of
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.900]   straight here together, you know,
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.500]   that we are so consumed by it.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.900]   And a lot of times, we will hear sermons, and we're like, man,
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.380]   I got to stop wasting time.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.580]   Like, the sermon application is, I
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.740]   have to stop watching so much Netflix.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.260]   Or, you know, I have to, like, stop
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.940]   vegging so much when I get home from work
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.660]   and just I'm on Instagram.
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.780]   You know, like, those are such weak convictions.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.500]   You know, the strong convictions actually
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.140]   hit both the positive and negative,
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.580]   like the put off, put on principles, right?
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.860]   That if it's just to not be lazy, like, come on, you know?
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.300]   It's just to not waste my time?
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.340]   Oh, that's like, we got to do more than that.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.740]   Like, our motivation needs to be like,
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.420]   we are so captivated by who God is,
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.500]   and it's not even just the hatred of sin,
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.300]   but it's this whole world view that we
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.300]   have of this ticking time that we have in this world, right?
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.060]   And we're so consumed with Him, and we come home like,
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.740]   can you waste time?
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.620]   It's different than just like, you know,
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.900]   I'm going to watch a show or a movie.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.220]   This is very different than just wasting time, right?
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.180]   We know we can go watch a movie, but can you really
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.940]   waste time when you have this mission in life,
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.140]   you have this goal in life?
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.260]   So we get so captivated on what we're not supposed to do,
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.980]   but I think what we ought to do should be many times feeding
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.340]   into that, you know?
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:08.460]   So I did hear that in the past where
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.340]   a bunch of people who committed adultery,
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.500]   they were interviewed, and these psychologists came by
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.220]   and were asking them all these questions,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:18.700]   and very interesting.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:26.180]   The final conclusion was that adulterers, where it happens,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.380]   where adultery occurs isn't when they
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.580]   fall in love with someone else or attraction to someone else.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.380]   It's when they fall out of love with their wife.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.260]   So it's this idea of like--
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.140]   and this was just like a secular study,
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.740]   but I'm like, there's some truth in this,
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.300]   where when your love for the Lord is so great,
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.260]   like what you see in Philippians 3, 7, 3, 11,
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.940]   actually happens.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.700]   It's not you're staring at these things,
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.280]   and you're trying to convince yourself
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.940]   of the rubbish of these things.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.420]   But when you're captivated by something so much greater
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.940]   and more beautiful and of more value and worth,
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.420]   that it happens.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.300]   The rubbish happens.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.820]   And so evangelism is-- that's why the motivation is
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:10.260]   the most important thing.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.260]   You could be here saying, train me for evangelism,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.180]   and you can go out with the wrong motivation,
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.220]   and it did nothing.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:23.380]   So homework-wise, these are two very short readings.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.940]   So if you want to know-- you can go and look at it yourself,
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.860]   but this will probably take you a few minutes
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.620]   to go through this.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.500]   Is this in the packet?
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.500]   It's in the packet.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.380]   It's in the resources section of your packet.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:36.340]   Yes.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.300]   So if you look at your homework paper,
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.140]   or the-- is it the table of contents?
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.340]   The table of contents shows you homework 1, homework 1,
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.460]   homework 2, homework 2, things like that.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.180]   So homework 1 is after lecture 1.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.580]   Homework 2 is after lecture 2.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.860]   And then you're going to be reading Islam and Roman
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.780]   Catholicism.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.500]   And try to kind of play with the material a little bit,
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.620]   because later on, I'm going to be kind of printing out things,
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.780]   and we're going to be doing the office thing,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.220]   where you put the thing on your forehead, walk around.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.740]   You're going to be play-acting like a Muslim or Roman
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.780]   Catholic, as well as flipping it around
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.900]   and being the Christian that's evangelizing to the Roman
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.220]   Catholic.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:22.860]   So do your best, and then don't need to do that.
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.980]   You don't need to do that, and you're good.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.380]   Well, let me pray for us.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.380]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.580]   The quiz, is it just going to come from the lectures,
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.180]   or the--
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.660]   Lecture and the homework.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.060]   The religion and the resources, or just,
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.540]   is it lectures and the homework?
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.500]   You know, I won't put the religions in there.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.020]   Oh, OK.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.860]   And the memory verses, can you go over the purpose
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.380]   of memorizing those verses again?
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.140]   Sure.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.340]   So there are four lectures.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.220]   The next four is going to be on God, man, Jesus, us,
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.700]   or response.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.940]   And each of those four points of the gospel,
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.100]   we're going to be having memory verses that go along with it.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.780]   And it's supposed to help you to remember
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.620]   when you're preaching the gospel, when you're
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.300]   evangelizing to people, that you have these memory verses that
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.580]   are going to be there to give you
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:10.220]   the authority of God's word behind you,
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.860]   so that you're not just relying on your own words.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:17.180]   But also to remember, this is indeed scripture and biblical.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   So--
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.860]   This is for homework two, three, and five.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.700]   But there's evangelism outreach on March 7th.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.660]   Is that EV?
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:28.460]   Is that what EV is referring to?
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.860]   OK.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.360]   Oh, yeah?
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.220]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.660]   I'm talking about the outreach.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.340]   The outreach.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.820]   Are you talking about the calendar?
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:36.820]   Oh, OK, OK.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.540]   Because at the end of Romans number five,
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.780]   it's just CU and EV.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.660]   Oh, I didn't edit that.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:45.860]   That was for my college students.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.460]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.660]   OK.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.420]   If you guys find those mistakes, if you're
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.380]   like one of those ones that you get really annoyed by it,
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.940]   can you actually-- can you message me?
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.260]   Can you message me and say, like, oh, on this page of--
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.540]   and it will be helpful to not distract future classes.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.700]   So OK.
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.260]   Well, let's pray.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.900]   God, thank you so much for this group.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.780]   And I pray that we would take time
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.460]   to let these truths go deep into our hearts
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.260]   and challenge ourselves to ask, how have we been evangelizing?
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.500]   What have our lives been about?
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.820]   God, even as we look forward to evangelizing in March,
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.620]   God, is our desire just to scratch a guilty conscience?
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.660]   Or Father, is it because we truly
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.780]   do have a love and obedience before you?
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.500]   God, do we truly care about your glory?
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.180]   And Father, that we would take time
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:41.020]   to take stock of our lives, to look deep,
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.260]   and see if we believe what we're saying.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.780]   And so Lord, help us not to be people
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.380]   who desire just to be trained or discipled in certain ways.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.660]   But God, it is truly because of the shepherd we love and follow.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:56.220]   Amen.
