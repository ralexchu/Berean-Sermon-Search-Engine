[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.140]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.140]   We will now begin the time of worship.

[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   - All right, good morning.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.140]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.140]   We have a few announcements this morning,
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.140]   so we're gonna just jump right into it.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   We have an announcement from our youth group,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   from our teacher, Adam.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:55.140]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   Today, the youth group is having a bake sale
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.140]   that's happening for our youth group retreat
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   that's gonna be in about two weeks.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.140]   So we'll be selling at two locations.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   There's one inside the cafe,
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   right next to drinks and everything,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   and then there's one that's gonna be
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.140]   right outside the cafe.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.140]   It'd be great to have your support
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   for our youth kids and for our winter retreat.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   You can pay with Venmo, to the Breen Venmo,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   and with cash.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.140]   Thanks.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.140]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.140]   - All right, so those of you who are concerned
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.140]   about sanitation, it's all packaged neatly,
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.140]   And even if that bothers you,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.140]   they are taking money.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.140]   Even if you don't, choose not to pick it up.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.140]   So they worked hard to get that stuff ready,
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   so it's outside and inside the cafe.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   So please go visit that and support them.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.140]   We have another round of membership classes
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.140]   taking place starting next Sunday
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   from nine to 1020.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   So if you are desiring to become a member
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   in the church, it is an eight-week course,
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.140]   so please sign up for that.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   And then it's gonna be taking place
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.140]   on the second floor in this building,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   and the best way to get there is from the outside,
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.140]   and you just go up the stairs in the front
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.140]   of the building, and that's where the class
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.140]   is gonna be taking place at 9 a.m.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.140]   First Peter Bible Study sign-ups.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.140]   If you haven't signed up, please sign up by today,
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.140]   because all the small groups and various things
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   have already kind of been started to be put into place.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   But again, I want to just encourage you
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.140]   that this is not primarily for fellowship.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.140]   It's for the Bible study, so if for whatever the reason
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.140]   you feel like you're not gonna be able to make
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   more than half or a lot of the things,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   this probably is not for you.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.140]   There are other fellowships that you can participate in,
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   but you will need to commit to that,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.140]   at least for the length of the time
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   that we have this Bible study.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.140]   But if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.140]   please sign up as soon as you can,
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.140]   by today if possible.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.140]   This coming Friday, we have All Church Praise and Prayer.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.140]   We will have outside seating available
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.140]   for those of you who are more comfortable
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.140]   seating outside for this Friday,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.140]   but this coming Friday at 7.30,
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   we're gonna be having that, and then obviously
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   our Bible study's gonna be kicking off the following week.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.140]   Next Sunday at 2.30, we're gonna be having
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.140]   the All Church Members Meeting.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.140]   We are going to live stream it,
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.140]   because there are quite a few people
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.140]   who will be watching online.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   We don't normally do that,
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.140]   but we are gonna do that for this one.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.140]   And so at 2.30, it'll give you enough time
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   to go grab lunch and then be back here at 2.30,
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.140]   but that's next Sunday.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   This is the beginning of the year,
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   and usually there's a lot of information
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   that we need to share, like financial status
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   and all this other stuff, so we encourage you to be there.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   And if you can't come, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.140]   And then there's two classes that are starting
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.140]   on February 6th, spiritual development courses.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   One is the Bible Lab, and those of you
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   who are new to the church who wanna study
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.140]   how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.140]   which is what we're doing during the weekday,
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.140]   on Wednesday and then in our home groups.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   And so it's either to refresh your ability
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.140]   to be able to do that, or if you're new to the church,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   that's a great way for you to get help
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.140]   so that you can get the most out of the Bible study
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.140]   that's happening during the weekdays.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.140]   So Pastor Mark will be teaching that
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.140]   on Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. starting from February 6th,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   and then Pastor Peter Chung is gonna be teaching
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.140]   New Testament Survey.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.140]   So those of you who took Old Testament Survey,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   again, this is kind of like second part to that,
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.140]   and if you haven't taken survey classes before,
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   it makes a huge difference on how you are able
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:34.140]   to understand the Bible, understanding the thought flow,
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.140]   why are there four gospels, how has the Bible been organized,
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   what are the books that were written earlier and later,
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.140]   and so certain themes that are in there.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.140]   And so when you do actually go into the study,
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.140]   it helps you to get more out of it.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   So if you haven't taken that,
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.140]   I highly encourage you to take that.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.140]   Pastor Peter Chung will be teaching that.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.140]   Again, the first class will be taking place on February 6th.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.140]   After our worship, I'll give you a minute
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   to give your offering.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.140]   Today we have Enoch Kwon.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.140]   He's gonna come and be baptized,
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.140]   so he'll be coming up after the worship set
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   to give his testimony and be baptized.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   So let me pray for us for our offering,
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.140]   and again, if you are new to the church,
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.140]   our physical offering basket is in the back
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   underneath that clock, okay?
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.140]   Let's pray.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   Gracious Father, we pray that in the midst
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   of all that is going on around us,
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:35.140]   we thank you that we're able to anchor in you,
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.140]   that we do not approach all that happens around us,
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   whether economically, health-wise, politically,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   that we are tossed back and forth, Lord God,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   with every wind of doctrine,
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   every change, Lord God, of what's going on.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.140]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.140]   We pray, Father, that you would give us strength,
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.140]   soberness, and that you would prepare us, Lord God,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.140]   not just for this week, but for the rest of this year
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.140]   to really pursue you with all our might.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   We ask that you would bless this time,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   bless the offering that we give,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.140]   may it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   - All right, good morning, everyone.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   For once, I'm not an undergrad computer science major
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   at UC Irvine, so I'm sorry to disappoint
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   and for breaking that trend.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   [laughter]
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   Well, let's go ahead and get started.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   My name is Enoch, and to start things off,
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   I would just like to say that growing up
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.280]   during my younger years, I absolutely hated my name.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   I know there's one other Enoch somewhere in this church.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   I'm not sure if he feels the same way
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   or if he's braver than I am.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   Who knows? I might talk to him later.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.280]   But I would have countless nicknames,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   like Enoch, Eggnog, and my personal favorite, Enoosh.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   I'm not sure where that comes from.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   So as a chubby Korean 14-year-old boy,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.280]   I didn't dare correct my massive ex-NFL player of a coach.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   So for three years, I was formally Enoosh,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   all right, growing up.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   But at least my wrestling coach got it right,
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   so I stuck with that sport a little longer.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   Anyhoo, without digressing too much,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   like many other Korean Americans,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   I grew up in a Presbyterian church.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   So specifically as a pastor's kid,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   as I got older, I really began to understand
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   why I was named Enoch.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   However, as I previously stated,
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   I honestly did not like my name,
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   and I didn't really want to live up to what it really meant.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   So once again, growing up, I was more afraid of people
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   mispronouncing my name at the local Starbucks
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   rather than understanding the strong Christian roots
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   from which it was derived.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   So I'm sure, as you all know, there's a common stereotype
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   that pastor's kids go one of two ways.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   They're either very good or terrible and rebellious.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   So if I told you that my brother was perhaps
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   the most innocent, mission trip volunteering,
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.280]   praise leader, goody two-shoes,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   you can easily guess where that puts me.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   So to be frank, I can truthfully admit
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   that I was not a Christian growing up.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   Oftentimes I would catch myself
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   leaning towards more agnostic beliefs,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   especially as I saw the sinful nature
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.280]   of the so-called Christians within the church.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   So to really put things into perspective,
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   I had to ask my dad, my pastor, my father,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.280]   whether or not I was even baptized.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   So apparently within the Presbyterian church,
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   once you're sprinkled as an infant,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   you eventually go through a confirmation process
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   at the ripe age of 18.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.280]   So I have zero recollection of going
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.280]   through that confirmation process,
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   so this really has to be the epitome
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.280]   of going through the motions to appease my parents,
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   who, of course, I love very much and respect.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   So I'm actually someone who, unfortunately,
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   always learns the hard way,
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   and it was only until the very recent year of 2019
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   that I went through personal hardships
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   beyond what I could have imagined,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   whatever happened to me.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   So I've always thought of myself as tough,
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   as a tough, resilient person
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   who could not really be easily broken,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   but I was proven very wrong.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   So lying alone in the hospital bed of the emergency room
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   on multiple occasions really reminded me
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   how fragile life can be,
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   and honestly, up until that point,
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   I was extremely comfortable constantly giving
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   into my personal vices without a second thought.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   So ultimately, this was due to the fact
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   that I was never essentially penalized
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.280]   for my moral behavior,
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   I essentially became habitual,
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   and once again, ultimately,
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   my sense of morality and faith in God quickly diminished.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.280]   So hitting rock bottom made me realize
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   how insufficient I am on my own,
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   and I've since accepted Christ into my life
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   to be my Lord and Savior.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.280]   I was essentially able to recover by His grace,
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   and I was healed mentally, physically,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   emotionally, and spiritually by admitting my weaknesses
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   and confessing my sins before God.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   However, the primary and most important difference
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   this time around was that I found Christ for myself
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   and not solely to appease my family.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   I'm very grateful to have taken the chance
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   to come out to Borrean Community Church.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   For once, I can say that I'm surrounded
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   by a genuine community of Christ-loving individuals,
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   and even after such a short time at the church,
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   I definitely feel supported by my fellow brothers
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   and sisters in Christ,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   as well as the excellent leadership team at this church.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   I just want to thank everyone here for your patience,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   as my walk with Christ is still relatively new,
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   and I will undoubtedly stumble here and there.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   So thank you for joining me today
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   on such a huge milestone in my life,
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   and hopefully this time around I can actually remember it.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   Thanks.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   [applause]
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.280]   [laughter]
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   [applause]
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   All right. Thank you, Enoch.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.280]   And we'll clean that up later.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   [laughter]
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   to Ephesians 3, verse 14,
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   and on.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.280]   Jump into part 2
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   of the message that we started last week,
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   and kind of preparing us for
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   our vision
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   and our focus coming into this new year.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   Hope and pray.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   Last year it was watch and pray,
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   and this year we want to focus on our hope,
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.280]   which leads us to pray.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   So Ephesians 3, verse 14-21,
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   NASV says,
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   [reading]
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   [reading]
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   [reading]
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   [reading]
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.280]   [reading]
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   [reading]
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   [reading]
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   [reading]
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   Let's pray.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would protect this pulpit,
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.280]   protect this church,
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   that whatever goes forth would only be your thoughts
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   and your words.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   I pray that you would prepare our hearts, Lord God,
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   to receive a blessing from you,
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   and that our hearts may continue to be transformed,
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   that our lives may be conformed
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.280]   to what you desire of us.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   May your name be magnified this morning, in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   Most church historians will agree
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   that before a church falls,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   or maybe even a generation of churches falls,
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   there's two things that get sucked out of the church.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   The first is the Word of God,
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.280]   that we begin to stray from the Word of God,
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   and we use our own moral compass
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   as a determination of what is right and wrong.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   What bothers me, what doesn't bother me,
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   is based upon what I think.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   And so the Word of God begins to get
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   drained out of the church.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   And then the second thing that gets neglected is prayer.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   And when you have a church that begins to neglect the Word,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   and it begins to run the church based upon
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   what each generation and each church, each pastor thinks is right,
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   according to his vision, his thoughts,
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   then that's the first step that you see
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   before the church becomes a nominal church,
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.280]   where it has a form of godliness with no power.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   But then the second thing that it begins to drain itself of is prayer.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   Prayer just becomes a word,
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.280]   it just becomes an afterthought,
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   we sprinkle on the things that we do,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.280]   and it is not a passionate pursuit that we have in prayer.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   So, from the very beginning of our church,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   we wanted to make sure that we do not neglect the Word of God.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   That's why we named our church Parian.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   We wanted to make sure that the Word of God is at the center.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   So there are certain things that I may say that may offend you,
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   but we're trying to be faithful to the Word of God.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   My litmus test of what should be said and not be said
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   is not does it offend you or not offend you.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   Is it biblical? Is it not biblical?
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   And so we've been doing that for the last 25 years
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   that we've been in existence in the church,
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   and so we're kind of, you know,
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   some of you have chosen to be at our church for that reason.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   But the second part of neglecting prayer
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   is just as important as the first.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.280]   It is not any lesser important.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   As long as we have the Word,
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   the prayer is something that we ought to work on.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.280]   Prayer is just as important.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   As detrimental as it is to neglect the Word of God,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   it is equally detrimental to neglect prayer.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:16.280]   And so this is something that we recognize in our church,
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   and we've been recognizing for years and years,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   and we want to continue to emphasize this,
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   that we want to make sure that the Word of God is lifted up
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   and that we are committed and devoted to prayer,
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   not just to pray, but to be devoted to pray.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   You know, I am by no means an example of a prayer warrior,
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   and I want to be, but, you know, that's my honest confession.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   And so I want myself and I want our church
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   to continue to move toward that direction.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   But what I am thankful for is very early on in my faith,
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   I was surrounded by prayer warriors.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   The ministry that I got saved in a long time ago in the early '80s,
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   they weren't known for their word.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   In fact, I can't remember too many things that I learned from that ministry,
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   but one thing that I did know is that they were committed to praying.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:16.280]   So every Friday night from 10 to somewhere around 1 to 2 in the morning,
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   every Friday night, teenagers gathered together in L.A.,
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   and we would pray, and sometimes you would sleep overnight
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   and then go witnessing in the morning,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   but the whole ministry was just about prayer.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.280]   They had a separate prayer school where all through the week
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   people would come and learn how to pray and continue to pray,
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   take us up to the mountains to pray.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   And so I'm very thankful that I was around people who were older than me
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   who were really committed to praying.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   I remember a particular missionary when I was at Biola who was in furlough,
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   and he was waiting and being trained to be sent back out,
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   and he would fast 30 days every single year.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   If somebody told me that, I'd say, "Oh, that sounds like church history,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   somewhere down the--I actually knew this guy."
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   And every year he would just shrink, and we would see him.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   We would know he was fasting because we would literally shrink.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   And so for two weeks he would just kind of attend class and do everything normally,
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   and then the last two weeks he would go up to the mountains
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   and then spend the other time praying.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   And he would do this every year, and I knew him for about four years.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   And so it was challenging to see him so committed to fasting.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   And years later, before Bill Bright--some of you guys may know who Bill Bright is.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   He's the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ,
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   and we happened to be at a conference where Bill Bright was there.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.280]   And so a few of the younger pastors, about 30 or 40 of us,
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   we were in a room and were able to meet with him
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.280]   and pick his brain about ministry and various things.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   And I remember in his latter years of ministry, he was committed to fasting.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   And so he was pleading with us, with the younger generation pastors,
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   and telling us that you guys need to pick up fasting.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   That after all the things that he has done to establish campus ministries
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   and share the gospel, he said, "Above all," he said,
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   "you have to commit to praying, in particular to fasting."
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   All the people that I've known--and I could probably pull a lot more
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   than what I'm saying, but I remember this--
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   two missionaries that I ended up going to China with when I first went.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   I think it was 1993.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.280]   We were touring China for about a month,
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   and these two missionaries, they would never come out to breakfast.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   So I thought, "Maybe they're being lazy.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Maybe they slept late and then they just skipped breakfast
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   and then they're going to come out for lunch."
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   And it took me about a week to realize that they weren't skipping breakfast.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   They were fasting.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   And so every breakfast, they would stay in and have their time with the Lord
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   and pray, and this one particular lady named Amy--
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   she was a bit older than I was--and then I was able to get to know her,
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   and then every opportunity I had, I was trying to pick her brain
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.280]   because I could tell she was communing with God so intimately,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   just constantly praying and fasting.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   And I remember very vividly this passing statement that she made to me
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.280]   because we would sit together while we were traveling to various places
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   and I would ask her about her prayer life because I see how important this was to her.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.280]   And I remember she said, like, after spending some time praying together,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   she said, "You know, every time you pray, you're always praying for protection."
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   And he said, "Not that there's anything wrong with that,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   but do you know who you're praying to?"
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   And then she said, "Our prayer should be a prayer for victory,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   not a prayer of fear."
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   And I remember she just said that in passing because there's a lady
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   who was so committed to praying,
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.280]   and she made a deep impression.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   She's like, "That's so true."
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   I'm so concerned about my circumstance that I don't realize who I'm praying to,
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   and my prayers reflect me more than it reflects him.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   But all the people that I can remember in my life that I could say,
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   "Those people were prayer warriors,"
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   the first thing that comes to mind was they were all humble people,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   every single one of them.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   They weren't showy. They weren't telling us.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   I would have never known that they were fasting in the morning.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   I just caught them.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   They never told us this is what they were doing.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   Every day, they were--in fact, I thought they were just being lazy.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   They're not waking up.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   And they were humble people. That's the first thing I remember.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   There was a love for Christ that you can't really describe.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   You can say, "Well, they love the Word, and they love evangelism,
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   and they did this and they did that."
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   But there was something about their affection for Christ
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   that's intangible.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   And it's not like I couldn't have conversations about trivial things.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   We would talk about various things in the culture and the food that we were eating,
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   and we were in a different city and in almost every city.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   But every trivial conversation that we had,
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.280]   we would almost always end up talking about Christ.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   And it's not because they had some sort of plan.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.280]   It was just that's what's always in their heart.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.280]   Just like somebody who's an avid Lakers fan, you know what I mean?
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   And you see it. They wear Lakers socks, Lakers underwear.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   I mean, they're just committed to this.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   And whenever you have a conversation, it eventually ends up going to talk about Lakers
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   or Dodgers or whatever it is that you're a fanatic of.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   And you could tell that every single one of these people that I remember
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.280]   is that they had this love for Christ that is just infectious, being around them.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.280]   But every single one of them were all driven people.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   You would think they're humble, they love Christ, that they just kind of, you know,
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.280]   like everything is good, nothing bothers them.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.280]   In fact, of all the people that I know, they were the most driven.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   They were so fixated on not only for what they had, but to spread the gospel,
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   to have as many people come to love Christ as they love Christ.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   And so their life was lived very intentionally, purposefully,
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   and headed either toward missions or discipling somebody.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   But every opportunity they had, they had a clear purpose, and they were very driven people.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   Now, I say all of this because I'm very thankful that God gave me these people
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:28.280]   that are even just in my memory, that this is why prayer is so important.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.280]   And I remember every conversation that I had with them,
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   I came away thinking that I heard a really good sermon.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.280]   And it's not because they said something articulate or they exposited the text better than somebody else.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   It was just that there was this nearness to Christ that was infectious.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   And I kind of think about when Moses came back from meeting God
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   and his glory was shining off of his face, and people knew immediately,
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.280]   because of the glory shining off of them, that Moses was with God.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   And it created fear because the glory was so powerful.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   And that's what I remember about them, that there are certain things that I would not say,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   certain things that I would not do in their presence because I just,
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   it just made me think like I was closer to God when I was with them.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   Prayer is just as essential.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.280]   When we focus on the Word of God without humbling ourselves before the Lord in prayer,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:31.280]   the Word of God becomes knowledge.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.280]   And when you have a man or a woman who's not humble before God
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.280]   and you fill that man with knowledge, immediately it turns into pride.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.280]   And when the pride fills a man, the next step is judgment.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.280]   That's almost always, that's the route that it goes.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   So it's not that the Word of God is not important,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   but when the Word of God is not coupled with humility and desperateness before God,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.280]   it almost always turns into pride and judgment.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.280]   And so all the more why, as a church, we emphasize the Word of God,
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   where we absolutely must be devoted to prayer.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.280]   We need to come before God. Last week it says, "For this reason,"
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   and the reason that we talked about was three chapters of explaining
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   the living hope that we have in Christ.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   That we have the whole purpose of why you and I are gathered here together,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.280]   is because we have this access to God that we couldn't have because of the blood of Christ.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.280]   So if the whole purpose is to have the door open, to have a living hope in God,
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   the next, obviously, is then come.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   And so he says, "For this reason, we need to pray,"
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   and then the manner in which we pray says, "to bow our knees before Him,"
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.280]   to surrender ourselves to Him.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   That no one can come to God in communion who has not surrendered himself.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   That as much as He is our Savior, He is our Lord, He is also our King.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   And so it says, "For this reason, we ought to pray, bowing our knees."
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   And then this morning I want to highlight three aspects of why we need to pray,
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   the source of prayer, the means of prayer, and the goal of prayer.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   And so, basically, that's going to be the outline of this morning, those three points.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   And before I jump in, I want to emphasize this,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   because the Trinity is highlighted in this text in prayer.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   The source of our prayer is God the Father.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   The means of prayer is the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   And then the goal of prayer is Jesus Christ.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   So you can clearly see the work of the Holy Spirit in the call to pray.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   Now, whenever you see all three persons of the Trinity that is engaged in something particular,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   we're supposed to take a step back and realize this is important.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   Not to say that if there's a mention of Christ and the work that He's done,
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.280]   that that independently isn't important,
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   or the power that we receive because of the Holy Spirit,
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   that that in and of itself somehow is not important,
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   or the work of God the Father who initiated His love and was shown us mercy.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   Independently is just as important.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   But when you see all three elements coming together,
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   you know that this is something that we ought to pay very close attention to.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:26.280]   Where God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son are actively working together
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   to call us to this activity, which is to pray.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   So the first thing that we want to look at is God the Father as the source.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   And the first thing that He says in verse 15 is,
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   "From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name."
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   And the reason why He mentions that in the call to prayer
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.280]   is to recognize that that's exactly where we come from.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.280]   That's who we are.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   So the whole purpose of why salvation was given to us
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   so that we may be restored back to why He created us in the first place,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   that we may be His image bearers.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   And that's basically what He is saying.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   As I mentioned to you a couple weeks ago, we adopted two cats.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   I didn't.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   My kids did. My wife did.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:15.280]   And so therefore, I did.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.280]   And one of the things that I observed that's interesting to me is that these cats,
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.280]   because they came to us as kittens,
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   they weren't properly trained.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.280]   They weren't discipled to be cats.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   They were born as cats.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   And so one thing that's interesting to me is the way they play
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   and what's interesting to watch is,
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   even though they never watched this,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   they didn't have older cats to show them this is what they're supposed to do,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   whenever they play, they play like they're catching a mouse.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   So they would hunker down and then put the pressure on their back legs,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.280]   and then they would jump up into the sky, and then they would pounce.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   And I said, "Oh, if you're going to catch mice, that's exactly what you would need to do."
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   But it's interesting that they never watched any other cats do that.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.280]   They just did that instinctively.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   So they have cat-like reflexes because they're cats.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   Because they're created that way.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   So their vision, their senses, their legs, their muscle distribution,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.280]   all of that was created for a particular purpose.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   So I look at that and they're playing, and they're kind of playing the role of what a cat normally does,
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   because obviously they're house pets.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   Now I use that as an example because when cats do that,
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   they're instinctively doing what they were created to do.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   See, the Bible says that you and I have been created to become image-bearers of Christ.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.280]   But because of our sin, we fell away from God,
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.280]   we're trying to figure out, and everybody is doing what they think is right in their own eyes,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   and every year we have this question, "What do I want? What would I like to do?"
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   And so we live our lives based upon what brings the greatest pleasure to us,
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   and in this pursuit of our own pleasure and meaning, we are condemned and we are lost.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   At the end of our lives, we come to the same conclusion that Solomon did.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Empty, empty. Meaningless, meaningless.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   And every generation tries to prove the previous generation wrong,
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   but every generation only confirms what they've said for thousands of years.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   Empty, empty. At the end of all your pursuit, empty, empty. All is empty.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   Vanity, vanity. All is vanity.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   And that's why he's saying, he's recognizing the Father who calls us to come to Him,
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.280]   He's the one who created us.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   But secondly, he says that He would grant you according to the riches of His glory.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   According to the riches of His glory.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:08.280]   It reveals to us that the Father who calls us to pray, to come to Him, is not playing hide and seek.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   He's eager according to the riches of His glory.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.280]   Jesus shares that in the story of the three parables.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   When He talks about, in the Gospel of Luke, where you have the first one where the sheep goes astray,
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   and that one of the hundred, and he goes out, spending all his energy bringing him back, bringing the sheep back,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.280]   and they celebrate. The second one is the coin that's lost, and the lady sweeps the whole house, finds it in celebration.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   But the real point is the third one, the prodigal son, where the father is eagerly waiting for this repentant son to come back.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   And instead of saying, you know what, you blew all this money, and you were disrespectful,
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.280]   now you go out and feed the pigs, and you earn yourself way back.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   Instead, Jesus paints a picture of God the Father eagerly waiting for His son.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.280]   And as soon as He sees His son on the horizon, He runs out to him, puts on the robe,
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   and the slippers, and He welcomes him back into the house.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   That's how Jesus painted the picture of God the Father.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   That He is rich in glory. He's not simply saying, well, try your best, and then if you earn your way to Me,
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   then I'll answer your prayers. He says it's according to His riches in glory.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.280]   Ephesians 1, 7-8, it says, "In Him we have redemption through His blood, forgiveness of trespasses,
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us in all wisdom and insight."
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   He didn't just give us grace. Grace in and of itself is receiving something that you and I did not deserve.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   But He said He didn't just give us grace. He said He lavished us with grace.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   According to the riches of His glory.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:13:00.280]   You ever wonder why the feeding of the 5,000, that there were 12 baskets left over?
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   Why did He leave 12 baskets left over? Because every one of those disciples had to carry that.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   If you study the description of the basket, it was not a small, tiny basket.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   It was a basket that went from the top of your shoulder all the way down to the ground.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   It was a pretty big basket. I can imagine the disciples thinking to themselves,
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.280]   "Why didn't Jesus just make just enough? Why all this waste?"
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   They have to carry this heavy thing around. Why did Jesus do that?
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   And then when He fed the 4,000, there were 7 baskets left over. Why does He do that?
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   There are some of you who invite people over for dinner, and you don't know how to cook for 5 people.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   You leave enough for maybe 10 families.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.280]   Some of you guys, if you're in charge of the food, there's always abundance left over.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.280]   It's like, "Well, this is kind of waste. Let's make sure that we have enough, but not a waste."
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.280]   Why did Jesus do that? Is it because He couldn't calculate?
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   Everything Jesus does is for a purpose.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:09.280]   And so even in His miracle of feeding them, every single one of those disciples who carried them
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:15.280]   was a reminder to them, "This is how God answers our prayers. This is who He is.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   He doesn't just want to feed us abundantly beyond. He lavishes us with His grace and His mercy.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   This is who He is. Ephesians 3 verse 8, it says,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.280]   "To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.280]   the unfathomable riches of Christ."
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:42.280]   So the gospel isn't simply that you deserve judgment, but Jesus forgave you.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:48.280]   See, that would be grace. That would be mercy. That in and of itself would be worth celebrating the rest of our lives.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.280]   But He made us co-heirs with Christ.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.280]   We are adopted children calling Him our Abba Father.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   That we're going to rule with Him in eternity. The Holy Spirit has been embedded in us.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   So He says, He's not just talking about grace. He's talking about unfathomable riches of Christ.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   He said He was called to teach them this.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.280]   John chapter 15 verse 7, it says,
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:21.280]   "If my word abideth in you and your word abideth in me, ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   The picture that is painted for us of our God is a God who is eagerly desiring for us to come to Him
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:34.280]   so He can answer our prayers. He wants to answer our prayers.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.280]   He says, Psalm 37 verse 4, "Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart."
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   This is who our God is. He's not playing hide and seek and saying,
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   "If you just earn, if you just do this better, maybe I'll give you this."
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   Our God in His richness and mercy, who lavished His love toward us,
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   is eager to give us when we delight in the Lord.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:08.280]   You know, when we don't recognize who He is, it affects the way that we live our lives.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   You know, with all the things that's been going on around us,
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   you know, economic and the gas prices have been going up.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   You know who doesn't complain about gas prices? Billionaires.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   Mark Zuckerberg doesn't complain every time he sees the 3, 4, 5 cents tick up.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.280]   "What? I gotta pay $4.50?"
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   I'm pretty sure the billionaire is just like, "Oh, okay."
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.280]   He hears the chatter, but it doesn't bother him. It doesn't bother him because he's a billionaire.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   Billionaires are not as bothered by the change of circumstances, the economic turn,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   because they have all this money. It's not going to make a dent in their life.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.280]   See, when Christians don't understand the richness that we have in Christ,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   every little change of circumstances, every little turn, every little opinion of other people,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   it shakes our foundation. And we have to go after change.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.280]   "Why are you doing this? How come you're doing that?"
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.280]   We're concerned and we're living like we're in poverty.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   See, when somebody is poor, they're constantly, every little turn, every little cent,
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   every little thing that they can't save or everything that they lose, it bothers them to the core.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.280]   But he says, "No, we are rich in Him."
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:32.280]   A rich person, a genuinely rich person, isn't as concerned whether people see them as rich or poor.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   Because they have all this money. Only people who are trying to show off their wealth
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   are people who aren't really rich. The really rich people don't need to prove anything.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   When we are rich in Christ, we're not as concerned about our reputation and what other people think,
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   because I am secure in Him. Everything that I need for life of godliness, I have in Him.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:18:00.280]   So your opinion, as much as I want, doesn't matter. It doesn't shake my foundation.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.280]   But you know what else changes? The rich people, when they walk into a room,
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   their first thought is not, "What you can give me?"
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   "What can I do? What kind of relationship I can build? What can I get?"
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.280]   Because he's a billionaire.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   I mean, even if you're wealthy, you might have a couple hundred thousand a year or 300,000 a year.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.280]   I don't know how much you make.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   But a billionaire doesn't walk into the room thinking, "How can I tap into that?"
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   Because he's a billionaire.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   When he walks into a room, he may be thinking, "What do these people need? How can I help them?"
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.280]   See, when we're not rich in Christ, and we forget what it is that we have in Him,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.280]   every human being becomes an opportunity. "What am I going to—what do I benefit from this person?"
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:47.280]   And we choose churches based upon, "What are they doing for me? What am I going to get?"
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.280]   And so when I don't get, even when we give, we give hoping that that will somehow return back to me.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.280]   It's an investment.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:05.280]   But when we're rich in Christ, every opportunity is an opportunity to express my gratitude for the riches that I have with Him.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   And so it's important for us to recognize who it is that's calling us.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   So when we're not praying to Him, when we're not communing with Him, we live in spiritual poverty.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.280]   Even though we have this fat bank account.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:25.280]   Even though we have all the resources that we can possibly imagine, but we live as practical atheists.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:32.280]   We're poor, always looking for somebody else to give me what I want.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   God is our resource, who's rich in mercy, lavished His grace on us. He's the one who calls us.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   Number two, the means.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.280]   God the Holy Spirit is the means for our prayer.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.280]   That's why we receive the power.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:54.280]   So when the Bible says that at the end times, there's going to be people who have a form of godliness and yet without power.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   He's describing people who are living according to the Word, like the Pharisees, but they do not know God.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   So there's no power.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:14.280]   A church that studies the Word, memorizes the Word, reads a lot of books, and knows all the theology, and yet is not devoted, devoted to prayer,
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.280]   is exactly what they're talking about.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.280]   Form of godliness, there's no power.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.280]   See it says, verse 16b, "To be strengthened with power through the Holy Spirit in the inner man."
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   It requires power.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:38.280]   What Jesus was doing physically, He said, the Holy Spirit will do in spirit.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.280]   See the disciples were always concerned that as long as they were with Jesus, they were safe.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.280]   Because Jesus was their answer.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   Jesus was the answer to their enemies.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.280]   Jesus was the answer to their hunger.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.280]   Jesus was the answer to the storms.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   But as He was going, they were being nervous.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   Like, if you leave, what's going to happen?
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   And that's when He says, the Holy Spirit's going to come.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   And He's going to teach you. He's going to guide you.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   Everything that you were relying on Me, you're going to rely on the Holy Spirit.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.280]   In Romans chapter 8, 26-27, it says, "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weakness.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   The Holy Spirit has been deposited in us.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   There's not a single Christian who does not have the Holy Spirit.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   But He says the Holy Spirit has been deposited in us in order for the Holy Spirit, in His power, to intercede on our behalf.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   So we say, well, if He's interceding and He's already groaning for us, why do we need to pray?
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   The Holy Spirit's already doing that.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.280]   Well, look what He says here.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   "For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us."
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.280]   In other words, He's talking to an individual who is praying, but is having a hard time praying.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.280]   He said the Holy Spirit is going to be there to help us.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   He's not telling us, He's like, oh, you have the Holy Spirit, just kind of relax, get on the boat, and the Holy Spirit is just going to guide you through.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.280]   He said He empowers who? Those who pray.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   When did the Holy Spirit come? In the book of Acts.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   When they were gathered and praying.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.280]   They weren't just walking around and having fellowship and communion, and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit came.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:36.280]   They were eagerly waiting, and they were eagerly praying when the Holy Spirit came, like fire.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   It was in prayer that they received this power.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:46.280]   Ephesians 4.30, He said, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.280]   When we think about grieving, we normally think about sin.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.280]   We're doing things, or watching things that we shouldn't watch, and that also is grieving of the Holy Spirit.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:01.280]   But I think the most common way that we grieve the Holy Spirit is simply not praying.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   Because the Holy Spirit has been deposited in us to lead us to Him, and we're not moving.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280]   We're not cooperating.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:17.280]   And so, if you've ever tried to train a child, the most frustrating thing is they just don't listen.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:24.280]   And I think the most common way that Christians grieve the Holy Spirit is simply by neglect.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:31.280]   See, not only does He tell us to pray, because the means in which we communion with God is the Holy Spirit.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:35.280]   The means in which we communion with the Holy Spirit is prayer.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.280]   Ephesians 5.18, He said, "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation."
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.280]   Dissipation is another word to say it's disgusting.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   You know how you get drunk with wine?
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.280]   You drink too much wine.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.280]   Do you know how you get sober?
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.280]   Don't do it.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   Right?
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.280]   You don't need to do anything to stay sober.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.280]   You just need to not do things that make you drunk.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:04.280]   And so here, He's talking about to stay sober, to not to get drunk.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.280]   How do we get drunk?
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:12.280]   When we are saturated by the things of this world, we get drunk by the things of this world.
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   Just like if you drink too much, it affects your reasoning, it affects your outlook, it affects your personality.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.280]   It affects what comes out of your mouth.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:26.280]   It affects who you are and how you see things.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.280]   Because you're being influenced by what's outside.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.280]   So when He says, "Do not get drunk with wine," He's not simply talking about wine.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:40.280]   He's talking about being drunk with anything that causes us not to be sober in Christ.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:48.280]   If we are filling our minds, and even though you say, "Oh, you know, it's just a movie. It's just this. It's just that."
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:57.280]   But when our mind and heart is filled with the things of this world, whether you know it or not, you are drunk with the world.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   And it affects your paradigm of what is good and what is bad.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.280]   What is sin and not sin.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.280]   You know, after a while, if you've been sinning the same thing over and over again,
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   you know what begins to happen is, we start, instead of calling it sin, we call it a mistake.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.280]   And then from mistake, we go through struggle.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.280]   And then from struggle, it just becomes common.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280]   Everybody struggles. This is what people struggle with.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.280]   And anytime somebody points that out, it's like, "Oh, you're a legalist."
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:35.280]   So we went from struggling with sin to defending the sin because we've become drunk.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   See, the Holy Spirit convicts us of this.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   To drive us to Him. He intercedes. Why is He groaning? What is He groaning about?
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   To bring us to Him. To get us to pray. To commune with Him.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.280]   Without the Holy Spirit, our inner being never changes.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.280]   And I think, recently in our generation, we've had people who are bearing so much fruit externally,
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:04.280]   but after they pass, their private life is exposed and realized that their inner being was so corrupt.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.280]   I think, without even mentioning anybody's name, I think you know who I'm talking about.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   They weren't the first one, and they won't be the last.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   Where people have paid all their attention on the external qualities,
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.280]   while their inner being was never paid attention to.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.280]   In fact, Jesus is the first one who says that. He calls the Pharisees.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.280]   You're like what? Dead man's tomb.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.280]   Where you dress up all the stuff on the outside, but inwardly, it's still a tomb.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.280]   Where you have dead bones.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.280]   And that's exactly what He's talking about. Where we have the appearance of godliness,
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   there's no power.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.280]   Because the power comes from abiding in Christ.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   By the work of the Holy Spirit.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   By groaning and devoting ourselves to the resource that causes the inner person to change.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.280]   That's why if you look at all the qualities, the fruit of the Holy Spirit,
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.280]   are inward qualities of gentleness, joy, kindness, patience.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280]   All of it are inner qualities.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   It doesn't simply say discipline, external hard work.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   All these things are out products of it.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:15.280]   But the inner quality of patience, gentleness, love.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.280]   These are inner things that the Holy Spirit convicts us of and transforms us of.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.280]   So that it's not just external things, but internal things that change.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280]   And that's exactly what Jesus said.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.280]   It's not what you put into a man, corrupts him.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.280]   It's what comes out.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:34.280]   So the work of the Holy Spirit when we pray is to convict us of our inner being.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   So that what happens externally is simply a by-product of the ministry of the Holy Spirit inside of us.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.280]   And that's exactly what Paul says in Colossians 1.29.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.280]   "For this purpose also I labor, striving according to his power."
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   Not my power, but his power, "which mightily works within me."
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.280]   Paul's not laboring hard because he's more disciplined than other people.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280]   He's more educated. He's more determined than others.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.280]   He says the Holy Spirit was working in him.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.280]   Not by his power, but by God's power.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:13.280]   And then third and finally, God the Son, Jesus Christ, is the goal of our prayer.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.280]   Verse 17, "So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith."
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.280]   "And that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints,"
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.280]   "what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ,"
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.280]   "which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God."
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:39.280]   Did you notice here in these three verses how he mentions to the utter nth degree?
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.280]   He's not just saying so that you would recognize who Jesus is.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.280]   He's not simply saying so that you could believe in Jesus.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   So that you can be transformed from a child of the devil to a child of God.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.280]   He doesn't say that.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.280]   It's way beyond that.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.280]   To make Christ dwell in your heart.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:06.280]   The word for dwell here is not simply talking about a guest that's coming to your house.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.280]   The dwell here is to make a home.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.280]   To make a home.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:17.280]   You know, whenever we invite guests to our houses, we have to go clean up everything.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.280]   Except our closet in our main bedroom.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.280]   You're not allowed to go there.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.280]   So there's parts of the house you can go to, parts that you cannot.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   But whenever they come, we clean up.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.280]   But if they come live with us, just simple cleaning is not going to do.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.280]   You have to prepare.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.280]   Or they're going to see how you really are before you prepare.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.280]   So many people are reluctant to invite Christ into their home.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.280]   They bring Christ into their home as a guest.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:53.280]   As welcomed on Sunday, but go back to your house on Monday.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.280]   Jesus says that Christ may dwell, make a home in your home.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.280]   That He's making a permanent dwelling.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.280]   He's living with us.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:10.280]   We can't ask for revival if we don't want Christ to come dwell with us.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:17.280]   Revival isn't simply feeling passionate, singing louder, and the church is growing, and doing more evangelism.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:23.280]   Revival is to invite the presence of God into our intimate homes.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.280]   Where we dwell Monday through Sunday.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.280]   Every single day.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280]   That's what He means.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   That He was praying that Christ would make a dwelling in our home.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.280]   And being rooted and grounded in love.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.280]   Rooted. It's not simply talking about a plant that you can move anywhere.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.280]   When something is rooted, that it's independently growing.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.280]   It's planted there.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   So He's saying to make a dwelling, to make your home, to root it and ground it.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.280]   Again, He's saying the same thing again.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.280]   That Christ would make a permanent home.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.280]   And may be able to comprehend with all the saints.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.280]   Not just that God loves you.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:10.280]   But what is the breadth, and the length, and the height, and the depth of the love of Christ.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:14.280]   Not just to say, you know what, I appreciate what Jesus has done.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.280]   And we participate in communion, we sing some songs.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.280]   He said, no.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:24.280]   You understand the depth, the height, the width, and the length of the love of Christ.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   That it's not just grace, it's just lavish grace that He bestowed upon us.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:36.280]   And then He says, and to know the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   Beyond what I can just tell you.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.280]   It surpasses knowledge.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.280]   Corrie Tamboon.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   Many of you guys know who she is.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   She survived the Holocaust, became a Christian, became an evangelist.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.280]   And I remember hearing her testimony saying how she needed to sell watches in order to make a living.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   And she would say every time she would sell a watch to a person.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   And she would walk away feeling somewhat guilty.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.280]   Because she'd say, what if the watch breaks down?
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.280]   What if it doesn't live up to the hype?
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   And she always came away from the sale thinking that maybe I hyped it up too much.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.280]   And then she became an evangelist, sharing the gospel and the love of Christ to people.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:21.280]   And she'd say, after she would preach the gospel and share about the richness of Christ.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:25.280]   She would walk away thinking, did I do Him justice?
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   That no matter how hard she worked to explain the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   She always came out thinking that maybe I didn't do it justice.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   That's what he means by to comprehend with all the saints.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.280]   The surpassing knowledge of Christ.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.280]   The love of Christ which surpasses knowledge.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:54.280]   How do you embrace and understand the love of Christ that surpasses beyond knowledge?
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.280]   It's not simply something that you can read.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.280]   It's not simply from exposition, from hearing a sermon.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.280]   It's when we encounter this God.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:12.280]   See, as much as I would say, well it's a hyperbole, it's an exaggeration.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   But it's a reality when you actually meet Christ.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:22.280]   As much as I want to explain to you and describe to you.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:28.280]   Nothing will do it justice until you yourself meet Christ.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   Some days I might do a good job, some days I might do a bad job.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   But no matter how good of a job that I do.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.280]   You will always leave this room knowing that you meeting Christ.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.280]   Isn't going to do justice of anything that I've said.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.280]   And so he says, in this passage that surpasses knowledge.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:53.280]   That you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.280]   All the fullness of God.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   Not simply to taste Him, not simply to observe Him.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.280]   Not simply to praise Him.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   But the fullness of Him.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.280]   To consume by Him.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.280]   Again, you and I live in a generation that even just going to church.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:12.280]   And becoming a member in a church.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.280]   Going to Bible study every week.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.280]   Makes you a serious Christian in our generation.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.280]   But that's where the deception lies.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:26.280]   Because we automatically think because we're doing more than the people around us.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.280]   That we're good.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.280]   But Paul's prayer and the desire of the Holy Spirit.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:36.280]   Groaning inside of us, interceding on our behalf.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.280]   Is so that we may become fanatics of Christ.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.280]   Where the world looks at us and say, man these people are strange.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.280]   They're weird.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:54.280]   In fact, the previous generation they would call people who are on fire for Christ, Jesus freaks.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   And for those who are passionately pursuing Christ as a compliment.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.280]   I must have been doing something right because they see that I'm weird.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   But for whatever reason, our generation has become a derogatory term even in the church.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.280]   We want to love Jesus. We want to follow Jesus.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.280]   But we don't want to be freaks.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   But that's exactly what he was praying for.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.280]   That we would be infatuated with Christ.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:30.280]   And the reason why he wants us to be infatuated with Christ is because that's where life is.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   Everything else that draws us away from God, that hinders us from God, is going to drain that life away from us.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   So to be infatuated with Christ is to be infatuated with life.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   To be infatuated with Christ is to be infatuated with hope.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.280]   Not just to casually follow him, but to have him with all our might.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   And that word here, to comprehend. To comprehend this love, is not simply mental understanding.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.280]   Because in John chapter 1 verse 5, it says, "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it."
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:11.280]   He's not talking about comprehending like it didn't make sense to them.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   The word comprehend means to go toward and to attain. To strive after.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   And that's what he means in 1 Corinthians 9 24, "Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?"
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   Run in such a way that you may win.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:33.280]   To win. Not just to say, "I got a number."
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:38.280]   I could sign up for a marathon.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   It would be a big joke, because no one has ever seen me run.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:46.280]   But I could sign up for the marathon, because I just need to pay.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.280]   And they're going to give me a number.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   And I put the number on, just casually.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.280]   And I could tell you that I'm in the race.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.280]   But the difference is, I don't care if I win.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   So whether it takes me 2 hours, or 14 days, it doesn't matter.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.280]   So if I'm not trying to win, it doesn't matter what kind of shoes I wear.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.280]   It doesn't matter what kind of pants I wear.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.280]   It doesn't matter if anything is hindering me, because hindering me from what?
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   Nothing is hindering me from being in the race.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.280]   It is hindering me from winning the race.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.280]   And that's the difference. He's not just simply calling us to sign up for the race.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   He's calling us to win.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   To have the fullness of Christ. All of it.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.280]   He didn't just give us life so that you can taste the goodness of God.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.280]   He wants us to come to His banqueting table.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.280]   That's what Paul, in Philippians 3, verse 12, says,
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.280]   "Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect,
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:54.280]   but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which I also was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:00.280]   In other words, the whole reason why Christ took hold of me, is so that I can take hold of Him.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   As much as He lavished His love upon me, that I could comprehend this with all the other saints,
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:12.280]   and then to strive after Him with all my might, so that I may be consumed with Christ.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   Infatuated with Christ.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.280]   I want to know everything about Christ.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   I want to know Him in the morning. I want to know Him in the afternoon.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   I want His name to be ringing in my head when I go to sleep.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   I want Him to be my refuge. I want Him to be the source of my joy.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:36.280]   I want Him to be the one that I'm waiting for.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   I want to eagerly wait to die so that I can meet Him face to face.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   To be infatuated with the fullness of Christ, that you cannot have anywhere else but with Him.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.280]   This is why we need to pray.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:59.280]   This is why we need to come and meet Him.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   You can talk about how great He is. You can describe the riches of Him.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   But until you meet Him yourself, it's not the same.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.280]   Reading a book about somebody and meeting Him is not the same.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   That's why He concludes with His benediction in verse 20.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.280]   He says, "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think,
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   according to the power that works within me.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:32.280]   To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all the generation forever and ever. Amen."
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:38.280]   Far beyond what you and I could possibly imagine, He says to come.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:46.280]   Imagine if I told you that each one of us has access to nuclear power.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   The first thing that would happen is a sense of fear.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   Because if you handle this wrong, you're going to die.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   But the second thought that you may have is, if I have this access to this nuclear power,
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   what would you do with this power?
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   Next time I go camping, I don't have to worry about electricity.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   I have nuclear power.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.280]   You don't ever have to worry about your phone dying because you've got nuclear power.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.280]   You don't have to worry about the electricity bill at home because you have nuclear power.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:26.280]   This solar, I mean, it's a joke. You've got nuclear power.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:32.280]   But how trivial would it be if that's all you thought?
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:38.280]   How we would miss the point if that's all the application you can think of?
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   If I had nuclear power, wouldn't you think because of the magnitude of this power,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.280]   there are nations, people who are starving, whose countries don't have electricity,
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   where you can almost wipe out poverty if you can give them access to this power.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:06.280]   We wouldn't simply think of camping and heating and our phones.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:14.280]   And yet, so much of our prayer is about protection when we travel,
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.280]   to become healthy if we get sick,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:23.280]   to find a good job when economically we struggle,
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.280]   to have better relationships.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.280]   So much of our prayer and our concerns are wrapped up in trivial things.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   Not that God doesn't care. He said he counts every hair on our head.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   But if that's all we're concerned about.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   In Psalm 2-8 it says, "Ask of me and I will surely give you nations as your inheritance,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   and the very ends of the earth as your possession."
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:00.280]   That prayer and that invitation is appropriate and it is fitting for the one who is calling us to pray.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:07.280]   Even nuclear power is trivial in light of who it is that we have access to.
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   And so every time we see Apostle Paul praying, he doesn't pray for health.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   He's a human being like us. He's concerned like anybody else.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.280]   He wants to avoid pain like anybody else.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   He's in prison praying for the salvation of the guards.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.280]   He's concerned about the churches outside, asking, telling them,
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   "I have found the secret of being content in every and all situation."
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   He is praying that whether he is in chains or whether he is outside,
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:44.280]   his greatest concern is that the nations would come to Christ.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   He understood what he had.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   And that's why his prayers reflected it. He prayed for nations.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   I want to end this sermon with a confession.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.280]   Our church has been growing faster than ever before.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.280]   And so the common concern that I hear from members who have been at our church for a while,
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   especially even with our pastoral staff, is, "How are we going to handle this?"
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.280]   Do we have enough building?
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.280]   Thank God that we are able to purchase that building. We have some more space.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.280]   And it's like, "Well, the space in which we're growing, we're going to have to need that building."
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   And then say, "Well, once we get that, is that going to be enough?
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.280]   And what are we going to do if we double and triple in size?"
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   Do we have enough pastoral staff?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.280]   Do we have enough small group leaders? Do we have enough space?
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   You know, there's wrestling with that and praying about that and thinking,
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:47.280]   "How trivial my anxiety to come before the God of the universe and say,
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:54.280]   'If He makes it grow, will He provide what's needed for that?'"
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.280]   I've taken my eyes off of Him and realizing, "Just do what I tell you to do.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.280]   And if it triples, let God handle whatever is needed for that.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.280]   Let Him handle it and trust Him."
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:11.280]   But I share this with you because I think many of you can relate.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.280]   That if I give my full to Him, what if?
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.280]   If I give my all to Him, what if?
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.280]   If I surrender everything to Him, what if?
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:33.280]   And so, we pray to an Almighty God while we hang on to our bank accounts
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   and all our safety nets and make sure all that is in place
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:44.280]   because in the back of our mind, maybe we've forgotten who He is
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   or our faith is too small.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:54.280]   This Friday, when we come to prayer, I want to encourage you to come to prayer prepared.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.280]   Typically, if you're not careful, you just come neglecting the whole week and say,
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   "Well, at least Friday I'm going to go pray."
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.280]   The best way to pray corporately is to pray privately.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.280]   Those who pray privately are going to have the best time praying corporately.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.280]   There is a special power in the presence of the gathering of the church.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.280]   That's why we gather.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.280]   And I know some of you are going to be online, but even if you're going to be online,
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.280]   prepare yourself.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.280]   If you have sense to confess, don't wait until Friday.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.280]   Confess it tonight.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.280]   Confess it today.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   Prepare yourself to meet the Almighty God who is rich in His mercy,
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   who has lavished on us everything that we need for a life of godliness to come together.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.280]   Make a list of things to pray for.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.280]   Make a list of things that these are things that I'm going to petition before God
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:48.280]   and to come together to pray, to pray, pray, pray.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.280]   We have hope.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:57.280]   We have hope in Christ, so it only makes sense that we devote ourselves to pray.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:07.280]   So I hope and pray that this coming year that we would make significant strides toward that direction.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   And I say this because, honestly, I haven't led you well in this direction.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:19.280]   I've been pounding about the necessity of the word for so many years,
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.280]   and I have given sermons about prayer.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.280]   We've had prayer meetings and the importance of prayer,
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:35.280]   but honest confession, in comparing to how important this is, I don't think I've led you well.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:41.280]   I want you to see what Christ showed me.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   I want you to know Him, not just to observe Him, not just to describe Him.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:59.280]   I want you to know Jesus, because I know that if you meet the Christ that I met,
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:08.280]   if you see the Jesus that I saw, you would want to follow Him with all your might too.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   You wouldn't be as easily distracted by this world.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:19.280]   You would want to spend all your life to tell other people about Christ.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.280]   And it's not enough just to study.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.280]   We have to humble ourselves before the Lord, seek Him with all our heart,
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.280]   together to comprehend the richness that we have in Christ,
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:37.280]   that we may be filled with all things of Christ.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:46.280]   Let's pray.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   Heavenly Father, Lord, Your mercy and grace is beyond comprehension.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:48:05.280]   Lord, we thank You for calling us, allowing us to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   If we've relied on our circumstance, on our previous knowledge, experience, study,
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:22.280]   and yet we feel so distant from You, help us, Lord God, this week, this year,
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   to be devoted in prayer, knowing who You are that calls us,
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:37.280]   to be able to be engaged in the power of the Holy Spirit, to sanctify our inner being,
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:44.280]   that our eyes may be opened, Lord God, that true knowledge of Christ is beyond knowledge,
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:50.280]   the height, the width, the depth, and the length of the love of Christ,
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.280]   that we would not simply have the name of Christian,
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:58.280]   that we will be followers with all our might.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   May Christ be exalted. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.280]   Would you all stand up with us for closing praise?
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:26.280]   [piano music]
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   Give me a prayer, let my prayer be a cry
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   Humble my heart so that You may draw nigh
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:55.280]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:05.280]   Cause me to be one who's set free
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   To stand as a house of prayer
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:31.280]   Oh, house of prayer
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:41.280]   Make us a prayer, let our prayers be a cry
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:50.280]   Humble our hearts so that You may draw nigh
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:10.280]   Cause us to be a people set free
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:20.280]   To stand as a house of prayer
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   Oh, as a house of prayer
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:45.280]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   Cause us to be a people set free
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   To stand as a house of prayer
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.280]   Nice work.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:22.280]   Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:26.280]   than we can imagine, beyond all that we ask or think,
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:30.280]   according to the power that works within us,
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.280]   to Him be the glory in the church
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.280]   and in Christ Jesus to all the generations,
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:41.280]   forever and ever. Amen.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:46.280]   God sent His Son
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:51.280]   They called Him Jesus
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:53:01.280]   He came to love, heal and forgive
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:11.280]   He lived and died to buy my pardon
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:21.280]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:41.280]   Because He lives, all fear is gone
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:51.280]   Because I know He holds the future
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:54:02.280]   And life is worth the living just because He lives
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:10.280]   Amen.
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:17.280]   It is good to praise the Lord
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:24.280]   It is good to gaze upon His majesty
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:30.280]   To proclaim His love in the morning
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:37.280]   And His faithfulness in the evening
