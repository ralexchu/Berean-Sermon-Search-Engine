[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   The new book on the Definite Atonement is out from Crossway, titled "From Heaven He
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.360]   Came and Sought Her." You contributed a chapter to the book, Pastor John, and some
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.800]   initial reviews are starting to pop up online, and I know you read some of them.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.840]   Any initial responses to the book reviews that you've read so far? I've
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.440]   read some of these interviews, I mean these reviews, Tony, and this morning I
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.320]   was reading in 1 John a very common verse opposing definite atonement or
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.800]   limited atonement, and so I thought I'd throw together these two, my thoughts
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.160]   from my devotions and my response to some of these reviews like this. My main
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.360]   response is to encourage people, everybody who's listening to this,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.720]   anybody who reads the book, reads the Bible, reads the review, whenever you hear
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.960]   somebody make a comment about the death of Christ, be sure that you ask, "What do
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.520]   you think that means?" In other words, if somebody says, "Jesus died for all people,"
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.680]   fine. I'm not going to disagree with that until I ask, "What do you think that
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.080]   means?" So when you're in an argument or a conversation with somebody about the
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.840]   extent or the effectiveness of the atonement, don't smash each other
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.520]   with slogans. It's useless just to keep saying, "He did die for everybody. He
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   didn't die for everybody. He did die for everybody. He didn't die for everybody." Well that's just
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.120]   useless. You've got to stop and say, "What do you mean when you say He died for
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.440]   everybody?" The controversy around this doctrine, it seems to me, perhaps more
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   than any other, starts spinning its wheels on the ice, getting nowhere,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.760]   because people are quoting verses to each other without asking, "Now what do
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.000]   you think that means?" So for example, I was listening to my father
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   preach last Sunday. He's been in heaven for six years, and I've got numerous
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   recordings of his preaching. I love to listen to my dad preach. So he's
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.200]   preaching a sermon called "The Secrets of Spiritual Power." My wife and I are
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520]   listening at a bed-and-breakfast where we were celebrating our 45th wedding
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.000]   anniversary, and he suddenly stopped and said, "Do you believe Jesus died for
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.080]   everyone? Aren't you glad Jesus died for everyone?" I just loved it, and we looked
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.800]   at each other, and well, I looked at each other. The next thing out of his mouth was
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.920]   this, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.680]   believeth in Him should not perish but have Him." So immediately I know exactly
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.480]   what my father's thinking. He's thinking, "Jesus died for everyone in the sense
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.080]   that everyone who believes will be saved," which is exactly what I believe, and my
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   father wouldn't have called himself Calvinist, and he wouldn't have
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.960]   called himself a believer in definite atonement, but at that point, at that
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.360]   point, my father tipped his hand perfectly, just as he ought to, what he
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   meant by the term "He died for everyone." He quoted John 3:16, "For God so loved the
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.120]   world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes..." So what's the
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.040]   meaning then of his statement? The meaning of his statement is, "Christ died
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.160]   for everyone such that everyone who believes will be saved." It's clear as day,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.880]   and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that statement, nothing unbiblical
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.720]   about it. John 3:16 means what it says, and we ought to believe that Jesus died
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.880]   for all in that sense, and I think, Tony, that's what 99% of the people in the
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   world who say Jesus died for everyone mean by it. So the question isn't whether
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.120]   that's true or not, the question is, "Did He do more than die so that everyone who
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.200]   believes may experience the benefits of His death?" Because the answer to that is
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.320]   clearly everyone who believes will experience the benefits of His death. Did
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.880]   He do more than that? And that's where my devotions come in from this morning. I
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.040]   was reading in 1 John 2, and I read this sentence, "He is the propitiation," Jesus
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   is the propitiation, that is, the one who removes the wrath of God, who assuages
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.480]   the wrath of God, who absorbs the condemnation that God is going to pour
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.600]   out on sin, unto destruction. "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.760]   ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." Now that's a verse
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.880]   that is usually quoted back to those like me who believe in definite atonement
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.760]   or limited atonement, say, "See, He's not only the propitiation for our sins, but
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.560]   for the sins of the whole world." So He removed the wrath of the whole world. And
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.040]   I think I should just stop at that point and say, "Okay, let's just pause here. I
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.480]   want to make sure I understand what you believe that means. I hear the words, I
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   want to know what you think it means. What are you saying when
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.760]   you quote that at me? What do you think it means?" Now, here's what I think it
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.840]   means, and I'm just amazed at how John helps us here, because in his gospel, in
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.360]   his epistle, and in the book of Revelation, all written by John, he
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.840]   addresses the same issue in words that are similar to help us not
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.000]   misunderstand what he means. So if you go to John 11, 51, and 52, where he's
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.960]   addressing the same issue of the death of Jesus and the extent of it, here's
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.480]   what Caiaphas, who's speaking prophetically, says, and John reports it,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.240]   "Jesus will not die for the nation only," that is, the Jews only, "but also," now just
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.760]   pause there and hear the similarity. So 1 John 2, 2, "He's the propitiation not for
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:33.520]   ours only," our sins only, "but also," and here in John 11, 52, "He will die not for
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.680]   the nation only, but also," and then instead of saying "for the whole world" or
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.400]   whatever, he says, "but so that he would gather into one the children of God
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.800]   scattered abroad." So not for the nation only will he die, he will die to gather
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:59.120]   into one the children of God that are scattered abroad. Now that means the
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   death of Jesus procures, obtains, gathers in, receives, accomplishes the
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.600]   ingathering of God's elect, the scattered children of God all over the
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.360]   world. So I think that would be the natural way to take 1 John 2, that when
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.680]   it says he died notâ€”he was the propitiation not for our sins only, but
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.640]   for the sins of the whole world, he means the world is included here. This is not a
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.760]   private religion, he didn't just deal with us, he is dealing with the whole
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.200]   world, and he's gathering people into Christianity from the whole world, and
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.280]   he's blessing the whole world by obtaining people from every tribe and
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.040]   tongue and people and language, which is exactly what Revelation, the third text,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.520]   5-9 says. You were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.480]   every tribe and people and nation. So he ransomed them from, he's gathering
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.360]   the children of God from by the death of Jesus, which means there is something
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.320]   more God does in the death of Christ than simply making it possible for
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:18.400]   everybody to believe, a la John 3.16. Rather, it says he is actually effectively
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.720]   purchasing them from the tribes, and he's gathering them like children
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   from the tribes, and so it's not only our little precious gospel, it is a gospel
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.160]   for the whole world. Now the point of all that, Tony, is just to say this,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:43.520]   when people read reviews, when they read the controversy, be sure to ask, "What do
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:50.000]   you mean when you say Jesus died for all?" Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
