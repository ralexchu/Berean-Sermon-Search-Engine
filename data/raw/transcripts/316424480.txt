[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 1, again I'm going to reread
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.680]   verses 1, 2, and 3 before we get started.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.320]   Again reading out of the NASB, "God, after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.840]   in many portions and in many ways in these last days, has spoken to us in his Son, whom
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.320]   he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640]   And he is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature and upholds
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.400]   all things by the word of his power.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.380]   When he had made purification of sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.380]   on high."
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.380]   Let's pray.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.500]   Christ the loving Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.000]   We pray, Father God, that what you've intended in the book of Hebrews, Lord, that you would
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160]   allow it to bear fruit in our hearts as we listen, as we study, as we dig.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.000]   Help us, Lord God, that the more we know, the more we will apply in our lives.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.220]   So bless this morning, we know, Father God, that no matter how well I exposit this text,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.800]   I pray, Father God, that without your Holy Spirit's conviction, it's just man's words.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.960]   And so we pray, Father, that you would illuminate us, cause us to see your heart and your mind,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.160]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.600]   Most of you probably will not remember this commercial, but those of you who do, see if
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240]   you can finish this phrase.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.320]   When E.F. Hutton speaks, everyone...
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.120]   Yeah, you have to be a certain age to remember this commercial.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.680]   This was back in the late 70s and early 80s.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.240]   There was a commercial from a brokerage, E.F.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.760]   Hutton Brokerage, and basically the commercial says, "When E.F.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.080]   Hutton speaks, everyone listens."
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.760]   So if you're of certain age, I mean, that commercial was very popular, right?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.000]   That was a catchphrase.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   When E.F. Hutton...
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.640]   It was so popular that it started being used in different circles, like, "When someone
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360]   speaks, everyone listens," right?
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   And the reason why the commercial was popular, basically it was about this brokerage, and
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.880]   when E.F. Hutton speaks, the information that he's giving out is so valuable that everyone
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.600]   stops what they're doing, and they lean over to hear, so they maybe get some stock tips
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.120]   or what's going on in the economy.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.480]   Who you listen to is probably dictating what you value and where you're headed.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.880]   And that's why in Psalm chapter 1, it begins by saying, "Blessed is the man who does not
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.640]   listen to the counsel of the wicked."
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.560]   Because if you are listening, if you're leaning your ear toward the counsel of the wicked,
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.240]   that's the advice that you're getting.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.620]   Those are the things that you value, and those are the things that you will eventually end
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620]   up pursuing.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.160]   So the question this morning is, who do you listen to?
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.400]   Now, I know this morning that you're listening to me in the sermon, but there's a difference
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   between hearing the sermon and listening to the sermon.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   You know the distinction.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.400]   Someone who is listening is somebody who is attentive to and be eager to hear the advice,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.240]   and then they'll apply it.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.520]   Where you're leaning over, you're not just casually hearing the words that are coming
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.720]   out of someone's mouth, but you're leaning, saying, "Oh, what is this?
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.760]   These are valuable things."
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   I thought about people in my life that I listen to.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.320]   Obviously, the elders and the leaders and the pastors in the church, we spend a lot
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   of time and we throw ideas and we kind of share our thoughts and theology.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.600]   And so whatever happens in that meeting, they tend to have my ear.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.000]   I would say the person that I probably listen to more than anybody else is probably my wife.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   And the reason why, obviously, she's my wife, but she never nags.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.220]   She's not a nagger.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.540]   So she rarely says anything negative, at least not to me.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.120]   And so every once in a while, she might say something.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.240]   She said, "Did you...you know, you and you said that?"
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   And you could tell she's kind of reluctant to say because she doesn't want me to respond
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   negatively.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.380]   She has my ear because it's very rare that she says something.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.280]   So if she says something, I know she has a lot of thought, and it was very important
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.440]   to her.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.600]   So she has a tendency, whatever she says, I tend to listen to her more than anybody
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.240]   else.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   The author of the book of Hebrews is beginning this letter by basically saying, "Listen."
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   Remember last week I told you that the author is basically going down the list saying, "Jesus
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.440]   is better than the angels.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.880]   Jesus is better than Moses."
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.080]   And he's going down the list of important beings and people in the life of Israel and
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.440]   say, "Jesus is above all of that."
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.720]   And that's basically the theme of the whole book of Hebrews.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.120]   But even before he gets to the angels, he begins by saying, "Jesus is better than the
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   prophets."
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.920]   And the reason why he begins the letter by saying that is to get them to listen.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   Because you're listening to partial information, scattered information, progressive information
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.920]   from the book, from prophets of the Old Testament.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.240]   But the clear communication is coming through Jesus.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:36.040]   So basically what he begins by saying is, "Listen to Jesus."
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.600]   There's five things that I want to highlight in this text, why he's trying to motivate
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   them.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.380]   So in the end, the end conclusion of everything he says in these three verses is, you need
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.700]   to listen to him.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.240]   You might be listening to the scribes.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.800]   You might be listening to your neighbors.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   Maybe those who are persecuting you.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.000]   Maybe the rabbis in your synagogue.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.360]   And so many people have your ear.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.600]   And maybe some of them in their life is saying, "Why are you making your life so hard?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   All you have to do is just embrace some of Christianity and embrace some of your old
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.880]   life and you can enjoy God and enjoy the world at the same time.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.760]   Why are you making it so hard saying it's Jesus or nothing?"
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.780]   So again, the author of the book of Hebrews is basically saying, "Those voices you need
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.320]   to drown out because the one who has authority over your life is speaking."
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.360]   So he begins the letter by saying, "Listen to Jesus."
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.280]   So every one of these points is the reason why they need to listen to Jesus.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.960]   Number one, Jesus is greater than the prophets because he is the son and not just the messenger.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.080]   He said, "Long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions, many ways in these
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.780]   last days has spoken to us in his son."
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.040]   The prophets were simply messengers.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.180]   But now Jesus, God is speaking directly through his son.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.360]   It says in comparison to what Jesus is saying versus what the prophets were saying.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.560]   He says, "They spoke in many portions and in many ways."
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.840]   When it says in many portions, basically what he means by that is when God communicated
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.660]   through the prophets, he gave it progressively in bits and pieces.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.020]   So we have pictures of the gospel in the Old Testament.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.020]   We have pictures of his suffering.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.800]   We have pictures and types of Jesus' resurrection and death and suffering and atonement.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   But it came in bits and pieces.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.520]   You don't have the clear and complete presence of the gospel in one prophet.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.360]   It's progressive in the span of hundreds and maybe even thousands of years of God revealing
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   himself.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.920]   He says it came in bits and pieces.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.260]   But now in Jesus, he's putting it all together.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.880]   So why would you listen solely to the prophets?
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:10.180]   Again not to say that any of that was wrong, but it came progressively in bits and pieces.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.120]   Not only did it come in bits and pieces, it says it came in many ways.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.480]   Some spoke clearly.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.640]   Some of them was illustrated.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.720]   Some prophets were told to be naked on one side for a while and then go naked the other
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.560]   side for a while just to show them that God was angry with them.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.360]   Some of the Old Testament is written in poetry.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.840]   Some of it written in narrative.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.300]   Some of it in prophecy.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.560]   But they all came in many different forms.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.960]   And the reason why he was doing that was everything that he was doing was dropping hints.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.540]   And all of it collectively pointed to Christ.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.320]   So let me give you an example how to best understand the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.800]   Like what we know of the kingdom and God from the Old Testament and New Testament.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.880]   Now some of you, all of us, at some point, like I mean if you're married or if you're
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:20.240]   dating, like let's say as a guy if you have interest in somebody you start dropping hints.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.840]   Or some of you girls do that with the guys, you drop hints.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:32.360]   I remember when I had interest in Esther, there were little things that I did that I
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.400]   would not do for anybody else.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.560]   It would be raining outside and I would make sure that she's not wet.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   And this is before I've ever had any kind of conversation with her.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.200]   And there would be a crowd of people standing at the door and I happened to be the only
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   one with an umbrella and I would come and I would get her and get her to the car.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.680]   And I would come back and then I would take other people but she was the first one that
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   I took.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   Now obviously that was, I was hoping that she would notice that.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.080]   She didn't notice it.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.680]   But I was dropping little hints.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.520]   I was in charge of a ministry and she was in charge of the sisters ministry and I remember,
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:17.360]   I forget if it was their birthday or whatever it was and I got her a little bunny eraser.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.680]   Anyway there's a story behind that.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.960]   I remember I gave it to her, she's so dense.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.040]   She didn't get any of it, she didn't pick up any of it.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.240]   But I was dropping hints and then finally when I heard that she was moving to the east
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.480]   coast to go to pharmacy school, I thought I need to make this clear.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.400]   And so when it was time for me to make it clear, basically I took all the things that
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.680]   I've done and said okay, now that was kind of a set up for me so that when I came and
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:56.320]   told her that she would have some idea, that she was expecting me to come and clarify.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.400]   When the time came for me to talk to her, I was dropping hints for a year and a half,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.080]   at least in my mind.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.700]   She caught none of it.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.880]   So by the time I was trying to clarify, she was shocked.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.600]   Like where did this come from?
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.200]   And I remember thinking like, how did you not know?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.400]   The reason why I share that is because in the Old Testament, God was dropping hints.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.680]   In every way, if you were paying attention to what God was doing in the Old Testament,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.880]   in bits and pieces, in many forms, you look at that and say, now we look back and it is
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.320]   clearly God was speaking about the coming of Christ and His suffering and our salvation.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.880]   But in the Old Testament, it was coming in different forms, in many pieces, progressively
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.520]   throughout time.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.040]   But when Christ came, He basically DTR'd with us.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.420]   As a son, He came and He made it clear.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.560]   You know what happened in Leviticus?
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560]   That was me.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.600]   Remember Israel wandering in the desert and then they are entering into the promised land?
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.960]   That's all talking about salvation going into eternity.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:12.920]   And He begins to explain through clear words, everything that God was doing in the Old Testament
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.640]   in dropping hints that He's coming.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.160]   And what was all that for?
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.560]   For anticipation, as a set up, as a foundation for Jesus to come and say, now let me make
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.120]   this clear.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.720]   So He begins the letter by saying the prophets were telling you in bits and pieces, in many
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.240]   different forms, but now Jesus comes as the Son.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.080]   And so in other words, what's the point that He's trying to make?
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.680]   Listen to Him.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.040]   It wouldn't make sense that you would go from this clear teaching of Christ and going back
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.200]   to illustrations and stories and hints.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.480]   So when it says, the author says that He comes as the Son, there's two things that he mentions.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.440]   One, because He is the Son, He's able to speak clearly.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.160]   In Matthew 13, 16, 17 it says, "But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.260]   ears because they hear.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.960]   For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desire to see what you see,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.520]   and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.280]   Even as the prophets were dropping hints and God was giving them progressive revelation,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.000]   what is this?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.040]   You're saying that the Messiah is going to come and suffer and He's going to save us?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   Who is this?
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.200]   When is this going to happen?
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.440]   And they long to hear it, but they never heard it.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.760]   He's talking about Himself.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.440]   They wanted to hear the clear message.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.400]   They desired it.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   But because He was the Son, He was able to make it clear.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.920]   1 Corinthians 2, 11-12, "For who among men knows the thoughts of man except the spirit
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.340]   of man which is in him?
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.120]   Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.680]   Now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.280]   that we may know the things freely given to us by God."
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.880]   Think about how often people want to hear from God.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.000]   What is the Lord's will?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   What does God want from my family?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.480]   Does He want me to do this or do that?
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.600]   And yet never spend any minute studying the clear words of Christ.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.840]   They want to know the will of God.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.400]   They want to have a relationship with God.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.360]   They want to know His thoughts and His purpose in my life.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.360]   They want to understand if God loves them or not.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.560]   And yet the clear teaching of God's word from His own mouth is written in the scripture
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.120]   and yet they never pay attention to what it has to say.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.000]   No wonder, no wonder your view of God is so ambiguous.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.320]   No wonder God seems so distant and far.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.360]   It's almost kind of like you're in a room and you have friends and you never talk to
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.680]   that person and you're always wondering.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.360]   You know I have no idea what they're thinking.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.000]   I wonder what they're thinking.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.960]   I wonder what they're thinking.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   It's so hard to know what they're thinking.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.600]   Well why don't you ask?
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.120]   Why don't you go out and have lunch?
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.800]   Why don't you sit there and just ask?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   What are you thinking?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.960]   Have a conversation with that person.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:26.440]   So much of our ambiguity and our fuzziness about what we know of God is simply because
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.820]   we're not going to the source.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.040]   So first and foremost He says the prophets came in many different portions in many ways
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.840]   but Jesus comes as His son so He speaks clearly.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:43.640]   Secondly, He speaks with authority because He speaks as His son.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.800]   All this time He said you've been listening to a messenger.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.080]   Now the person who is the source of the message has come.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:57.240]   Matthew 7, 28-29 when Jesus had finished these words the crowds were amazed at His teaching
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.720]   for He was teaching them as one having authority not as their scribes.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   Jesus wasn't simply conveying a message.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.000]   I heard this and now you need to know this.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.040]   He said He's the son.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.240]   He comes with authority.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.560]   He's not simply saying I'm conveying to you what I heard.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.160]   That's why He's able to say in Matthew 5, 27-28 you have heard it said that it was said
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.600]   you shall not commit adultery.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.840]   Now that's the Bible He's quoting.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.360]   You said He said you have heard it said that you shall not commit adultery but I say to
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.800]   you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.080]   with her in his heart.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.200]   Now if anybody else said this that would be blasphemy.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.520]   Not because what He said was wrong but because He said you have heard it said you've read
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:57.840]   the Bible and the Bible said this but I say to you there's only one person in this universe
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.480]   that can say this and get away with it.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:09.360]   Nobody, no pastor, no scribe, not even an angel of God can come and say the Bible says
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.880]   this but I say to you.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.600]   Nobody can say that.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.480]   The only person that can say that is the one who said this.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   He comes with authority.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.680]   He said I say to you.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.960]   In other words He's clarifying what His Father said.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.120]   He says it again in Matthew 5 33-34 again you have heard it said that in the ancients
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.360]   were told you should not make false vows but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord but I
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:44.440]   say to you make no oath at all either by heaven for it is the throne of God.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.800]   In other words enough of your vows.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   He says not to not only that you should make false vows but even when you do make vows
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.240]   you don't keep it.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.880]   I mean that's the experience that God had with the nation of Israel.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.600]   Who can say this but God Himself?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.960]   So He comes with authority and over and over again Matthew 5 38-39 you have heard it said
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:16.160]   and I for an eye, tooth for a tooth but I say to you do not resist an evil person.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.520]   No wonder the scribes had such a hard time with this because only God Himself would have
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.080]   authority to say these words and that's exactly who Jesus was.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.360]   He was God Himself.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.400]   So the end conclusion of the first point is you've been hearing through the ambassadors
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.480]   now the president has come.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.320]   You've been hearing through, you've been hearing through secretaries, through the generals
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.280]   and these were all very important people but now the president has come.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.960]   Hear it from the horse's mouth.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.720]   If there was any ambiguity, any question about God's intent now Jesus is making it clear.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.200]   Secondly Jesus is greater than the prophets because Jesus' words were final.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.660]   He says in the last days.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.800]   Everything that was happening through the prophets were progressively leading up to
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.360]   this point but when Jesus comes there's nothing beyond Him.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   It's finished.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   That's why He says the last days.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:24.200]   So last days is not talking about a few days in the past but the last period of redemptive
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.160]   history.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.280]   Everything that God intended and was preparing for was leading up to the last days, the coming
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.520]   of Christ, His death and resurrection and now the period of the church we're all living
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   in the last days.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.040]   That's why the scripture says in 2 Peter 1 3, His divine power has granted to us everything
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.480]   pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   There's nothing more for us to wait for.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.400]   Everything that God intended for our salvation, forgiveness of sins, for our resurrection
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.440]   has been given.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.220]   There's nothing more for us to wait for.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.240]   So Jesus is greater than the prophets because His words are final.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.440]   Thirdly Jesus is greater than the prophets because He is not simply a mediator but the
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.000]   source itself.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.320]   Hebrews 1 2, Whom He appointed heir of all things through whom also He made the world.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.780]   He is God Himself, the heir of all things, the creator.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:29.840]   It says He is the radiance of His glory and exact representation of His nature.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.140]   You know what's a great illustration of the Trinity and oftentimes when you hear people
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:41.040]   like illustrate the Trinity, there's no exact illustration because when you try to say this
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.120]   is what it's like, you end up becoming either a modalist or tritheist.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.560]   You get it wrong on either end.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.360]   Now if you don't know those terms, don't worry about it.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.480]   But I do encourage you to know it at some point.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.840]   Basically modalism is one God presented in three different ways.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:07.040]   Just like I'm a father, I'm a pastor, I'm a son, I'm a husband, and so one person but
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.720]   have different functions in different arenas of life.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.920]   That's called modalism.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.440]   But the Bible doesn't present Jesus as just one God just kind of showing three different
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.820]   ways of who He is.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.920]   And then if you're not careful, you go to the other end, tritheism.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.520]   Tritheism basically is you have Father who is distinct by Himself and you have the Son
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.720]   who is distinct by Himself and then you have the Trinity or the Holy Spirit by Himself.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:44.000]   But it's kind of like in my family, you have all Kims but you have the Father, right?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.680]   You have the Mother and then you have one of my children, right?
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   But we're all Kims.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.560]   So in the same way, you have God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, all three
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:01.120]   are distinct and they're all Gods but there are three distinct and that's called tritheism.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.400]   Other ones are not biblical.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.960]   That's not how it's presented.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:13.880]   The Bible says that there's only one God in essence but three distinct.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.680]   One times one times one equals one.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.840]   That's the formula for Trinity.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.680]   It's not one plus one plus one equals three, right?
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.840]   So if that's gone over your head, you know, take some time, right?
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.720]   Because this is the first thing I really struggled with as a young Christian because I could
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.960]   not understand Trinity and I thought maybe it was because I'm biblically illiterate and
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.720]   if I learned more that I would somehow get it.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.160]   And so I would go and ask my professors, my Bible study leaders and I was so intent on
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.120]   finding this out because this is a God that I've given my life to follow and I can't explain
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.980]   Him.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:56.240]   And so I was stuck on this for years to the point where my Bible study leader basically
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:04.160]   told me to knock it off because every Bible study eventually led to I don't get this.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.720]   I've asked you, obviously you know the Bible way more than I do and I've asked all of my
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.080]   professors and they have PhDs in this and even then I was like maybe I'm just dumb.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.140]   I just don't get it, right?
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:22.920]   And then I began to study the scriptures from verse to verse to verse and I started realizing,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.780]   oh, it does teach this.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.060]   Even though I can't explain it, it teaches the Trinity.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:33.980]   And so the conclusion that I came to was if you believe the Bible is authoritative and
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:41.380]   is from God, whether I understand it or not, it's true.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.260]   But if I don't believe it, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean that it's
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.780]   not authoritative, right?
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.860]   Now all of that is to set up for this.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:57.940]   Jesus, and I thought this was one of the best illustrations because it says Jesus is the
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.180]   radiance of God's glory, exact representation of his nature.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.940]   So Jesus is not a part of God.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.100]   Jesus is not just a figure of God or an image of God.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.580]   He says he is the radiance of his glory.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.940]   When God reveals himself, what do you see?
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.940]   Jesus.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.780]   That's what it means.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.000]   He is the radiance of God's glory.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.700]   So those are not two separate things.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.700]   You understand?
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:30.720]   When he says he's the exact representation of his nature, he's not talking about an image
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.900]   of George Washington or somebody on a coin where his image was imprinted on him, but
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.040]   the very person is completely different.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.140]   That's not what he means by that.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:47.180]   It says his very nature is exactly represented in Christ.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:54.500]   So in other words, just the very words that he uses here is referring to the Trinity.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.260]   And I think this is the best illustration.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:03.780]   When we look at the sun, what are we seeing?
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.340]   The rays, right?
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.300]   That's coming from the sun.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.900]   We see the light coming from the sun, right?
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:18.940]   So basically we are seeing the sun, but we are seeing the radiance coming from the sun.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.100]   So if you've seen the rays from the sun, you've seen the sun.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.700]   But here's the distinction.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:32.500]   They say that it takes about eight minutes for that light to travel to here.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.600]   Eight minutes.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:46.960]   So when we gaze at the sun, what we are looking at is the sun eight minutes ago.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.900]   Because it took eight minutes for that to come into our sight.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.100]   That's how far the sun is.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   So when we see the sun, we are looking at the sun, but it's distinctly different because
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.740]   it's eight minutes after the rays were given.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.380]   Now if you're confused a little bit, you kind of get it, and you're still a bit confused,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.220]   then you got the Trinity.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.980]   Because when we look at the radiance of God's glory, we are looking at the Father, but it's
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   distinct.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.580]   It is not exact at that time.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.140]   And that's how the Bible represents God.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.720]   It may not be a perfect illustration, but I thought that captures more than any other
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.540]   illustration that I found.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.320]   Jesus himself is the exact radiance, or radiance of his glory.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.000]   So when we see Jesus, he says we see him.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.740]   And that's what Jesus says in John chapter 14, 8-10.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.940]   Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.940]   Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know me,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.940]   Philip?
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.500]   Who has seen me has seen the Father.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.620]   How can you say, 'Show us the Father?'"
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.700]   Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, and the words that
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:13.020]   I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but the Father abiding in me does his works.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:21.460]   Now the point of all of this is to listen.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.380]   This is God himself speaking.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.340]   Now if you're in the market of trying to find out where you want to invest your money, and
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.580]   you have let's say a chunk of money, and you want to make sure that you pick the right
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.140]   stock, who would you listen to?
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.740]   Back in the 70s, it was E.F. Hutton.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.100]   Who would you listen to?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.940]   I hear stories about people paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars just
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.580]   to have dinner with Warren Buffet.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.900]   He's one of the most famous investors of our lifetime.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:59.260]   Become a billionaire just from picking the right stocks over 30, 40 years.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.060]   People are willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars just to hear his advice.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.380]   What stocks do you want me to choose, and what do you see coming?
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:14.220]   Because if you can do even half of what he did in his life, you would be a billionaire.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:21.600]   So if you're a basketball player, if Michael Jordan speaks, you listen.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:28.220]   If you're trying to set up a social media, when Mark Zuckerberg speaks, you listen.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:35.820]   Whatever it is that's valuable to you, you listen intentively because their advice is
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.180]   going to change the direction.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.540]   It's going to help you get to where you want to go.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.340]   So you get online, and if you're in business, you pay money.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.900]   Have to have consultants who are experts in these fields to get you to where you want
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.500]   to go.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:58.520]   But when it comes to your life, who else do you listen to?
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.300]   You don't listen to Warren Buffet about your marriage.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.680]   You don't go to Michael Jordan about raising children.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.680]   You don't go to a business expert to ask about computer failures.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.000]   You go to the right source.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.520]   So when it comes to your life, who else would you listen to than the author of life himself,
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.560]   the creator?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.640]   So again, the point of the third point is listen.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.840]   Fourthly, Jesus is greater than the prophets because he's the sustainer of all things.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   In other words, we ought to listen to him because he's the one who sustains.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.700]   He upholds all things by the word of his power.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:47.300]   The world does not run on its own.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.720]   Because we experience things in repetition.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.980]   I go to sleep, I wake up, I eat, go to the bathroom, take a shower, and so everything
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.760]   that we do, we do in repetition for a long period of time.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:03.480]   So anything that we do in repetition, we have a tendency to take for granted.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.780]   We're like that even with relationships.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.380]   Whenever it's new, it's new and exciting.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.740]   And when people have been in our life for a long period of time, we just assume they're
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.060]   going to be there until they're gone.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.500]   And all of a sudden, you realize how important they were.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.340]   And you begin to realize what a huge role they played in your life.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:27.560]   But anything that is done in repetition, we tend to take for granted.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.500]   The scripture says we are here because of him.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.100]   He sustains us.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.740]   You breathing, you coming week after week after week, you've been a Christian whether
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:46.060]   for a few months or for many years, it's because of his grace.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.860]   But when he says that he upholds all things, he's not simply talking about maintaining
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.980]   so make sure everything just keeps going and doesn't burn and crash.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.220]   He sustains, like a pilot sustains an airplane going into his direction.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.060]   It's not stagnant.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.900]   There's a clear goal of our life.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.360]   And Jesus Christ is directing that.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.940]   And that's what the Bible means when he says he sustains us.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.700]   He upholds all things.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.540]   Everything that God is intending for this, for the world and where it's headed in the
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.580]   book of Revelation, Jesus is sustaining all of that.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.860]   That's why when the scripture talks about we can't lose our salvation is because if
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:35.020]   you've been saved by the sovereign hands of Christ, he is sustaining us and he is making
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.860]   sure that we get to the end.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:44.220]   So the very reason why you and I year after year, despite some of our many failures, that
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:49.100]   we're able to be at church and listen to his word and we're not far gone is because Christ
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.380]   is making sure that we're getting to our destination.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.220]   There's a reason why we're on the airplane and the pilot comes on and he says, "Put on
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.980]   your seatbelt because we see turbulence coming."
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.660]   We don't sit in our chairs like, "Wow, I don't feel it."
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.780]   I don't trust him.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.480]   And you just unbuckle your seatbelt and you're just walking around, right?
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   You don't know what's coming.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.020]   If you've been on an airplane long enough, you know when the pilot says, "We see turbulence
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   coming," right?
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.260]   10 out of 10 times, there's some turbulence.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.980]   Now, the degree of turbulence may be different, right?
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.420]   I don't know about you, but I've been on airplanes where I was thrown out of my seat and almost
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.540]   hit the top of...
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.420]   Not the top of the airplane, but you know where the baggage thing was?
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.940]   It was that bad.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:41.700]   We were flying from Beijing to Urumqi and they said, "Hey, turbulence is coming."
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.420]   So we're just like, "Oh, it's going to be a little bit shaky."
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.620]   Well we thought the plane cracked because we were on the very back of the plane and
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.500]   they hit the turbulence and maybe people in the middle didn't feel it as much, but we
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.100]   were at the very tail end.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.500]   And when that thing snapped, anybody who didn't have their seatbelt on, we were almost flown
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.220]   out of our seats.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:06.660]   So now whenever I'm on an airplane, when the pilot says, "We have a little turbulence coming.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.500]   Please we advise you to keep your seatbelts on and don't go to the restroom right now.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.180]   And flight attendants, please have your seats and buckle up."
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:21.100]   I put that seatbelt on and I tighten it just in case, right?
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.620]   So the scripture says that he upholds all things.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.940]   He's upholding not just kind of on autopilot and let it be and let it get to our destination.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.420]   He says God is the one who's piloting us to our destination.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.740]   So in other words, what is he saying?
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.580]   Listen.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.220]   His words have consequences when he's warning us.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.060]   And so the warning that we hear in the book of Hebrews is you're going to drift if you're
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.020]   not anchored.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.860]   You're going to drift into danger if you don't pay attention.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.780]   If you neglect such a great salvation, how shall you escape this judgment?
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.340]   If you just allow yourself to continue to go down this path.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.220]   He says he's the one who upholds all things.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.100]   In other words, listen, pay very careful attention.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.580]   Fifth and finally, Jesus is greater than the prophets because he is the fulfillment of
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.620]   what God has spoken.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:20.180]   Not only is he the one who sustains, he's the destination itself.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:26.780]   The whole purpose of all of this is to bring us and to be reconciled to himself.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.500]   Hebrews 1.3, when he had made purification of sins, he sat down at the right hand of
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.260]   the majesty on high.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:39.340]   Jesus himself fulfilled what God desired, the salvation of mankind.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.740]   First Peter 1.10-11, as to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:49.260]   would come to you, made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.420]   time the spirit of Christ within them was indicating as he predicted the suffering of
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.860]   Christ and the glories to follow.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:01.740]   He said Christ was going to come and they were eagerly waiting.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   He's going to suffer, but his suffering is going to lead to glory.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.660]   And that's what they were waiting for.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:15.180]   For Christ to come and redeem us from our sins and to bring us to glory.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.580]   Everything that we experience here is temporary.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.020]   Especially those of you who are young.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:28.180]   You know, when you get older, our concern is losing what we have.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:33.420]   At this point in my life, you know, and again, not that that was ever a pursuit of my life,
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:42.780]   but even if it was, even if my wildest dreams came true, I became an NBA superstar, I created
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.220]   the next big technology, and I became the richest man on earth.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.740]   Even if your wildest dreams came true, it's temporary.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.900]   You hold onto it for a short period and then at some point you have to let it go.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.060]   It's temporary.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:03.180]   So when you get older, I think the temptation that older people have is losing what they
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.100]   have.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.180]   But when you're young, the temptation is that you're not going to have what you potentially
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.500]   can get.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.220]   So if you commit your life too early, if you sacrifice and you do these things and you
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.380]   don't come cornered, if you don't do these things, I may not be able to become a millionaire.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.120]   I may not be able to be successful.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:31.000]   So the temptation is not what you have, but what you may lose if you make certain decisions.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.880]   But in the end, even if your wildest dreams came true, every human being who has lived
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:47.720]   on this earth, no matter how successful they are, all they are now are names on paper.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.120]   They're in the grave like everybody else.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   They're no more richer than the poorest person that died at some point in history.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:01.520]   Whether you died of natural causes, whether you died young with disease and horrible life,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.880]   the end is the same.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.040]   Jesus Christ came to deliver us from that fate.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.280]   He's the end.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   He's our goal.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.880]   And he says Jesus Christ came to fulfill that.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.280]   All human history, God's intent and his love and his grace and his mercy is fulfilled in
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.480]   Christ.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.080]   In other words, what is he saying?
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.640]   Listen.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.880]   Who are you listening to?
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.080]   Whose advice do you covet?
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.480]   Who do you lean toward when they speak?
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:51.160]   If it isn't first and foremost the words of Christ, you're probably already drifting.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.640]   If you're casually listening to the words of Christ and intentively listening to the
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:02.960]   advice of the world, you probably have already been drifting.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:13.680]   When we're young, I noticed in being a father, the easiest time, physically it's hard, but
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.060]   when the children are young, it's easy because they listen to you.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.240]   Even the most rambunctious of kids, they listen to you.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.960]   I remember when my kids were young, they would fight with each other and then they would
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   say, "Oh, it's not this, no, it's that, that."
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.000]   Then I walk into the room, "Daddy, is this true?"
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.040]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.760]   End of the fight.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.680]   And he said, "So that's the truth."
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.940]   And then puberty hits.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:43.200]   And all of a sudden, they start testing you.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.320]   You said this, but my friends said, "Your friend's just like you.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   He's not any more than you.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.600]   Why is truth coming from your friends all of a sudden?"
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   And so they go through that stage where they're testing the world.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.800]   So you're no longer the source of truth when they get to that age.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.400]   And that's part of growing.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.200]   And so when they're teenagers, their advice oftentimes is coming from their peers.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.360]   It's more important what their peers think than what the parents think.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.360]   And they go through that stage.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.720]   And then you get older and you learn from that.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   It's like, "My peers, they're dummies.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.880]   This guy didn't know Jack."
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.160]   Then you see how some of their friends made some foolish choices in the direction that
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.720]   they went, and then you realize, "Maybe they're not the people I should be paying attention
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   to."
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.760]   And then you get to the next stage where you listen to your own passions.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.120]   It's like, "Well, this is what I want.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.400]   This is what I desire.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   I'm going to do this."
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.560]   And you get determined, and you begin to listen to yourself.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.040]   And that's when pride comes in.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:52.300]   And if you're successful, it gets harder because you think you know.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   But that's also a stage.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.680]   And it's a very dangerous stage because you begin to just follow whatever passions, whatever
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.900]   your flesh leads you.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.720]   And that's exactly what the scripture says.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.400]   Do not trust your heart.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.800]   It is very, very, very deceptive.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.880]   You can like one thing one day and hate it the next day.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.660]   If you live long enough, you know that.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.640]   Even your appetite changes as you grow up.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.020]   What you think is good and bad changes as you mature.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:27.160]   To have your whole trajectory based upon your passions is not simply a mistake.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.380]   It's dangerous.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:39.080]   But if we want to live, there's only one person that will give us what we need to live.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.440]   And that's the author of life.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.600]   So the point of all of this is to prepare us for what he's about to say.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.620]   He's about to go into this eight, nine chapters of Christology.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:59.240]   And he begins by saying, "Listen."
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.360]   You know what's interesting about the book of Hebrews?
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.880]   There is no introduction.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.240]   In every one of the letters in the New Testament, it says to the church of Colossae, to Philemon,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.480]   to whoever, and it'll say, "Apostle Paul or James."
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.800]   And it will give an introduction.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.080]   It says, "I'm thankful for you.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.680]   I'm praying for you."
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.440]   But there's two letters in the New Testament where it jumps right into the point.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.080]   The book of Galatians.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.360]   He says, "I, Paul, an apostle, write this to you."
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.120]   And then he jumps in, "I'm surprised that you're so easily turning to a different gospel."
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:36.480]   And then he jumps in because he's so concerned about these Judaizers who are corrupting the
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   church.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.280]   And anybody who preaches a different gospel other than what I preach to you, let it be
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   anathema.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.780]   And he says it twice.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.640]   And that's at the very beginning of the letter because there's a sense of urgency because
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.240]   they're drifting from the true gospel.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.480]   And we know that that was a very intense letter because he was very concerned.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.880]   And the other letter that doesn't have an introduction is this letter because the author
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   is so concerned.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.680]   Not of the false gospel, of people just drifting.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:15.320]   And we don't normally think of drifting as dangerous unless you've experienced drifting.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:21.040]   But you know where drifting leads to because that drifting never leads to God.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.760]   It always leads us to danger.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:30.960]   And that's why the author of this letter begins by saying, "Pay attention to the Son.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:38.720]   Listen to what I have to say because the consequence is life and death."
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:44.880]   So I pray that as we take time to dig into the book of Hebrews that we would open our
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.360]   ears and pay attention as the author intends. Let's pray.
