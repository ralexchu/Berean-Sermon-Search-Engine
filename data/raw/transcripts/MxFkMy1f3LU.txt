[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.640]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.480]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.040]   I just wanna encourage us as we,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.080]   I was reflecting on this this morning for first service,
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.560]   the idea many of us come,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.240]   have gone to church for years and years and have grown up.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   And oftentimes it can be easily done
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.400]   where we just put in our time coming here
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.640]   and it's what we do on Sundays.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   I just wanna encourage us as we prepare our hearts,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.640]   as we think about who our God is,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.760]   as he looks into our heart
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.560]   and examines what we're providing
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.040]   and what we're doing here,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.800]   that he sees genuine appreciation,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.280]   a desire for his name to be glorified.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.000]   So as we sing these songs,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.100]   I pray that that may be our heart as well.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:38.260]   (gentle music)
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.680]   (gentle music continues)

[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.300]   - All right, good morning,
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.320]   and welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.060]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.100]   First of all, men's fellowship meeting,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.740]   our quarterly meeting is happening
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.100]   this coming Saturday at 9 a.m.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.140]   And again, lunch will be served,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.440]   again, the cost of it is gonna be $10.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.880]   The subject that we're gonna be covering
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.020]   is the biblical manhood, like what does that mean,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.460]   and how it should be applied in our lives and our homes.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.620]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.440]   please sign up for it.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.160]   Again, it's happening this coming Saturday at 9 a.m.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.660]   All church prayer and praise, not this week,
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.900]   but next Friday, just mark that on the calendar.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.340]   And then there is a golf tournament
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.120]   for mission fundraiser happening on June 3rd.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.600]   I'm told that you can still sign up,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   but the registration is $150, okay?
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.980]   And see Mitchell Kim and Brian Chisaki, okay?
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.100]   Again, this information will be on the website
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.380]   or on the app.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.260]   And then the signups for the VBS
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.660]   is still happening for July 10th and the 14th.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.480]   And so there is a table outside as you go.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.000]   And then you'll also see that there are T-shirts
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.240]   that are also being sold for the fundraiser.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.680]   And I wanna give a little push for the abortion seminar
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.280]   that's happening in May 28th, 1:45 p.m.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.440]   Pastor Mark is going to be giving a seminar
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.360]   on this subject and how to think biblically
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.000]   and how to apply, again, biblical mindedness
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   in what's going on in our culture right now.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.900]   There's a lot of confusion.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.940]   And sad to say, it's starting to penetrate
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.380]   even into churches.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.980]   And so Pastor Mark will be covering this subject
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.400]   and also having a Q&A time
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.940]   if you have any questions about that
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.540]   and how to think and apply these things biblically
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.780]   in what's going on on this subject.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.300]   So highly recommend, I wanna strongly recommend
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.460]   to come to this seminar.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.620]   Again, it's happening at 1:45 p.m.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.100]   And you can sign up for that.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.740]   I think that's it for today.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.060]   Okay, all right.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.800]   So let me pray for the offering.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.300]   Again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.200]   there is a physical box in the back for the rest of us.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.780]   We'll give you a minute for you to give electronically.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.540]   And then afterwards, our brother Victor
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.260]   is gonna be coming up giving his testimony
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.780]   and we'll be baptized, all right?
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.620]   Let's pray.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:05.560]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.420]   We thank you, Father, that you've blessed us,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.580]   that we are in a free country where we can worship you
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.620]   without concern of physical harm.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.380]   And I know there's a lot of brothers and sisters
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.580]   around the world, Lord God,
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.540]   who are courageous in gathering, Lord God,
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.580]   and being a witness and being a light
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.420]   in their places that you've placed them.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.740]   We pray, Father, that you would help us
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.700]   to see the blessing that we have,
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.060]   that it would not become a source of curse
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   and ease in our lives,
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.620]   but that we would maximize every good thing
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.460]   that you've given us,
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.780]   that we may return it to you in glory.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.020]   We pray, Father, that you would bless our worship,
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.540]   bless this offering.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.060]   May it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.200]   (gentle music)

[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   - Hi, everyone.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:43.140]   Hi, everyone, happy Sunday.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.140]   My testimony is about God's faithfulness
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.140]   and God's sovereignty in my life.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   My name is Victor Lei.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.140]   I grew up in a conservative Chinese family.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.140]   Although my parents didn't regularly attend church,
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.140]   every summer they sent me and my sister
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.140]   to a different Chinese summer school
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.140]   that was associated with some church.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   I'm grateful for this upbringing
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.140]   because I was exposed to the basics
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.140]   of the foundations of Christianity.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.140]   In late high school and my first two years of college,
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.140]   I was enslaved to pornography,
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.140]   experimented with marijuana and alcohol,
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.140]   gratifying the flesh with drugs,
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.140]   and giving in to lust became a regular secret thing.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.140]   There was an internal sense of guilt,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.140]   but I quickly pushed it off thinking,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.140]   I'll say sorry to God later.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.140]   I'll find God when I'm older.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   Let me have fun now.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.140]   When I finally transferred to UCSD,
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.140]   I ran quicker towards the things of this world.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.140]   Hookup culture was widely acceptable,
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.140]   partying every weekend, getting drunk just because.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.140]   I didn't look for a church down in San Diego.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.140]   I claimed to be Christian with my lips,
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.140]   but my actions looked like everyone else around me.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.140]   That sense of guilt eventually became numb.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   My life became numb and empty.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.140]   I went as far as to try and find meaning with psychedelics.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.140]   Nothing, just emptiness in my soul and deep disappointment
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.140]   because I couldn't find that something I was looking for.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   I remembered a quote when I was younger
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.140]   by C.S. Lewis from his book, Mere Christianity.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.140]   If I find in myself desires
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.140]   which nothing in this world can satisfy,
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.140]   the only logical explanation is that
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.140]   I was made for another world.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.140]   I thought to myself, I get that.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.140]   I understand that and I feel that.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   In 1 John 2.15-17 it reads,
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.140]   "Do not love the world or the things in the world.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.140]   "If anyone loves the world,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.140]   "the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   "For all that is in the world,
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.140]   "the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.140]   "and pride of life is not from the Father,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.140]   "but is from the world.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.140]   "And the world is passing away along with its desires,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   "but whoever does the will of God abides forever."
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.140]   Coming to the knowledge of God
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   and what relationship with him truly means
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.140]   wasn't an overnight thing for me,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.140]   but something did happen one night in June 2022.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.140]   The weeks leading to that night,
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   I was consistently intoxicated and numbed with marijuana
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   for weeks straight.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.140]   My brain and body felt like mush.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.140]   I felt deep sorrow for myself,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.140]   purposeless, unmotivated to live.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.140]   After experiencing this pit of sorrow,
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.140]   I felt a deep conviction from the Holy Spirit
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.140]   to just quit drugs altogether.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.140]   So that night around 9 p.m.,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.140]   I yielded for the first time,
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   and I threw away every possession related to marijuana
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.140]   in the apartment dumpster.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.140]   And in these small steps,
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.140]   yielding to the Spirit
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.140]   began a lifelong journey of sanctification,
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   being led by the Spirit and not by the flesh.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.140]   Fighting my flesh to choose God's will
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.140]   over what I want for my life.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.140]   In the depths of my sin,
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   God was faithful through it all,
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   patient for my repentance,
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.140]   actively pursuing me for my surrender
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.140]   and never letting go of me.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.140]   In this experience, God revealed how wretched my sins were,
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.140]   how great the chasm between me and God,
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.140]   and just how undeserving I am.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.140]   But in his grace, I am forgiven in Christ.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.140]   I am saved in Christ.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.140]   I was chosen in Christ.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.140]   And God has held me fast all my life
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   without me even realizing it.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.140]   I once was lost, living in sin,
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   but now I'm found.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.140]   I still struggle with sin,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.140]   but actively running away from it and towards Christ.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.140]   And to my delight, when I started yielding to God,
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   letting go of my own control,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   surrendering to God's sovereign hand,
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.140]   and submitting to his great plans,
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.140]   which I will never understand with my puny human brain,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.140]   that's exactly when I feel the most content and joyous in my life.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   From John 6, 35, Jesus said,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.140]   "I am the bread of life.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger,
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   Finding Green Community Church
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.140]   was a testament of God's faithfulness in my life.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.140]   When I moved to Orange County,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   by no mistake did God lead me to this church
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   to grow in the knowledge of and intimacy with him.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.140]   God is sovereign. God is good.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.140]   In my most recent season of life,
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.140]   I've been applying my knowledge of
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.140]   attributing everything in my life to God's sovereignty,
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   with this new church community, a new job,
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.140]   significant relationships,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.140]   every blessing and every trial divinely orchestrated.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.140]   From Romans 8, 28 it reads,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.140]   "And we know that for those who love God,
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.140]   all things work together for good,
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.140]   for those who are called according to his purpose."
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   I'm grateful for this newfound purpose to live
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   for the glory of God
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   and everlasting hope that I have in Christ.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   I'm grateful for the peaceful contentment
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   that there is nothing in this world
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   that can satisfy my soul but Christ alone,
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.140]   and I am his and he is mine.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.140]   From Romans 11, 36 it reads,
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.140]   "For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.140]   To him be glory forever.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.140]   All glory to God. Amen."
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:23.140]   (applause)
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:35.140]   - So Victor, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140]   you're being united to Christ's death,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.140]   and then when you come out,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.140]   you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   - I do.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.140]   - And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.140]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.140]   (water splashing)
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.140]   (applause)
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:33:01.140]   - All right, thank you, Victor.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 6,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.140]   we're gonna be looking at verses 1 through 11.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   Luke chapter 6, verses 1 through 11,
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   and I will be reading out of the NASB.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.140]   Okay, Luke chapter 6, verses 1 through 11.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   "Now it happened that he was passing through
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.140]   some grain fields on the Sabbath,
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   and his disciples were picking the heads of the grain,
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   rubbing them in their hands, and eating the grain.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   But some of the Pharisees said, 'Why do you do
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.140]   what is not lawful on the Sabbath?'
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   And Jesus answering them said,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   'Have you not even read what David did
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.140]   when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   How he entered the house of God
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   and took and ate the consecrated bread,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.140]   which is not lawful for any to eat,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.140]   except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   And he was saying to them,
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.140]   'The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.'
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.140]   On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.140]   and was teaching, and there was a man there
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.140]   whose right hand was withered.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.140]   to see if he healed on the Sabbath,
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:12.140]   so that they might find reason to accuse him.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.140]   But he knew what they were thinking,
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.140]   and he said to the man with the withered hand,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   'Get up and come forward.'
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.140]   And he got up and came forward.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   And Jesus said to them, 'I ask you,
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.140]   is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath,
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.140]   to save a life or to destroy it?'
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.140]   After looking around at them all, he said to him,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   'Stretch out your hand.'
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.140]   And he did so.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.140]   And his hand was restored,
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.140]   but they themselves were filled with rage,
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.140]   and discussed together what they might do to Jesus."
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.140]   Let's pray.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:49.140]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:53.140]   We pray for your Spirit.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.140]   Help us, Lord God, to have open ears,
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.140]   softened hearts,
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   and a ready will to surrender to what you teach us.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.140]   May Christ's glory and his glory alone be magnified.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.140]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:16.140]   Last week's text, we ended with Christ correcting and rebuking the Pharisees
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   by saying that new cloth needs to be on,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   new cloth cannot go on the old cloth,
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   or it's going to tear the cloth.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.140]   And also the new wine has to be in new wine skin,
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.140]   or else the old wine sin is going to burst.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.140]   And basically what he is saying is,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.140]   the old things have to go, the new things have to come.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   And that's true of anything that we do.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   If you're going to remodel your house,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.140]   and some of you guys may be in the middle of something like that,
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   in order for you to remodel your house,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.140]   you have to tear down what's there now.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   So if you're going to remodel your kitchen,
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.140]   you have to tear the old thing out in order for the new thing to come in.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   This is true even spiritually.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   When we say we want revival to come,
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.140]   God's Spirit doesn't come and revive whatever is there,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.140]   and add to whatever it is that we have built up.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   Typically when there is an outpouring of the presence of God upon,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.140]   and revival breaks out, usually he will challenge what's there.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.140]   Whatever is there that wasn't built,
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   that doesn't stand the test of the Spirit and the Word of God,
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.140]   will have to be torn down.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.140]   And so that's exactly what he was saying with these illustrations,
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.140]   that the old religion has to go,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   because what Christ is bringing is not going to be accepted in the old religious system.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:39.140]   And there is nothing more that represents the old religious system,
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   than the way that they practice Sabbath.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   So in order for Christ to come and bring what he was trying to do in the Spirit,
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.140]   in the new covenant, the old religion had to be challenged.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   And so if you look at the text, Jesus deliberately,
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.140]   he deliberately chose the Sabbath to do what he did.
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.140]   And then in fact, when he heals the man with the withered hand,
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.140]   he made sure that they were watching, everybody was watching,
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   and then because he knew they were watching,
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.140]   he made him stand up in their presence and healed them.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.140]   Almost kind of like, "You need to see this.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.140]   I know you're going to be triggered by this,
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.140]   and I'm going to deliberately trigger you."
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.140]   In fact, this is not the only text this happens.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   If you read the Gospels, you'll remember over and over and over again,
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:29.140]   the Pharisees were triggered by the fact that he kept on doing things on the Sabbath.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   In Mark chapter 1, 29, Simon Peter's mother, mother-in-law, was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:40.140]   Mark chapter 3, 1, a man with a withered hand was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.140]   John chapter 9, 1 through 16, a man born blind in Jerusalem was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.140]   Luke chapter 13, 10 through 17, a crippled woman in a synagogue
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.140]   was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:55.140]   Luke chapter 14, a man with dropsy was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.140]   Mark chapter 21, a demon-possessed man was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.140]   A lame man at the pull of Bethsaida was healed on the Sabbath.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   And John chapter 5, 1 through 18.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.140]   So it's almost kind of like Jesus knew that they were going to get triggered,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.140]   and he deliberately challenges them because, just as he said,
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.140]   until the old religion is challenged, the new religion,
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   the new covenant is not going to be accepted.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:27.140]   The issue with the Sabbath was so important to the Jews, to the Pharisees.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.140]   You can see this in John chapter 9, verse 16.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   It says, "After he heals a man who is blind, he puts clay in his eyes,
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.140]   and his eyes get opened.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.140]   And after seeing this great miracle," instead of saying, "Wow, a great miracle has happened,"
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.140]   you would think that that would be the natural reaction.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.140]   Instead, in verse 16, it says, "Therefore," some of the Pharisees were saying,
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:53.140]   "this man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath."
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:58.140]   Even as he performed miracles, they couldn't see who he was
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   because he wasn't following their rules.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   In fact, John 5, 18, it says, "For this reason, therefore, the Jews are seeking
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.140]   all the more to kill him because he not only was breaking the Sabbath,
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:14.140]   but also was calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God."
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   How can a mere man say he's God?
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   And then, not even obey the Sabbath.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:26.140]   So everything that Jesus did, walking on water, healing people,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:33.140]   opening the eyes that are blind, even raising a dead person from the grave,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:38.140]   they could not get over the fact that it's like, well, he's doing all these miraculous things,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.140]   and it seems like he has all the evidence of being the Messiah,
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   but he's not keeping the Sabbath.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   He's not keeping the things that are so important to us,
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   so therefore, he cannot be a man from God, and we need to get rid of this guy.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   As people who are 2,000 years removed from this, we can look at that and say,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   "The Pharisees were so foolish. How can they be so blind?
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   How can they have been so entangled with the Sabbath that they couldn't
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:13.140]   recognize their own Messiah that the Bible makes it so clear with so much evidence?"
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.140]   Obviously, everything in the Bible has clear application for us,
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.140]   because if we read the Scripture and say, "Well, these foolish Pharisees,
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   thank God we're not like them. Thank God we have the Word of God,"
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:31.140]   there is a tendency for all of us to measure righteousness
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.140]   and what it means to be a follower of Christ, where the Scripture clearly says,
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.140]   "Do not add to it. Do not take away from it."
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:45.140]   Usually, when we add to it or take away from it, it's always in the name of righteousness.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   Always in the name of righteousness.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.140]   We can be blinded by our own effort for righteousness,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:55.140]   what we think is right, what we think is wrong, that is extra-biblical,
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   that causes us to be blind to the truth.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.140]   This danger of Pharisees, I mean, the way that they approach the Sabbath,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   there is a danger in every single one of us if we're not careful.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.140]   In order to fully understand what's going on here,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.140]   we need to understand why they took this so seriously.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:21.140]   First of all, the Sabbath is very serious in the Old Testament.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.140]   In fact, it was so serious, the Bible says,
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:27.140]   that if a man does not keep the Sabbath, what was the penalty?
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   They were taken out of the gate and stoned. That's how serious this was.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:37.140]   This was not just a peripheral. In fact, it's one of the Ten Commandments.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:42.140]   Do not worship any other god, don't make any graven images,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.140]   and then do not use the Lord's name in vain.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.140]   And then the fourth commandment is, "Thou shalt keep the Sabbath holy,
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   and then honor your father and mother.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   Thou shalt not kill, shalt not commit adultery."
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.140]   And so, of the Ten Commandments, you have the Sabbath sandwiched right in the middle,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.140]   and verse 3 is clear to understand that you will not worship any other god.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   Number 5, 6 to 10 is about our relationship with one another,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.140]   but Sabbath is sandwiched right in the middle,
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   and we don't know where this exactly fits.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.140]   Because it seems like a ceremonial law.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   It seems like something that belongs to, maybe at the Temple,
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   maybe just to the nation of Israel, but it's given in the Ten Commandments.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.140]   And so, if you examine it carefully, you'll see that the Sabbath
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   is what connects the relationship with God and man.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   It's sandwiched right in the middle.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.140]   So they took this very seriously, because the Bible takes it seriously.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   In fact, it's introduced to us in the very creation.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.140]   God worked for six days, and on the seventh day, God rested.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   He went into Sabbath, and we all went into Sabbath with Him.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   In fact, this was so important that in the Scriptures it says
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.140]   there are two things that the nation of Israel was to practice regularly
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   as a symbol of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.140]   The first was circumcision.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.140]   So any individual, any man who wanted to become a Jew
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.140]   might be circumcised, whether you were born into it,
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.140]   whether you converted into it, because you needed to have that physical symbol.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.140]   And then the second was the Sabbath.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.140]   In Exodus 31, 13 to 16, 13 says,
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.140]   "But I ask for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:29.140]   'You shall surely observe my Sabbath, for this is a sign between me and you
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   throughout your generations.'"
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   So again, all of this so that you and I can understand
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   why this was taken so seriously.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.140]   And then in verse 16 it says, "This is a sign of a perpetual covenant,
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.140]   not only for a short period, but as long as you are my people,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:50.140]   the Sabbath will be a symbol of our covenant relationship."
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.140]   But there's something a lot more practical than this.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.140]   I mean, that in and of itself is practical.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.140]   In the book of Leviticus, in chapter 25,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   it gives us how the Sabbath was to be practiced.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.140]   And there's three different levels of Sabbath that is supposed to be practiced.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   First of all is the personal one, where the nation of Israel
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.140]   was to practice it every Sabbath, like weekly.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:18.140]   And then the land was supposed to experience Sabbath every seventh year.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:23.140]   That you're not to work it, you give it the rest every seventh year.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   And then there was the year of Jubilee, every 50th year.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.140]   Every 50th year the land was supposed to experience the Sabbath.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:38.140]   Well, it says in Leviticus 26, 34-35,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.140]   it was a warning that if you do not keep the Sabbath,
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   this is the consequence. And it says,
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.140]   "The land will enjoy its Sabbath all the days of the desolation,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.140]   while you are in your enemies."
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.140]   In other words, because you did not keep the Sabbath,
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.140]   the land will experience our force of Sabbath upon the land,
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.140]   because you would not.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.140]   And it says, "Then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbath
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.140]   all the days of the desolation.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   It will observe the rest which it did not observe on your Sabbath
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.140]   while you were living on it."
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.140]   So if you don't keep the Sabbath, God's going to force the Sabbath on the land.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.140]   That's what he says. And that's exactly what happens.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.140]   Because they would not obey his commands, what happens?
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:26.140]   At 589 BC, Babylonians come, they take them to captivity,
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.140]   and for how long are they in captivity? For 70 years.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:36.140]   So 70 years represents all the years that they would not practice the Sabbath.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.140]   So it was supposed to happen every seventh year, right?
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.140]   So for 7 times 70 is what? 490.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   For 490 years, they lived in disobedience,
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   and so God is forcing a Sabbath upon the nation of Israel.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   So automatically, some of you guys already, like your brain is already clicking.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:02.140]   Where did you hear that before? 7 times 70?
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.140]   Remember when Peter asked, like, "How many times should I forgive?"
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   "Seven times," and remember Jesus said, "Seven times 70."
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.140]   That number is not a random number.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.140]   That number appears not only there, but in the book of Daniel.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.140]   So 490 is a very significant number.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:22.140]   So Jesus was basically telling Peter, "Be as patient as I have been patient with you.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.140]   Be as gracious and forgiving as I have been gracious and forgiving with you."
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:33.140]   So because of their sin, for 70 years, this is forced upon them
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.140]   because they would not bring Sabbath upon their land.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.140]   So the Jews wanted to take this seriously.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   Once they got restored back into the land, they said,
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.140]   "We're not going to ever let this happen again."
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   So they began to keep the Sabbath.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.140]   I mean, everything that you and I know of Pharisees, right?
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.140]   I mean, they were meticulous, right?
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   All the OCDs gathered together, and they made these rules,
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:05.140]   and they were keeping this so intensely that during the Maccabean,
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.140]   during the period of the Maccabeans, the Greeks began to come in,
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.140]   and they started conquering.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.140]   And so they came to attack to conquer the Maccabeans,
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:19.140]   and because it was on the Sabbath, they would not fight back.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.140]   So on their history record, it says a thousand Jews in the caves got slaughtered,
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:29.140]   men, women, and children, because they refused to fight back.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.140]   As a result of that, the Hasmoneans created an assembly saying,
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.140]   "You know, maybe God will let us fight, because if we let this happen,
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.140]   we're going to be destroyed."
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.140]   So they actually had a council, and after that, saying,
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:46.140]   "God's making a provision that at least we can fight."
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:52.140]   But you can understand where this came from, and even the Pharisees themselves.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   Like, where did they get created?
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   The word "Pharisee" basically means to be set apart.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.140]   And the reason why they were formed is because the Greeks were coming in
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:05.140]   and bringing all kinds of immorality into all these cultures.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   By the time Jesus come, the Romans conquered all these known nations,
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   but the immorality came through the Greeks.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.140]   Now, I can list for you all the different things that came in,
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.140]   and usually when we talk about the Greeks, we talk about their culture,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.140]   their language, their philosophers, and their building, and the art,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.140]   and all the great things.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.140]   But when you study the ancient culture of the Greeks and what they brought in,
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.140]   there was no such thing as sexual immorality,
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.140]   because it was practiced by their gods.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.140]   All the sexual immorality that was brought into their culture
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   was part of their worship.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.140]   In fact, I can go on and on and explain to you the kind of things that they did,
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   but a good representation of why these Jews were so concerned
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   about the Greek culture penetrating,
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.140]   is that sexual promiscuity, if you want to call that,
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   was so rampant that they wanted to make it easy
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   to have sexual relations with children.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:15.140]   So by the culture, they would not teach children their sexual identity.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.140]   You're neither male or female.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.140]   And the reason why they did that was that they wanted to groom them,
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:27.140]   just in case a homosexual would want to take advantage of that,
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.140]   so that you would have a bunch of children who are confused,
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.140]   that they can go either way.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.140]   So again, as disturbing as that may be to us,
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.140]   in the Greek culture, there was no sexual immorality.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.140]   There were no boundaries.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.140]   So if pleasure is their greatest pursuit,
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   the greatest avenue for that pursuit is their greatest pursuit.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.140]   So the immorality that we see in the Corinth
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.140]   was not introduced by the Romans.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   It was introduced by the Greeks.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:00.140]   I don't have to connect the dots of what's happening in our culture today,
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.140]   where sexual identity is deliberately being perverted,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.140]   and it's, "Oh, you know, we're trying to free them.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.140]   We're trying to make them free, not to be oppressed."
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.140]   But look what it's leading to.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.140]   At the end, it is connected.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.140]   I mean, there is immorality.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.140]   What Satan is doing, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.140]   What Satan has been doing in the past is true today,
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.140]   and it will be true tomorrow.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.140]   And it is against this that the Pharisees were formed 150 B.C.,
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.140]   saying, "We can't allow this to happen."
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.140]   So they formed a group, and again, the name means to be set apart.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.140]   Set apart from what?
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.140]   They don't want the Hellenistic culture to come in and penetrate.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:44.140]   So we're going to be about the law.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   We're going to keep this, and we're going to make sure
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.140]   that we don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.140]   And in this particular one, the Sabbath, because of the trouble they got into--
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   we're going to make sure that this doesn't happen again--
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:02.140]   so they dedicated 24 chapters of the Talmud to how to practice this Sabbath.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.140]   24 chapters.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:10.140]   The Talmud basically is the interpretation of the law, how to apply the law.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.140]   Let me give you an example.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.140]   In their 24 chapters, it says--
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.140]   obviously, the main thing is you can't work, right?
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.140]   So they said that if you travel 3,000 feet out of your home,
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:28.140]   and 3,001 feet from that point on, you broke the Sabbath.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   So what they would do is they would put little shacks at that point,
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.140]   and then from that point on, you can go another 3,000 feet.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.140]   So if they didn't have money to build a little shack,
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.140]   all they had to do is take a rope and connect their house
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.140]   to another house across the street,
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:47.140]   and then the 3,000 measure would start from that house.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   And then if that wasn't far enough, they would just connect that with another rope.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.140]   So you can imagine all the houses were probably connected with ropes.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:58.140]   So whatever was the furthest outpost, they can just move freely
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.140]   without breaking the Sabbath.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.140]   That was part of their law.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.140]   You can throw something in the air with one arm.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   If you catch it with the same arm, it's considered not breaking the Sabbath.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.140]   But if you catch it with the other arm, that's considered work.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.140]   Then you've broken the Sabbath.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:23.140]   You can only carry something as a weight of a dried fig.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.140]   If you carry anything heavier than that, it's breaking the Sabbath.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.140]   It's considered work.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.140]   But if you cut it in half and then you carry that twice,
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   then it's not breaking the Sabbath.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.140]   This is how ridiculous, this is how meticulous their Sabbath was.
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:39.140]   So a tailor could not carry a needle, a scribe could not carry a pen,
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.140]   a pupil could not carry his books,
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.140]   because whatever it is that you were doing,
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.140]   if you carry that, that would be considered work to you.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:53.140]   Women could not wear jewelry because it was heavier than a dried fig.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:58.140]   If you lit a candle and you forget to turn it off before the Sabbath takes you,
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.140]   then you're not allowed to turn it off.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.140]   Because that would be considered work.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:08.140]   If you turn it off and the Sabbath takes you, you cannot light it.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.140]   There was 24 chapters of this.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.140]   I had about 15 more and I had to erase it
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.140]   because I didn't want to sit here and tell you all of these things.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.140]   I mean, that's a very small percentage of what they had.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.140]   So imagine how burdensome this was.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.140]   I mean, think about that.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.140]   The word Sabbath basically means rest.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.140]   Do you feel rested?
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.140]   Hearing this makes you tired.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.140]   They had 24 chapters of this.
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:37.140]   And what they considered a path of righteousness,
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.140]   when Christ comes, he says in Matthew 23, 23,
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.140]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites!
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.140]   For you tithe mint and dill and cumin
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law,
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.140]   justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.140]   But these are the things you should have done without neglecting the other."
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.140]   And then he says in verse 27, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.140]   For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful,
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.140]   but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:09.140]   So you too outwardly appear righteous to myth,
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:15.140]   but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.140]   You're so focused on the external part of who you are,
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:22.140]   inwardly you're burning in passion, you're burning with hate,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.140]   you're burning with bitterness, judgmentalism,
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.140]   whatever it is that you're burning with.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.140]   And he says, "Those things you neglect, you kind of sweep it under the rug.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:35.140]   But when it comes to external righteousness, you are experts."
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.140]   I don't know if you've ever heard this illustration before,
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   but I think it's one of the most powerful illustrations I've ever read.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.140]   Like an egg, right?
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:49.140]   An egg, when it is, it is almost meant to be broken, right?
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:54.140]   But if it is broken from the outside, it's to be eaten, right?
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:59.140]   Whatever is in the--maybe there's a potential chick that's to come out of there,
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:03.140]   but if it's broken from the outside, if we break it, it's going to die.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:08.140]   But when the egg gets broken from the inside, it's the beginning of life,
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:12.140]   because a chick is growing in there and it's ready to live.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:17.140]   See, righteousness that covers the outside,
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:22.140]   changes who we are externally, without a transformation taking place inside,
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.140]   it brings death.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.140]   All it brings is transformation.
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.140]   Like we need to do this. We need to change our behavior.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:33.140]   They're doing this, and then now you can't do this, and you've got to do this.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.140]   And think about what that adds.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.140]   How many of you had a hard week this week?
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:41.140]   How many of you have parents who are sick?
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.140]   How many of you are having a hard time paying bills?
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.140]   How many of you have a hard time raising your children?
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.140]   You're so tired, you don't know, is this it?
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:53.140]   And you're struggling, you're wrestling, you're having marriage problems,
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   and then you come to church, and it's like, do more!
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   Give more! Sacrifice more!
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   You can throw with your left hand, but you can't catch with your right hand.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.140]   You can walk this distance, but you can't walk more than that.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.140]   If you do this with your children, it's okay.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.140]   If you do that with your children, it's not okay.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:20.140]   And if righteousness is simply changing our external behavior,
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   all it does is get people who are tired, living in this fallen world, and adding more.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.140]   You're having a hard time paying your bills, and you've got to give more.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.140]   So, it's not the external things in and of itself.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:40.140]   But God didn't simply call us to change our external behavior.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.140]   He transforms us from within.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.140]   And that's why the Bible says, 2 Corinthians 5, 17, 18,
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.140]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:54.140]   The old things have passed away; behold, the new things have come."
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   When our inner life is transformed, when God transforms our heart, our desire, our joy, our hope, from within,
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   and when that life begins to grow, it begins to break the shell that bound us before.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.140]   And we are able to be free to worship, to be free to live.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   But when that shell gets broken from the outside because of pressure, because of judgment, because of expectation,
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.140]   because of "You're supposed to do this, you're supposed to do that,"
[00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:26.140]   all it brings is more pressure, more hardship.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:31.140]   See, Jesus says, "You are so concerned about how you appear,
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   but inwardly all you are filled with is dead men's bones."
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   And you can tell if that's happening or not when you carefully listen to your speech.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:51.140]   Because Jesus says, "What is inside eventually comes out of our mouth."
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:59.140]   And if righteousness is only happening externally, you can tell what's coming out of your mouth.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:07.140]   If there's true transformation taking place, or it's just the outer shell being broken.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:12.140]   Jesus came to challenge the old religion, and he tells us what the new covenant is,
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.140]   what he meant for the Sabbath.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:19.140]   In Mark chapter 227, of this recording of the same event, when they challenged him,
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:25.140]   Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for Sabbath."
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.140]   The way he answers them, he said, "Have you not even read in Luke 634,
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   when they said, 'How can you be breaking the Sabbath?'"
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:37.140]   I mean, Jesus, by taking the grain, by crushing it and putting it in their mouth on the Sabbath,
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.140]   broke at least three or four laws there. Their tradition.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   Not God's laws, but their tradition.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.140]   "How can you be a man of God and break the Sabbath?"
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   And Jesus answers them, "Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry?
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.140]   He and those who were with him. Now he entered the house of God and took and ate the consecrated bread,
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:59.140]   which is not lawful for any to eat except for the priest alone, and gave it to his companions."
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.140]   This is a very typical way that Jesus answers.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.140]   It would challenge him, like, "Should we give to Caesar or to the temple?"
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.140]   He'd say, "Give to God what is God, and give to Caesar what is Caesar."
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.140]   He's like, "Huh?"
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.140]   He just flips the table, and like, "Well, you answered this then."
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   First of all, Jesus didn't break any laws. He was breaking their tradition.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   But, if you're going to accuse me of breaking the law,
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:28.140]   if you're going to have a fit over eating this grain, what about David?
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.140]   He's referring to 1 Samuel 21, 4-6.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:37.140]   I want you to listen carefully about what happens and the point that Jesus is trying to make.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.140]   Because if you're not careful, you may read this and say,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:45.140]   "Well, Jesus does whatever he wants because he's Jesus. David does whatever he wants because he's king."
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.140]   They don't have to follow the law.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:54.140]   Remember, Jesus said, "I've not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill the law."
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.140]   Not even an iota of the law of God would pass away until it is fulfilled.
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   So, Jesus himself said, "Everything must be obeyed."
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   So, what does he mean?
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.140]   1 Samuel 21, 4-6, "The priest answered David and said,
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:12.140]   'David was on this mission that was sent by the king, and him and his men become famished,
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.140]   and they end up at the temple.'
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.140]   And he asked, 'Is there food?'
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.140]   And the priest said, 'There is no ordinary food on hand, but there is consecrated bread,
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.140]   if only the young men have kept themselves from the women.'"
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.140]   Let me stop right there.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.140]   First of all, what's happening?
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.140]   David is not the one who goes and grabs the bread.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   That bread was reserved for who? For the priests.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   So, that bread was given to the priests to eat.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.140]   So, when David says, "Is there bread?"
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:47.140]   He says, "There is no common bread for you to eat, but there is bread that is consecrated for us to eat.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.140]   I can give that to you if your men are not defiled,"
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.140]   meaning that you didn't have sexual relations with other women,
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   and so therefore, because it's consecrated, we want to make sure that you're handling it with holiness.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:06.140]   David did not just walk into the temple and got the consecrated bread.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.140]   Typically, what happens is they would leave it there for seven days,
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:14.140]   and the seventh day, it is released from the consecration for the priests to eat.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   So, by the time the priest has it, it's their food to eat.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:25.140]   And he is offering that to David, because David says, "So, in both ways, David didn't grab it,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.140]   and the priest didn't just grab anything. He said, 'What is mine?
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   If you handle this with care, then you can have it.'"
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:35.140]   So, David didn't break any laws.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.140]   He was just given the bread that the priests were supposed to eat.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.140]   But the point that Jesus is making, "You are accusing me of breaking the Sabbath,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   and there is no law being broken,
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   but if you're going to accuse me of breaking the Sabbath, what are you going to do with this?"
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.140]   You should answer this before you accuse me of this, and obviously, they have no answer.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   And the point that Jesus was making, "You don't understand the law."
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   Yes, God is serious about keeping the law,
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:09.140]   but if you don't understand the heart of God,
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   you cannot understand the mind of God.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.140]   Now, why is this so important?
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.140]   Because Jesus accuses them, Matthew 15a,
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.140]   They say the right things, but their heart's not in it.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.140]   "They worship me in vain. Their teachings are but rules taught by men."
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:35.140]   In other words, you're dissecting the letter of the law, but you do not know the heart of God.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:40.140]   In Luke 15, when Jesus is hanging around with the tax collectors and the sinners,
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   the Pharisees were offended.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:47.140]   "How can you, being a man of God, be hanging around with these sinners?"
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:54.140]   And Jesus turns the table on them, and teaches them about the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.140]   And the point of each one of these parables is, "You don't know God."
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.140]   You're trying to keep the letter of the law,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.140]   but you do not know the spirit of the law.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:11.140]   That the whole reason that the law came is to reveal your sins.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.140]   Not to make you righteous.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   God came to seek and save the lost.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:20.140]   So, the whole point is, you're trying to keep the law,
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.140]   but it's come out thinking that somehow that's going to make you righteous.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.140]   But it's to reveal your unrighteousness, just like these people,
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.140]   so that you would recognize you're in the same boat.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.140]   So that you would also repent.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   So that you would also realize that this is why Jesus came.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:42.140]   But because you do not understand God, you do not understand the law of God.
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.140]   And let me give you a perfect example of this.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   When we talk about church discipline,
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.140]   this is probably one of the most difficult things to practice at church,
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:58.140]   because however we practice it, there's going to be a segment of the church that does not understand.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.140]   In order to understand church discipline,
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   you not only need to understand the letter of the law,
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:07.140]   you need to understand the spirit of the law.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:13.140]   If you practice the letter of the law, when somebody breaks the law,
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.140]   when somebody lives immoral, and you say, "Oh, they broke this law."
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.140]   So the first step is, we talk to them, and they wouldn't listen.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   So we sent two people, and they didn't listen.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.140]   So therefore, the third is, we're going to take it to the church and shame them,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.140]   and we're going to kick them out of the church and say, "The letter of the law was followed."
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:39.140]   If we only follow the letter of the law, we can shame pretty much everybody.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:43.140]   Almost everybody who breaks the law and does not immediately repent and lead to sanctification.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:51.140]   Then, "Oh, we sent one, then we had two, and then everybody, you get out. You get out. You get out. You get out."
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:56.140]   Or, because that's hard to understand, like, "Why would we want to be gracious?"
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   And so, we sweep every sin under the rug, because we're trying to be gracious.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:08.140]   If you do not understand the letter of the law and the spirit of the law, the church discipline cannot be practiced.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:17.140]   Church discipline was meant in the context of a loving family that cares for the soul so much,
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:26.140]   that we cannot allow somebody that we love to head down this path. It's going to lead to destruction.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:35.140]   So, love compels us to act, but it is also love that tempers the judgment.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:44.140]   That discipline comes, but also in temperament, desiring with all our heart that a sinner would repent.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:49.140]   See, but if you do not see it as the letter of the law and the spirit of the law,
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.140]   then either we don't practice it or we bring the hammer every time.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   Let me give you another example. The Bible says, "Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless there's two or three witnesses."
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:10.140]   If the church had ten people, two or three witnesses is 30%, and that's a pretty decent number of people.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:18.140]   A church of a thousand, I'm almost certain that our church, we're like hovering around there,
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   that I'm pretty sure you can find three people who love this church.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:29.140]   They love the people, they love the small groups, they love the missions, they love all that.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:36.140]   Only if we can get this short stocky guy, he keeps yelling up on the pulpit and he says things I don't like.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:42.140]   Only if we can change the pastor. I'm pretty sure they can find three people.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.140]   I'm pretty sure they can find more than three people at the church right now who's unhappy with me for some reason.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:54.140]   And thinking the answer to the next level of this church is to switch the pastor.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:07:03.140]   So if you follow the letter of the law, get those three people together and you will fulfill the letter of the law.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.140]   But is that what that means?
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:12.140]   Anyway, even if we have 10,000 or 50,000, just find three people.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:18.140]   If those three people are in agreement, you can remove him by the letter of the law.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.140]   But what he means by that is, is there a consensus?
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.140]   Is there an agreement in the church?
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.140]   Is this what a lot of people think?
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   And if that's the case, then he said, then maybe that pastor needs to be removed.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:45.140]   If we follow the letter of the law, anything that we find, "Oh, we did this, we did this, and we're being righteous because we're following what it says to the letter."
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:54.140]   But if you do not understand the spirit of the law, of why he gave the law, and for what purpose,
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:08:00.140]   then we can take the letter of the law and become destructive.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:06.140]   That's why Jesus says people who are under this heavy obligation,
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:10.140]   he says in Matthew 9, 12, 13, "But when Jesus heard this, he said,
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:16.140]   'It is not those who are healthy who need the physician, but those who are sick, but go and learn what this means.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:21.140]   I desire compassion and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.'"
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:27.140]   Jesus is quoting Hosea 6, verse 6, when he's telling the nation of Israel,
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.140]   in the midst of a lot of religiousness, he says, "For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice,
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.140]   and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offering."
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:40.140]   In other words, you cannot understand the letter of the law unless you have the heart of God.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:46.140]   Unless you understand why the letter was given, and why these things were to be practiced.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:53.140]   So, if in the church you have a lot of people who know the Bible, but do not love Christ,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:58.140]   it becomes a very dangerous thing, the word of God becomes a very dangerous thing,
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:03.140]   with people who will use it to hurt other people,
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.140]   if you do not understand the spirit of the law.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:11.140]   He's not nullifying the law at all,
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   but he wants us to understand why it was given to us in the first place.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.140]   In Matthew 23, verse 4, it says, "They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders,
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:25.140]   but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger."
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:30.140]   So focused on external righteousness, so focused on trying to break the outer shell,
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:35.140]   when there's no transformation taking place from within.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:42.140]   And here's a crazy thing. He said the Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   Not for us to serve the law, but the law to serve us.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.140]   But then the second thing he says in Luke 6, 5, and he was saying to them,
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.140]   "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.140]   Not only does he say that, but after he gives the illustration of David, he says,
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.140]   Matthew 12, 6, "But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here."
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   Now think about what that is. The temple is a place where even the high priest couldn't enter into certain parts.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.140]   They have to be consecrated.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.140]   And he said, "Well, if you're going to accuse me of breaking the law,
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:20.140]   David went into the temple and he did these things, but he said,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.140]   if you're going to accuse me, and you're okay with that,
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.140]   I'm telling you something greater than the temple." Do you know what that means?
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.140]   What is greater than the temple?
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:36.140]   There's only one thing greater than the temple. God himself.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:41.140]   Think about how meticulously they were holding on to the Sabbath.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:48.140]   And Jesus says, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.140]   Either you believed him and you knew exactly what he was saying,
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   you bowed down and said, "You are God. How can God be among us?"
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   Or you would have picked up stones to stone him right there.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.140]   How can you, a mere man, say that you're greater?
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.140]   You are the Lord of the Sabbath, greater than the temple.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:13.140]   And that's exactly what he was saying.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.140]   And that's what Paul tells us in Colossians 2, 16 and 17.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:20.140]   "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink,
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:23.140]   in respect to festival or new moons or Sabbath day,
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:29.140]   things which are mere shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ."
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:34.140]   In other words, that Sabbath you are trying so hard to obey,
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   was given to you simply as a shadow,
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.140]   so that you would recognize when the substance came.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.140]   But because you used the Sabbath for self-righteousness,
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:50.140]   you used the Sabbath as a measuring stick.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.140]   So when the substance came, you didn't recognize it.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:12:02.140]   So the old religion had to go in order for the new wine, the Holy Spirit, to come.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:07.140]   When the Pharisees, when the disciples asked him,
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.140]   "What's the greatest law?"
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.140]   You know, remember what Jesus said.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:18.140]   The reason why they asked this question is because this was a constant debate.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.140]   What's the greatest law?
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.140]   Many of the Pharisees would have said, "It's the Sabbath."
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.140]   It's the Sabbath.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.140]   But you, sir, you, master, you seem like you're an expert.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.140]   What's the greatest law?
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.140]   Remember what Jesus says?
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.140]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and strength."
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.140]   Soul, mind, and strength.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.140]   And second is like it.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.140]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.140]   Why does he say that?
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.140]   Because he's challenging their view of the law.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.140]   He's correcting their old religion.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   He's basically telling them that you are so concerned about which law.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140]   Did we do this right?
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.140]   Did we not do it right?
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:00.140]   But he said, "Do you realize that all of that was given to you so that you can love God?"
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:08.140]   So the greatest thing that we need to be asking ourselves is not did we follow meticulously the letter of the law.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.140]   Now, it's important.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.140]   Jesus said that not an iota will pass away.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.140]   It's not saying that it's not important.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:23.140]   But he said the greatest purpose of the law is to bring you to himself, to love God.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   Love God.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:30.140]   Now, before we evaluate in our lives and other people's lives, are they doing this?
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.140]   Are they not doing this?
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.140]   Am I doing this?
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.140]   Am I not doing this?
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:39.140]   The greatest question we should be asking is do I love Christ?
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.140]   Do I genuinely love Christ?
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.140]   Now, some of you say I love you very easily.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.140]   Now, I'm not judging anybody.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.140]   Some of you, "I love you.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.140]   Love."
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.140]   And you write a letter.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.140]   "Love.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   Love.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.140]   Love.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.140]   Love."
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.140]   And you use it very loosely.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:03.140]   Maybe you really are so filled with love you can't help contain it.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:09.140]   Some of you, some of you, love is reserved when somebody dies.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.140]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.140]   Like, "I love you."
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.140]   It's so serious.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   Right?
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:19.140]   If you use that term love, it's just generically speaking, I think for most people.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   If you say I love you to somebody that you don't genuinely love, it is as awkward as
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.140]   it can get.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.140]   You see it on your face.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   "I love you."
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   Right?
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.140]   "I don't buy it."
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.140]   Right?
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.140]   Because it's very awkward.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.140]   You're saying something that's really not coming out, especially if somebody that you
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   don't like, "I love you."
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   Right?
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.140]   It just doesn't come out right.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   It's awkward.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:49.140]   But when you say that to somebody that you're compelled, right, when your wife on the honeymoon,
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.140]   your husband, you know what I mean, that you typically see at a wedding and the couple
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   standing there and you're just oozing love, you know what I mean?
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   Or your children, you know?
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.140]   You know what it's like.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:07.140]   You have a child and, you know, you go in there and I remember the, you know, when our
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:12.140]   children were younger coming home after, you know, like two, three weeks away and I come
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   back and they're sound asleep and I want to wake them up.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.140]   Right?
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.140]   Just so that I can, you know, because I feel good.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.140]   I miss them.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:30.140]   When you're genuinely loving something, the natural expression is love.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:37.140]   Your body language, your eyes, your heart, your words, right?
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:42.140]   But when that's not there, everything is show.
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.140]   I'm supposed to say it.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.140]   I put it on cards.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140]   I'm supposed to say it.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:51.140]   So you say it, it's just awkward and that's where hypocrisy gets built.
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.140]   Right?
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:57.140]   Jesus says to the Samaritan woman, "God is not looking for people who's going to worship
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.140]   on this mountain.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.140]   Are we supposed to worship in this mountain or that mountain?
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.140]   Are we supposed to worship here?
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.140]   Are we supposed to keep the Sabbath this way or that way?"
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   He said, "What God is looking for are people who will worship him in spirit and in truth."
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:15.140]   Not just the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law where people are inspired by what
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.140]   Christ has done for us.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:23.140]   And when we sing about his grace, that we're overwhelmed by what he has done.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   And so there is an inner changing that's happening in our hearts.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:31.140]   And we're beginning to break out of the shell that bound us.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.140]   And it says, "If you abide in my word, my word abide in you.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.140]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:44.140]   And it says, "When the son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   The danger of the Sabbath is a danger that all of you, all of us, been a Christian for
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:57.140]   five years, ten years, thirty years, forty years, that we build up habits, thinking that
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   that's what makes us righteous.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:06.140]   But what God is looking for is a transformation in our heart that causes us to be true worshipers.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.140]   So this morning, if I can ask the Praise Team to come up.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:17.140]   And as we sing this song, this song represents what I believe that we need to focus our attention on.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   It comes from Ecclesiastes 5, 1 through 2.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:26.140]   It says, "Guard your steps as you go to the house of God and draw near to listen, rather
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.140]   than to offer the sacrifice of fools.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:32.140]   For they do not know they are doing evil."
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.140]   Isn't that crazy?
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:38.140]   That they're coming to worship God and make sacrifices.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.140]   God's the one who told them to sacrifice.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:47.140]   God's the one who said, "Come into his gates with singing in our hearts."
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.140]   But he says, "They do not know that these sacrifices are sacrifices of fools, and their
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.140]   assembly is evil."
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.140]   Think about that.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:01.140]   Our worship can be evil.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.140]   Think about the damage hypocrisy has done in human history.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:10.140]   How many people will not come to church because you guys are the same?
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.140]   You're no different.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.140]   You're doing this, you're doing that, and you guys are talking about righteousness,
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.140]   but I don't see you any different.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:23.140]   Think about how false religion is the biggest hindrance to the gospel.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:29.140]   Not the government, not the laws, the false religion is what keeps people away from God.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.140]   And that's why he says, "These sacrifices of fools, they're evil.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:36.140]   Do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God,
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.140]   for God is in heaven and you are on earth.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.140]   Therefore, let your word be few."
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   Let the word of God dwell in you richly that we may respond to God in true worship.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:52.140]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll close with the closing song.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   Gracious Father, we pray that your word will continue to penetrate and mold our hearts,
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   our thoughts, our lives, that it may bring the greatest glory to your name.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.140]   Lord, search us and know us, see if there's any hurtful ways in us,
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:14.140]   that the worship that we give you may truly be in spirit and in truth.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.140]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:22.140]   [music]
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:45.140]   You are God in heaven, and here am I, honored.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:55.140]   So I'll let my words be few.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:08.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   And I'll stand in awe of you.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   Yes, I'll stand in awe of you.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.140]   And I'll let my words be few.
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:14.140]   So this is the simplest of all love songs I want to bring to you.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:24.140]   So I'll let my words be few.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:37.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:49.140]   And I'll stand in awe of you.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:22:01.140]   Yes, I'll stand in awe of you.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   And I'll let my words be few.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:20.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:27.140]   And I'll let my words be few.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:39.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:50.140]   And I'll stand in awe of you.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:23:00.140]   And I'll let my words be few.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:12.140]   Jesus, I am so in love with you.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:16.140]   Let's pray.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:24.140]   Father, we pray that the words that you have anointed,
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   and your very breath, Lord God, that you have placed in your words,
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:35.140]   would cause us, Lord, to be the aroma of Christ wherever we go.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.140]   Help us, Lord God, to see the world that we live in,
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.140]   that we would not live in isolation,
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.140]   that you would challenge us to live outside of our bubble.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.140]   Know, Father God, that there are hurting people around us,
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.140]   inside the church, outside the church,
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.140]   who are in desperate need of hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.140]   Help us, Lord God, to be hidden in Christ,
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:02.140]   that we may eagerly look for the glory that will come in Christ,
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.140]   that we may be able to live as you live, go as you go,
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   that we would have compassion for those who are lost,
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.140]   that we would recognize your word and your church and our fellowship,
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:17.140]   all in the context of you pursuing sinners like us.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   Help us to join your work.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:24.140]   Help us, Lord God, to be an extension of your heart.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:30.140]   So bless us, Lord God, as you send us, that we may magnify Christ,
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.140]   that we may be a brighter and brighter light wherever it is that you send.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.140]   In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   God sent his Son.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.140]   They called him Jesus.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:52.140]   He came to love.
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:57.140]   Heal and forgive.
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:02.140]   He lived and died.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   To buy my heart.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:18.140]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior's lips.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:28.140]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:38.140]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:48.140]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:05.140]   Worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.140]   Nice harmony.
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:14.140]   Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:17.140]   Worthy of every breath we could ever take.
