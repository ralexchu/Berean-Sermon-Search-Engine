[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Hi, my name is Jessica and I recently got married to John Yang and started coming out
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.440]   to Bury Inn last year and this is my testimony of why I would like to get baptized today.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   I grew up as the only child in a Christian family with a God-fearing father who served
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.240]   the church as an elder and a very sacrificial mother who was a great helper to my dad in
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.560]   both the church as a deacon and the home as a wife.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.240]   Until this day, two of God's greatest blessings in my life are giving me such godly parents
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.440]   who are able to show me every single day what it means to truly live a life honoring Christ.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.680]   As a result of growing up in a Christian family, I was baptized as an infant and then confirmed
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   again at a later age.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   However, it wasn't until I completed the session on baptism through BCC membership
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.080]   I started really considering the importance of a believer's baptism as compared to an
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.000]   infant baptism.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.960]   Although I was baptized as an infant, I was not at an age where I could profess with my
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.960]   mouth that Jesus is Lord and make the conscious decision to offer my life up to him.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.040]   Looking back, it's hard for me to pinpoint the exact moment that it came to faith, but
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.520]   it most likely did not happen before I was infant baptized.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.360]   From an early age, I remember learning about who Jesus is, that he died on the cross for
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   my sins, then rose again three days later, and with a very childlike faith, I took that
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.520]   knowledge and just accepted it as the truth.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.800]   So although I did not have a defining moment that I can call out as the exact instance
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.080]   I accepted Christ, I do have several milestones in my life that I would define as pivotal
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.600]   moments where I consciously made the decision to repent of my sins, take up the cross, and
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.040]   follow Christ.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   And one of those moments happened during the summer of my sophomore year of college when
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.200]   I decided to go overseas on a short-term missions trip to India.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.480]   To be honest, I think a huge reason I went on missions was simply because it just seemed
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   like the right thing to do.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   I've always grown up trying to do the right thing, whether that was in school, at church,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.960]   relationally, or even thinking towards a career.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.800]   Now reflecting back, I very much based my salvation on my works and had a lot of pride
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   in the fact that I grew up living my life as a pretty good Christian.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.000]   But once I went to India, God opened my eyes and humbled me to see for what felt like the
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.600]   first time the true depths of my own sins and my desperate need of a savior.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.440]   In India, God gave our team opportunity after opportunity to evangelize and even teach the
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.960]   Bible to students of all ages during our English camps.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.400]   It was during this time that I really dove into reading scripture and praying because
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.720]   I realized that I could not love, let alone teach, about a God that my mind did not know.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.320]   And in order for my mind to know Christ, I needed to diligently and consistently be studying
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   God's Word, something I had previously never done because I did not have as high of a view
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.880]   of scripture as I should have.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.400]   I began to realize that although I had grown up as a Christian my whole life, there were
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   so many areas in my life that were lacking and in desperate need of repentance.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   I never really considered how prideful I was in highlighting all the good works in my life
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.600]   and just how comfortably I'd been living my life, always straying away from the difficult
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   conversations around faith and Christianity.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.720]   I thought about all the times I served in church or in my campus ministry for my own
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.080]   glory and recognition rather than for God's glory because I truly wanted to give Him all
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   the honor and praise.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.680]   India was the first time I genuinely learned to repent to God because I understood the
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.040]   breadth and depth of my sins.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.800]   Since India, I have tried to the best of my abilities to walk in a manner worthy of the
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.520]   Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.320]   knowledge of God, as Colossians 110 says.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.660]   But after completing my membership sessions at Berean, I started to think about the definition
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.480]   of baptism and how it is a believer's act of publicly committing him or herself to Christ
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   and His people, thereby uniting a believer to the church and setting themselves apart
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.760]   from the world.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.960]   Because I was infant baptized, I never had the chance to publicly commit myself to Christ
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.160]   and profess my faith and submission to Christ on my own accord.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   This led me to do more research on what Scripture had to say about baptism and the validity
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.680]   of my infant baptism.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.260]   So based off my readings, I came to believe that baptism truly is only reserved for those
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.580]   who are known to be disciples of Christ, as taught in Matthew 28 in the book of Acts and
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.700]   assumed in Romans 6, where it talks about our old self being crucified with Christ so
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.200]   that we would no longer be slaves to sin and become obedient from the heart and become
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.940]   slaves of righteousness.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.040]   As an infant, I did not make the conscious decision to follow Christ or be baptized and
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.340]   live consistently with an earnest confession of sin and repentance.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.060]   But today, as an adult, I have a greater grasp as to what baptism is.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.180]   As stated in Romans 6, it is a ceremony that symbolically unites us with Christ in His
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.300]   death and resurrection and also signifies rebirth.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.100]   I understand that baptism in and of itself does not save me, but my genuine profession
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.020]   of faith has led me to making the conscious decision of getting baptized today, which
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.220]   will testify that I have received a new self, have been renewed, am spirit and dwelt, and
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.100]   have received complete forgiveness of sins, and I'm united to Christ in His death and
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.100]   resurrection.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100]   Thank you.
