[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 16 verse 17 to 20.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Romans chapter 16 verse 17.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Shawn, Shawn, can you do me a favor and close that door?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.200]   I'm going to be reading verse 17 to 20.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.160]   Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.140]   contrary to the teaching which you learn, and turn away from them.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.320]   For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ, but of their own appetites, and by their smooth
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.840]   and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.680]   For the report of your obedience has reached to all, therefore I am rejoicing over you.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.500]   But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000]   The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.040]   Let's pray.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.720]   We thank you for the blessings in our lives that we are aware of and the things that we
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.200]   are not aware of.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680]   I pray, Father, that you would search our hearts.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.000]   If it is callous, please, Lord, make it soft.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.760]   If our minds are wandering, help us, Lord, God, to be focused on your word.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.560]   If we are discouraged, I pray that your presence and your word would encourage us.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.440]   Equip your church with your word, Lord God, that we may be thoroughly equipped for every
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440]   good work.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.760]   Amen.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.960]   Let me ask you, start off the sermon with a question.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.120]   Is there something that you can name in your life that you are willing to give your life
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.800]   to guard?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.120]   Is there something that you can think of in your life that you are willing to give your
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.120]   life to guard?
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.520]   One of my favorite quotes from Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement,
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.880]   he said, "If a man does not have anything to die for, he really has nothing to live
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   for."
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   Again, he was obviously talking about the Civil Rights Movement and he was willing to
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180]   give his life with all the different threats that were coming in and that this cause was
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.560]   bigger than him and he was willing to give his life for it.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.680]   In that quote, and obviously I'm not necessarily talking about civil rights, but that quote,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   to believe in something that is so precious that it is beyond even our own lives.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.040]   I think if you're parents, you would automatically think that of your children, that without
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.360]   a doubt you would give your life in order to save your kids.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.240]   And at some point, those of you who are raising small children, at some point your kids are
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.720]   going to be old enough where you're going to ask yourself, are they old enough for me
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.720]   to leave behind?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.520]   When they're young, they're attached to you at the hip and at some point, maybe 13, 14,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.760]   15, I don't know, where you're going to start thinking, is it okay for me to leave them?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.880]   So 15 years of being attached to the hip and then at some point you're going to make that
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.160]   decision.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.520]   When you make that decision, you'll go through all kinds of thoughts and precaution.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.200]   You'll tell your kids, when I leave, somebody knocks on the door, don't open it.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.320]   Here's all the food, if there's an emergency, here's the thing, you're going to talk to
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.880]   your neighbors and you want to make sure that your kids are taken care of.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.280]   And eventually, obviously, they're going to grow up and you don't need to worry about
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   that.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   But every parent goes through that transition because they are so precious to you.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.440]   The text that we're looking at this morning, Apostle Paul, as he is writing the final conclusion
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:42.320]   of the 16 chapters of the gospel, he's writing a letter of concern that after he is done,
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.160]   that the wolves are going to come in and they're going to come to devour.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.560]   So he's giving them precautions to make sure that you watch, make sure that you take care
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.320]   of these things because there are people who are going to come in and they're going to
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.560]   try to disrupt you.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   Apostle Paul guarded the gospel with his own life.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.400]   We know that from church history, we know that from the writing, that even as in the
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.880]   context of being beaten, he was spreading the gospel.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.520]   In fact, that's exactly what he tells Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 620.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.880]   So Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.080]   and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.320]   Again, in 2 Timothy 1, 13 and 14, retain the standard of sound words, which you have heard
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.960]   from me in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.360]   Guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us the treasure which has been entrusted to
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   you.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.360]   So as Apostle Paul is transitioning from his ministry and giving the baton to Timothy,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   the primary thing that he's concerned with Timothy is make sure you guard this gospel
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   and guard it with your life.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.120]   And we know that that's exactly what happened.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.920]   Apostle Paul gave his life guarding this gospel.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.960]   Timothy, according to church history, went back to the church of Ephesus and served as
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.080]   the pastor of that church for many, many years.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.240]   But at the end of his life, the heretics began to come in and idolatry began to come into
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240]   the church.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.440]   And he was, according to church tradition, stood up against it and he was stoned and
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.120]   beaten to death.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.600]   He guarded the gospel in the church of Ephesus with his life.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.440]   We know that the men and women that are listed in chapter 16 were probably the first martyrs
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.560]   of the Roman church.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.880]   Under Nero, persecution comes out full force by the Roman government.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.640]   Up to this point, in fact, Apostle Paul was protected by the Roman government.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.320]   But because of Nero, Nero decides in AD 64 that he's going to blame the Christians for
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.240]   what happens to the buildings burning down and a mass persecution of Christians happened.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.320]   So the first group of Christians that were martyred are probably on this list.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.040]   So it kind of makes me think, you know, when men and women go to war and they come back
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.520]   and they lose a lot of their friends and you go to the war monuments and you have the list
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.960]   of all these names and every Memorial Day they will read off the names of these people
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.440]   gave their life to protect this country.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.040]   Well that's this list.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.360]   This is the list of men and women who gave their lives so that you and I could have the
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.920]   gospel.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.600]   Paul is telling this church.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.140]   I gave you 16 chapters of exposition of this precious gift that God has given us.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.440]   But these wolves are going to come in and you need to protect this.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.320]   So the text that we're looking at this morning, chapter 17, verse 17 through 20, there's three
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.080]   things that he commands them to do.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.040]   One is to be watchful, to look carefully, to be sober.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   Secondly, he tells them once you recognize these wolves to separate from them.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.840]   Don't play this game.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   Right?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.440]   And then the third, which is mentioned in verse 19 to discern, discern between good
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.800]   and bad.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.580]   When I started preparation for this sermon at the beginning of the week and in the latter
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.640]   part of last week, I thought I'm going to cover all of it this week.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   And then, you know, after preparation, by the time I came to Thursday night and Friday,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.720]   I said, well, you know, I think I'm only going to be able to cover two of them.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.320]   And then last night I decided I'm only going to cover one.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   Right?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   So partially because I'm not ready to move on from Romans, partially.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.280]   And the other part of it is I think this is important enough for us to take time and really
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.260]   discern and to be sober in what Paul is saying.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.800]   So anytime you read somebody's letter and the last part of it, you know it's important.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   But considering the impact of the book of Romans that it had on not only us, but Christianity
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   itself, and that he is concluding this letter, that it's not random things that are in here.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.720]   These are things that we need to pay very close attention to.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.900]   And especially because it is repeated.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.980]   What he says here is repeated in almost every letter.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.520]   So I want to take some time, as Paul warns them, he says, once I leave, these wolves
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   are going to come.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   So to pay attention.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   So the first one, he says to be watchful.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.760]   And our responsibility to guard this gospel, the first thing that we need to do is to watch.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.620]   In verse 17 he says, now I urge you, brethren, to keep your eye on those who cause dissensions
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.000]   and hindrances.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.880]   Again, he uses the word urge for the purpose of, to sense the importance of what Paul is
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.040]   about to say.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.520]   And the word itself, to keep watch, is scopaeo.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.160]   Where you can already hear the English word in that, to scope out something.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.680]   So if you're on a trip for reconnaissance and you're scoping out where your enemies
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.560]   may be, that's the word scope, to take aim at something, to hone in something.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.360]   So this is not a word where you're just kind of going to the beach and just watching the
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.720]   sunset.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.560]   It means, like a watchman, like in the book of Ezekiel, that you've been planted to watch
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.440]   for danger that is coming.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:11.400]   And so he's telling the church of Rome that once this is done, the enemies, these wolves
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   are going to come and they're coming deliberately to divide, to confuse, and destroy.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.720]   So look out for them.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.880]   Do you remember where this letter was being written?
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.800]   It's a rhetorical question, so you don't need to say anything.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.360]   If you remember in the beginning of the study of the book of Romans, Paul was writing this
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.400]   in the city of Corinth.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.300]   So you know, if you've read or studied 1 and 2 Corinth, the Corinthian church was a mess.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.520]   It was a divided church, and because they were divided, they had all kinds of immorality
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.340]   come in, and they had false doctrine.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.660]   Even their communion table was corrupted.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.080]   Their worship was utter chaos.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.760]   Everybody wanted to show off their spiritual gifts.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.240]   A lot of that came in because they weren't paying attention to the right doctrines.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.080]   The Judaizers were coming in, and they were beginning to implant false gospel into the
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.120]   church, and then they were beginning to divide.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.760]   Well, who should we pay attention to?
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.960]   Who's going to correct us?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.440]   Is it going to be Paul?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   Is it going to be Apollos?
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.400]   And as a result of that, the church was being destroyed.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.520]   So you can imagine why, as Apostle Paul is concluding this letter, he's giving them precautions
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.680]   so that this doesn't happen to you in Rome, that this church in Corinth that he loved,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.820]   he risked his life to get the gospel into, as he is writing this, he's probably looking
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.760]   at all the chaos that's coming into this church, saying, "Don't let this happen to you."
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.680]   This is not unique to the church of Corinth, and this is not unique to the church in Rome.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   Paul says this in almost every letter he writes.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.720]   If you look at Acts 20, 28-32, at the end of Apostle Paul's third missionary journey,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.320]   he is about to go to Jerusalem, and a prophet has already told him that if you go there,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.960]   you're going to be bound and beaten.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:09.600]   Paul says, "I'm ready to even give my life, if that's the case, to get the gospel out."
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.440]   So he spends his last night, he calls the elders of the church of Ephesus, which he
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.560]   spent more time at that church than any other church in his missionary journey, and he spends
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.760]   the last night, before he heads to Jerusalem, warning them the same thing that he's warning
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.560]   the church here in Rome.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.320]   In Acts 20, 28-32, it says, "Be on guard."
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.400]   In other words, be sober.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.280]   "Watch for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.400]   to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.440]   I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come."
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.240]   You notice here, he doesn't just say, "Here's some people who are going to come with some
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.720]   difference of opinions that you may not agree with."
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.920]   He calls them "savage wolves."
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.240]   And the intent of a savage wolf is not simply to come and bite you and to annoy you.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.320]   The intent of a wolf is to come and completely destroy you.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.520]   So Paul uses this language to tell them, "Danger is coming."
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:22.440]   He's not saying danger might come, that there's going to be danger roaming around over there.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.520]   He says, "Danger is going to come to you.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.480]   It's coming."
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.640]   But look where it says, "Where this danger is going to come.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.240]   Savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock, and from among your own
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.520]   selves men will arise."
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.880]   Where did he say the savage wolves are going to be?
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.000]   Not on the outside of the gate.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.840]   He says it's going to be in you, in the congregation, in the church.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.480]   So he's not saying to go off to the horizon and watch for these false prophets that are
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.480]   coming.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.760]   He said, "No, there's going to be men and maybe women who are going to be influenced
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.520]   by false teaching, by their own appetites and desire, and there are going to be men
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.880]   and women of influence who's going to destroy the church."
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.600]   He says, "Watch for them inside the church, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.080]   after them.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.720]   Their whole goal is self-glory."
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.340]   And Paul's going to talk about that later on, and I'll talk about that next week.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:28.760]   That their whole motivation isn't for the truth, but for themselves.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.040]   He says, "Be on the alert, remembering night and day for a period of three years, I did
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.280]   not cease to admonish each one with tears, and now I commend you to God and to the words
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   of His grace."
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.760]   He said, "Be on the alert because these wolves are going to come, and they're going to be
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.800]   in your midst.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.680]   Be sober because they're going to come to destroy."
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.400]   And then he says, "How do you keep watch?
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   Keep yourself in the Word of God."
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.480]   He's not simply saying, "Go look in the horizon and see who's doing weird things."
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.280]   He says, "No, if you want to be watchful, watch what the Word of God says.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.320]   Be so saturated in God's Word that you can smell a heretic.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.800]   You can automatically imagine."
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.320]   I don't think my God would say that.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.520]   I don't think my God would do that.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.400]   That you would be so saturated and renewed by your mind that you can begin to even smell
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.520]   the difference between the world and God.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.160]   See satanic work typically comes through people.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.440]   When he says, "Keep an eye out," he doesn't say, "Keep an eye out for false doctrine."
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.720]   Look what he says in verse 17.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.240]   "Keep an eye out on who?
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:53.300]   On those, on people, on those who cause dissensions and hindrances."
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:15:03.160]   You and I know that God has chosen to use men and women like you and I to do God's work.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.380]   God can easily open up the sky and say, "Listen to me.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.520]   Do what I tell you to do."
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.140]   But the normal way that God uses, God uses the foolishness of preaching.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.440]   God uses the foolishness of men's commitment.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.920]   God uses us.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   In the same way, Satan mimics the work of God seeking his own glory.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   And the scripture says that.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.360]   It says in 1 Timothy 4, 1 and 2.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.720]   But the Spirit explicitly says.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.120]   Now remember, he could just say the Spirit says.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.800]   And that in and of itself will come with authority.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   God says.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.720]   I mean, you don't have to say the Almighty God says.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   You can say God says.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.120]   I mean, that's all included.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:57.360]   But the fact that the Holy Spirit goes out of its way to say he explicitly says, he's
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.840]   emphasizing that this was not just something that was passed on from apostle to apostle.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.960]   This was kind of well-known in the church.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.880]   It means there was a special utterance by the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.100]   We don't know if it was audible.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.240]   We don't know if it was through a vision.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.760]   But it was something that was emphasized.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   And that's why he says he explicitly says.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.640]   In other words, pay attention because this is really important.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.600]   That in later times, some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.040]   and doctrines and demons by means of hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.560]   with a branding iron.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.600]   Again, in 2 Corinthians 11, 14.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.400]   No wonder for even Satan disguises himself as angel of light.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   And therefore, it is not surprising if his servant also disguises himself as servants
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.960]   of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.860]   Satan does not come dressed as Satan.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:02.460]   If Satan was easy to point out, no one would be deceived.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.120]   He comes deceiving.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.040]   And when you are deceived, you are not aware that you are deceived.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.560]   That's why he's so good at what he's doing.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.520]   He said he comes in as an angel of light.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:20.240]   In other words, as a servant of Christ, preaching the word in godly attire.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.360]   And that's why he says to be watchful, to be careful.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.160]   So much destruction of the church, it did not come from the outside attack.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.320]   It came from pulpits.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.680]   It comes from Bible studies.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.840]   It comes from small groups.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.600]   It comes from discipleship.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.540]   Because it is within the church.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.760]   And he's not telling them that these guys may come.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.920]   They're all out there.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.480]   If you knew that there was a thief who's been robbing everyone's house, now they're
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.640]   targeting your street.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.400]   That's very different than saying, you know what, there's a lot of thieves in this area,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.680]   so watch out.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.360]   Versus, that thief is targeting your house.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.320]   You're not going to go to sleep nonchalantly that night.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320]   Right?
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.160]   You're going to make sure the doors are locked, heavily locked.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   Right?
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.760]   You're going to have your piece with you, if you have one.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.080]   If you're against that, you got a bat or a hammer or whatever it is that you may own
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   to protect yourselves.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.440]   And you're going to make sure that you're prepared.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.840]   You're going to have your family run a drill.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.880]   If something happens, make sure you go through the back, you call.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.280]   You're going to have your phone near you.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.640]   You're going to be prepared.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.120]   There's a huge difference between saying, there's thieves in this area, versus that
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.640]   thief is targeting you.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.160]   That's exactly how the Bible describes our enemy.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.040]   A roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.780]   Who do you think that someone is?
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.360]   If he is seeking God's glory, and he is against the things of Christ, and he's called anti-Christ,
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.500]   anyone who is a follower of this Christ, he's going to be against.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.200]   His very name says that.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.000]   He's not just targeting people.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.300]   He says he's targeting you.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.480]   How does that cause us to be sober?
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.200]   How does that cause us to view our lives when you recognize there is satanic work to bring
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.880]   you down, to confuse the church, to confuse your life, and then to destroy you?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.200]   Revelation chapter 13, some of you guys who remember that far when we were studying, if
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.400]   you remember, Satan mimics everything that God does.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.360]   We have God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   Satan has the dragon, the anti-Christ, and the false prophet.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.680]   If you remember in chapter 13, the false prophet, again, he mimics being crushed in the head,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.240]   and then he comes back to life.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   Everybody is amazed.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.120]   It says everybody begins to follow this false prophet, and the false prophet basically turns
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.200]   over his followers to the dragon.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   Remember that study?
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.320]   A couple of you.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.540]   How Satan mimics everything that God does for the purpose of his own glory.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.640]   So you know what that teaches us?
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:20.440]   It teaches us that the primary enemies of the cross are coming within the church.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.120]   Look at church history.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.680]   The primary thing that hurt the church were not the crusades with Muslims.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   You know, as much as we say it's the secularists and it's ISIS, that's not where the greatest
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.560]   damage to the church is coming from.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.360]   It's coming from within the church.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   Now you can say, "Well, satanic influence, we would think that we would be able to recognize
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.360]   satanic influence, and I don't think it's that easy."
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.560]   As detrimental and as serious as this is, there's a difference between someone being
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.800]   satanically possessed versus someone who is being hindered.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:09.400]   Now if you remember, the distinction between Judas and Peter, they were both hindered by
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:15.040]   Satan, but Judas, the Satan actually enters into him and takes over, and he begins to
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   do things.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.840]   He sells Christ for a few bucks, and then he ends up hanging himself out of guilt.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.920]   Now we would think that we're sophisticated enough to recognize if somebody who is possessed
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.240]   by the devil, that we would be able to recognize.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.360]   I don't think we will.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.880]   I don't think it's that simple, because the disciples didn't.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:42.160]   When Jesus said that one of you are going to betray me, nobody knew.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.040]   They looked at each other, it's like, "Could it be me?
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.580]   Could it be me?"
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.560]   And when Jesus pointed them out, they were surprised because nobody knew.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.320]   As sophisticated as they were, they were with Christ for three years, and they couldn't
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.180]   tell when somebody was satanically possessed.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:05.000]   But the real danger for genuine Christian is not possession, because we can't be possessed
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.760]   because the Holy Spirit isn't dwelling in us.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:18.900]   But Peter, a leader among the apostles, who was a believer, comes to Jesus and he says,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.860]   he begins to rebuke him and tell him, "You can't go to the cross.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.860]   How can you go to the cross?"
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.660]   Remember what Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.860]   Jesus recognized immediately that this was satanic influence.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.140]   It wasn't satanic possession, but it was satanic influence.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:39.220]   The reason why he was susceptible to this satanic influence was because he was obsessed
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.980]   with his own ambition.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.620]   Remember when Jesus was heading to the cross?
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.580]   He was telling them, "I'm going to go and they're going to beat me.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.620]   They're going to crucify me and I'm going to be raised."
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.920]   And he keeps telling them that, and every time he tells them that, the disciples are
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.060]   arguing with each other, "Well, afterwards when the kingdom is set up, who's going to
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.560]   be the greatest?
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   Is it going to be James?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   Is it going to be me?"
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360]   And it was almost like they didn't hear him.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.700]   "Okay, okay, you do what you got to do, but when you establish the kingdom, who's going
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700]   to be the greatest?"
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:17.380]   And there's a reason why on the last day at the communion table, he humbles himself and
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.180]   he says, "You do the same," because he knew what they were wrestling with.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.220]   If you really want to be great in the kingdom of God, you do what I do now, humble yourself.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:33.380]   See, that was the problem with Apostle Peter, a great man, the leader among the disciples,
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.700]   but he was self-ambitious.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.580]   And as a result of that, he's telling, he's rebuking Jesus and saying, "You can't let
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.580]   this happen."
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.580]   He said, "No, you're going to fail me."
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:48.140]   He said, "Even if they all fail you, I won't fail you."
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.980]   Satanic influence in our lives is dangerous, and that's why Paul says to pay very close
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   attention.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:00.580]   Paul tells Timothy, 2 Timothy 2, 4, "Watch your life and doctrine carefully.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.380]   Watch your life and your doctrine carefully, because you can be deceived by doctrine, you
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.700]   can be deceived in your life."
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.460]   Thinking that we are pursuing Christ all the while, seeking the glory, just like Apostle
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.540]   Peter and the others.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.500]   We want God to be glorified, because when he gets glorified, I will get glorified with
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.500]   him.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.620]   And as a result of that, he was satanically influenced to prevent him to go to the cross.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.480]   We are commanded to test every spirit.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.340]   We are commanded to test every spirit.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.340]   First John 4, 1, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirit to see whether
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.340]   they are from God."
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.540]   Well, what is he talking about testing the spirit?
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.140]   Are there some ghosts, you know what I mean, supernatural ghosts going around and saying,
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.140]   "Oh, that's not from God.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.140]   He's black."
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.140]   Right?
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.980]   "Oh, this must be from God, because he's white."
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   Right?
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.620]   Well, what does he mean to test the spirit?
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.300]   He's talking about people.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.340]   He's talking about people who are coming in and saying that they're speaking for God.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.660]   He's talking about people who are teaching, who are influencing people.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:17.620]   He said, "Test to see if they are really from God, because many false prophets have gone
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.860]   out into the world."
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:25.060]   Now, we don't have a count of how many false prophets there are.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:30.220]   All we know is the Bible keeps repeating over and over again that many have gone out, many
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.220]   have gone out.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:38.700]   So we don't know how many false prophets there are versus true prophets, but we can guess
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.780]   by looking at the Old Testament.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.660]   Because in the Old Testament, the predominant number of people who are saying that they
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.860]   were speaking for God were false prophets.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.980]   We know how many true prophets we had, because they wrote books.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.980]   God speaks about them.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.020]   Their names are mentioned.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.000]   We don't know how many false prophets there were, but we know that they outnumbered the
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.440]   true prophets.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.500]   We don't know by how many, by hundreds, by thousands, but we know that they were the
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.500]   majority.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.340]   Because every time a true prophet would speak and say, "Repent from your sins," a false
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.140]   prophet would rise up and say, "Don't listen to that guy."
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.380]   Why would God be angry with us?
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:26.540]   And every single prophet in the Old Testament, there is a false prophet nullifying his message.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.800]   And people are willing or wanting to easily go and follow them because they are giving
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.680]   the message that they want to hear.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.620]   And I think it is the same today.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.620]   Based upon what we know of the Old Testament, there are more false prophets today than there
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.620]   are right prophets.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.620]   Revelation chapter 2.2.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.340]   Again, this is all over Scripture.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.340]   This is not just in Romans.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.180]   This is not just in Corinthians.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.900]   This is not just in Ephesus.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.620]   It's not just in the New Testament.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.700]   All over Scripture.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:07.660]   This letter that is written to the church of Ephesus, that they're concerned because
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.300]   they become lukewarm, but he says there's one thing that he does commend.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.620]   "I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance and that you cannot tolerate even men and
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:21.140]   you put to test those who call themselves apostles and they are not and you found them
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.140]   to be false."
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.460]   He commends them.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.900]   Before he rebukes them, he said, "This is one thing you're doing right.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.420]   You're not just accepting it because you just like this guy or he's charismatic."
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.980]   I mean, why would he be telling false teachings?
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.340]   He said he tested them.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.340]   Acts 17.11.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.900]   This is where our church name is based on, Bereans.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:49.060]   Pastor Paul comes from this church of Thessalonica, which he calls in his letter a model church.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.940]   And yet he says this Berean that's only mentioned in passing, he said, "They were more noble
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:00.540]   minded," verse 11, "than those Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness,
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.860]   examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.340]   They didn't just accept it because Apostle Paul said it.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:13.620]   They said they put the word of God above him and they were testing him to see if this was
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   a man of God or not.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.700]   He was testing the spirit.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.320]   Now none of these things are new to you.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.680]   We know it to be true.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.380]   Maybe that's the reason why you chose to come to Berean.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.900]   You came to Berean because you wanted to come to a church that's going to take the word
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.420]   of God seriously.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   You wanted to study Leviticus, which a lot of your friends are probably thinking, "You're
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   weird.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.640]   You're not a Leviticus.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.240]   You study Revelation and Isaiah?"
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.380]   But maybe you came here because you wanted to know.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:55.960]   But let me ask you, how did you come to the conclusion of the doctrine of Trinity?
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:04.880]   How many of you can defend the doctrine of Trinity with the word of God?
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.360]   And yet we are adamant that I will never go to a church that does not teach anything but
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.280]   the right doctrine of Trinity.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.480]   How did you come to that conclusion?
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.240]   Did you come to that conclusion because you were convicted and you searched the word of
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   God to see if this is what it was taught?
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.440]   Or the community that you belong to told you that you can't believe in modalism, you can't
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:33.860]   believe in tritheism, that the correct doctrine is the Trinity.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.080]   How did you come to that conclusion and why are you so convinced that that's the right
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.780]   view?
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:44.000]   Why not the Jehovah Witnesses, where they believe in tritheism, that Christ is just
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.580]   a God, not the God?
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.860]   Why not modalism, where they're just one person called three separate names?
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.960]   How did you come to the conclusion and why are you so convinced that that's the right
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.080]   doctrine?
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.740]   How about justification by faith and faith alone?
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740]   Why not works?
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.200]   Because humanly speaking, it makes sense that you earn some part of your salvation, but
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.860]   yet the Bible says it's justification by faith alone and you add works to that is no longer
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.420]   the gospel.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.540]   We all know that, but how did you come to that conclusion?
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.060]   Who did you trust?
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.820]   Which leader are you deferring to?
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.160]   What church did you refer, defer your walk with God?
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.660]   If they said it, it must be true.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:37.980]   It is not enough to attend a Bible teaching church because I could be wrong.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.740]   How do you know if I'm not teaching false doctrine?
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.500]   Whether we know it or not, we all of us suddenly have confidence in things that we shouldn't
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.140]   have confidence in.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.700]   Maybe there's a pastor that you like and if he says it, it has a lot more weight.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.540]   Maybe it's a denomination that you're loyal to.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:02.060]   Well, we're Presbyterian so we believe this or we're Baptist so we believe this and this
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.060]   is what I was taught.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.380]   This is what my parents said.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:09.940]   And so we have all of these things, but we kind of loosely hold on to them.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:17.380]   So our confidence is in people and not in God's word, not in God himself.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.700]   So when you fall into trouble, when you have problems, you have a tendency, well, I can't
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.740]   trust this guy, so who do I trust?
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.220]   And then you're looking for someone else to trust.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.300]   Maybe you shouldn't have trusted that person to begin with.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.400]   Maybe our confidence shouldn't be in man to begin with.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:41.240]   He says many false prophets have gone, many of them, and they're in our midst within the
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.620]   Christian circles who have the Bible open, maybe even expositing the scripture, and maybe
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:55.800]   they're not wrong all the time, but they are not God.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:04.740]   Part of the reason why there is superficial application of the gospel message is because
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.420]   there's superficial conviction of the gospel.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.440]   If you live in your Christian bubble, you have no idea what kind of holes you have in
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.060]   your theology.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.520]   You have no idea what makes sense and doesn't make sense because we kind of sit in our Christian
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.100]   bubble and we affirm each other.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.820]   Yes, the Trinity.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.780]   Yes, Bible exposition.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.180]   Yes, community.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.620]   Yes, missions.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:34.220]   And we kind of like bounce off ideas with each other, but as soon as you sit with an
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:40.140]   antagonist and he said, "Well, how do you know the Bible is God's word?"
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.180]   I just do.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.560]   So much of our testimony, and again, in and of itself, it's not false, but so many of
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.620]   our testimony is, you know, I wasn't taking my faith seriously, and then I went to school,
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.580]   and then this guy, you know, who was really friendly to me, and I met him on campus, and
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:04.500]   then he invited me to CCM or KCM or wherever campus, and I really enjoyed the small group.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.580]   They really helped me to really take my faith seriously, and then that led me to Berean,
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.620]   and then eventually I became a Christian.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.940]   And that's how I know that this is true.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.540]   You know how many Buddhists I've talked to who give me that same story?
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.460]   I had this guy who was a Buddhist when I was young in my life, and he was really invested
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.340]   in my life, and he took me to the temple, and I really loved these people.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:35.460]   They really were generous people, were honest, and I just wanted to be in this community,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   you know?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.300]   And then eventually that's how I became a Buddhist.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.420]   Well, how did you become a Mormon?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.580]   You know, when I was young, I met these guys at school, and they seemed to be really serious
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.020]   about their faith, and it was unlike other Christians that I've seen.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:56.380]   And so they invited me to their church, and we were having fellowship, and we were sharing
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:03.140]   meals, and man, they really were moral, upright people.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.980]   And so I knew that that was true.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:12.380]   The problem with that testimony is that you can repeat that in any religion.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.340]   Like, I've experienced it.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.060]   These people were great, so I gave myself in there.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.700]   I started trusting what they had to say, and so therefore this is what I believe.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:25.260]   But the problem with that is that that will never lead to utter transformation.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:30.260]   Where Apostle Paul was willing to die for this message, that testimony will kind of
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:35.660]   lead you to the church, because what attracted you was these good people.
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.400]   So you will never move beyond these good people.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.660]   But the gospel calls us beyond that.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.800]   Apostle Paul gave his life.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.620]   Every one of those apostles were so convicted, they left everything that they knew, and they
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.260]   followed Christ.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:35:00.300]   Everything that they knew became rubbish in light of this conviction that this was real.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.220]   This was not just a theory.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.020]   This wasn't just going to make your marriage better.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:11.100]   All that we know is under the condemnation because of sin.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.340]   And as a result of that, he says he's going to come and redeem us.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.900]   We're going to have eternity with him, and everybody who does not confess and wash in
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.420]   the blood of Christ is going to be condemned.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.660]   That's the gospel message.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:32.660]   How can that gospel message only lead us to be good people in the church?
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.020]   That's why the Bible keeps telling us to be sober and watchful, and why he's so harsh
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.740]   on lukewarmness, because lukewarm Christian is somebody who's not watching.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.340]   He's like, "You know, there's a thief that's going to come into your house, and you kind
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.780]   of like leave the door open.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.020]   You sleep like any other day."
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.980]   And he didn't say he might come.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.100]   He says he's coming.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.340]   See, people will look at the church and say, "Well, how do we trust him?"
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.540]   So if you attend a large conference or if you go to meetings where people are introduced,
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.140]   they'll say, "Well, he wrote so many books, and he's so influential.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.700]   He's a pastor of this large church over here.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   Look at all these experiences.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.460]   He's a very successful businessman, and he's a man who is respected in the community, and
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.700]   so therefore you need to listen to him."
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.380]   But the problem with all of that is all of that can be mimicked.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.700]   All of that can be satanic.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.560]   You don't think Satan can help somebody to have a successful business?
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.700]   You don't think there are charismatic people who are very articulate that is being used
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.700]   by Satan?
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:50.020]   Look at the credential the Apostle Paul gives them.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:56.200]   In 2 Corinthians 11, 23 to 27, he is wrestling with his church because they're questioning
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.500]   his apostleship because they didn't like what he had to say.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:06.540]   But the credential he gives is very different than the credential we give in our generation.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.620]   Are they servants of Christ?
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.940]   I speak as if insane.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.540]   I more so in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number,
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.060]   often in danger of death.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.460]   Five times I received from the Jews 39 lashes.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460]   Three times I was beaten with rods.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.460]   Once I was stoned.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:27.140]   Three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.020]   I have been on frequent journeys in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.900]   from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.700]   danger in the sea, danger among the false brethren.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.340]   I have been in labor and hardship through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.580]   often without food and cold and exposure.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.260]   Apart from such external things, there is a daily pressure on me of concern for all
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   the churches.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.620]   This is his credential.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.080]   He doesn't talk about his great learning.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.600]   He didn't talk about how he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.140]   He doesn't talk about how he was a former member of the Sanhedrin.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:07.540]   He doesn't talk about his great heritage of a Roman citizenship.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.220]   He talks about his beating, his suffering.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.140]   Why does he do that?
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:23.980]   Because unless a man is so deeply convicted that this is the truth, he won't give his
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.260]   life.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.140]   If he's seeking his glory, what benefit is there in the beating?
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.780]   If he's doing it for selfish motive, what benefit is there for being shipwrecked?
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.660]   What benefit is there with the whipping?
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.460]   What benefit is there for going hungry?
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:47.040]   What benefit is there for leaving everything and then ultimately getting beheaded?
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.180]   So what Apostle Paul is pointing to is his faith.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   Because I believe.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:57.460]   And that's why what James says in James chapter 1, "Consider pure joy when you encounter
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:04.020]   trials of many kinds, because the testing of your faith produces endurance."
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:10.460]   And when endurance has its perfect result, it causes you to be perfect and complete,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.620]   not lacking anything.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.620]   And all of it for the purpose of what?
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.340]   Testing of your faith.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.400]   Do you believe this?
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.340]   How did you come to the conclusion, the things that you profess to believe?
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.500]   Is it just a group think tank?
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.020]   It's because you were born in a Christian home?
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.220]   You were surrounded by Christians who told you?
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.460]   And because you like them, you said, "I want to believe what they want to believe."
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.020]   Not necessarily because you are convicted of it as being true.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:43.760]   If your faith is a group faith that you've adhered to because you like these people,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.260]   you will never move beyond the people that you are around.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.220]   So if they are lukewarm, you will be lukewarm.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.960]   If they are disobedient, you will be disobedient.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.020]   You will never move beyond where the crowd is.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.740]   Because that's how you came to faith.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.420]   You wanted to be part of that group.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:11.100]   But when God calls you and He wants to challenge you, He wants to use you, what does God always
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.020]   do with His people?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.420]   He takes them away and sends them out to the desert.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.040]   He makes them by themselves alone with God.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.500]   And they have this communion with God that they didn't have in the group.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.780]   God always does that.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:34.900]   He will isolate you so that you can see how much of your faith is real and how much of
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.580]   it is you're just going along with the crowd.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:45.100]   You just happen to be at Berean, so you're going on with the Bible crowd.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.380]   You just happen to be at a church that does missions, so you're going along with that
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.580]   crowd.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.860]   That's why He says to stay sober.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:02.060]   He wants us to judge, to come to our own conclusion that Jesus died for me, but am I willing to
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.120]   die for Him?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.480]   Is this something that I am convicted?
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.900]   Is this precious?
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.660]   He says even in Epaphroditus in Philippians chapter 229, "Receive Him then in the Lord
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:21.260]   with all joy and hold men like Him in high regard because He came close to death."
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.500]   He said that's His credential.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.980]   It's not the many books that He's read.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.960]   It's not the books that He's written.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.340]   It's not the large church that He has.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.820]   He said He almost died because He was so convicted.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   In Deuteronomy chapter 13, 1 through 4, it gives instructions on how to determine if
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.580]   a prophet is truly from God or not.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.940]   It's two criteria.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.100]   One, does it come true?
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.380]   If they prophesize something, it doesn't come true.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.140]   Immediately it's not from God.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.940]   He doesn't say, "Well, if it doesn't come to fruition the first time, give it a second
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.100]   time.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.300]   Try three or four times and maybe one of those times will stick."
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   He said, "No."
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:08.340]   If He says it and it doesn't happen, I didn't send Him because that's not how God works.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.220]   God doesn't send people and say, "Oh, he got it wrong four or five times.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.220]   Maybe the fifth time if he tries it, keep trying it and you'll get it right."
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.340]   He says, "No."
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.980]   That's why He tells Moses, "Oh, you're sending the wrong guy.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.980]   I'm not good."
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.500]   He doesn't say, "You humble servant of mine."
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.540]   He said, "You're arrogant.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.940]   You think I chose you because I needed you?
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.360]   I made your mouth.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.980]   When I tell you to open it, just open it.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.620]   When I tell you to shut it, just shut it."
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.380]   He didn't say, "You are humble for refusing Him."
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.460]   He said, "Arrogant.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.700]   You're just a tool."
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.500]   If He says something, it doesn't come true.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   He's not from God.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:53.180]   But secondly, if He says it and it comes true and yet He doesn't lead you to God, He's not
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   from me.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:01.980]   In other words, the miracles can be mimicked by Satan and we see that even in the 10 plagues.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.500]   Every time God performs a miracle, there's another miracle that matches.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.500]   Well, we can do this.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   Well, you can do that.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:13.780]   We can do this and back and forth until finally God does something that they can't mimic.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.980]   But this false prophet happened to mimic and yet He does not lead you to God.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.860]   He's not from God.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.180]   But let me conclude with this.
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:29.060]   Because the greatest problem in our generation is not necessarily blatant heresy.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.820]   Satan does not come dressed as Satan.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:40.620]   Satan comes scheming, putting thoughts in your head while you're not paying attention,
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:46.140]   your own dissensions, your own desires that are frustrated and Satan gives you a way to
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.820]   have him and the world at the same time, which will never happen because the Bible says you
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.180]   can't have the world and God at the same time and yet because you filled your heart with
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.620]   the things of this world, you end up gravitating toward doctrines and teaching that will allow
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:06.260]   you to have both, which ultimately isn't from God.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:13.180]   Our problem today isn't necessarily blatant heresy because we can recognize that.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.980]   We're not fighting against people who are saying, "I don't believe in God."
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.540]   It's like, "Well, are there people there?"
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.780]   Of course.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.380]   Jesus was not resurrected from the dead.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.340]   Of course there are people who are like that.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.360]   But what destroys the church is not that.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.540]   What destroys the church is gradual erosion of a church that does not believe in the sufficiency
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.820]   of God's Word.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.180]   We believe in inerrancy but not sufficiency.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:45.500]   What I mean by that is we use the Word of God almost like a decoration.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.740]   We have it, we memorize scripture, we read books about it, but when we're really in trouble,
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.300]   we look for counselors.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.980]   There's nothing wrong with counseling.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:02.820]   But the first solution to any problem that we have is look to other people.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:08.740]   Before we come to His Word, before we come to prayer, you are in danger and you don't
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.760]   even know it.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:19.780]   If we have more confidence in leadership than the Word of God, you are in more danger than
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.860]   you think you are.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.220]   If you are more comforted by the people that surround you and says encouraging things to
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:40.580]   you, than the words of God Himself, you are in danger much more than you think you are.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:45.740]   Because you are open to deception.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.780]   You have no way of testing if this is really from God.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.900]   You want it to be from God.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.180]   There's been a lot of studies about how Diet Coke is not good for you.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.700]   And some of you guys are never going to drink Diet Coke.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:06.020]   And I've read the studies myself, I've heard it, and many of you have told me that.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.380]   But I don't believe it.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.260]   I don't believe it.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:16.180]   And the reason why I don't believe it is because I don't want to believe it.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.140]   Because it's good.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:26.820]   Especially when you're eating like spicy food or actually pretty much any food.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.020]   I can't refute the study.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.020]   I don't know why.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.580]   I just don't want to believe it.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.420]   Because I don't want to give it up.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.780]   So don't confront me.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.420]   I'm trying to drink less of it.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:47.580]   But automatically my natural instinct is like, "Who did this study?"
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.340]   It's got to be Pepsi.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.820]   Pepsi must have done this study.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.540]   She said, "So good.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.740]   Why would it be bad for you?
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.180]   I've been drinking it for years.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.740]   I'm fine."
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:07.020]   How much of our doctrines do we embrace because it is convenient?
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:13.540]   How much of the doctrines do we have a knee-jerk reaction against because it is inconvenient?
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:23.340]   When we are lukewarm and we are not sober, you set yourself up for deception.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:31.620]   That's why the Bible says, "Test," Proverbs 3, 5, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.340]   and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.460]   Do not be wise in your own eyes.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.620]   Fear the Lord and turn away from evil."
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.460]   Don't trust your own intellect.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.620]   Don't trust the people around you.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.580]   That's going to be our main point today.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.380]   Don't trust anybody.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.420]   After the first sermon, somebody came up to me.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.740]   He's like, "Thank you for the sermon.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.900]   I'm not going to trust anybody."
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:01.100]   I was like, "Yeah, high five."
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:07.620]   I was like, "Huh, maybe I should speak to her."
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.860]   I'm not saying don't be skeptical.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.740]   It's like, "Who are you?"
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:19.740]   Make sure that our confidence is coming from the truth, not because of charismatic personalities,
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.540]   not because of credentials, not because of your experience, not because, "Well, that
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.020]   man is so venerated by so many people.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.020]   He can't be wrong."
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:33.180]   You don't know how many times I've had discussions with people about doctrine and say, "Well,
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.180]   it's like this."
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.540]   They say, "Well, where did you find that in Scripture?"
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.460]   And I say, "Well, he said this in this article and this denomination, but where did you find
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.460]   it in Scripture?"
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.220]   And they can't defend it.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.580]   So, how did you come to that conclusion?
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:53.100]   I said, "Well, even they didn't realize that they were just deferring to whoever that they
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.100]   honored.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.300]   It is not safe."
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:04.820]   Whether that is John Piper or John MacArthur or, again, all the Johns, right?
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.980]   It is not safe.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.060]   Let me conclude with one more passage.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:16.200]   In Luke chapter 5, Jesus is calling his disciples.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.280]   He spends a good chunk of time teaching the multitude, and then he sees the disciples
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.300]   coming from a long night of fishing, unsuccessful.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.740]   In verse 4, "When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 'Put out into the deep
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.940]   water and let down your nets for a catch.'
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:36.940]   Simon answered and said, 'Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing.'"
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.660]   So, stop right there.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.220]   These are professional fishermen who caught nothing.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.560]   They spent all night at the prime time of fishing.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.540]   They caught nothing, and here is this carpenter, and he said, "Oh, you didn't catch anything?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.540]   Try it one more time."
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.540]   Right?
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:57.860]   Now, I am just reading in between the line, and I am thinking, humanly speaking, and again,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.900]   I don't think Peter was just an average fisherman.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:05.220]   I don't think he was an electrician, and then at the age of 30, decided, "Ah, it's not working
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.220]   for me.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.220]   I am going to be a fisherman."
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:12.380]   According to Scripture, it says that he owned his own boat, so he wasn't just an average
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380]   fisherman.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.380]   He was a guy who was able to hire other people to fish for him.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.620]   And you know, when that paralytic was being lowered down when Jesus was preaching, many
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.580]   people believed that that was his mother's house.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.820]   And so, this was not a small house.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.020]   This was a pretty big house to have a gathering there of that size.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.740]   So Peter was a middle to upper middle class fisherman.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.620]   So these were pretty wealthy guys.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:41.700]   And so, which means that he was probably a fisherman by trade, by generation.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:46.060]   My guess is his great-grandfather was a fisherman, grandfather was a fisherman, father was a
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.940]   fisherman, and he is the fisherman, maybe third, fourth, fifth generation fisherman.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.940]   He knows what he is doing.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.300]   Everything he knew, he knew from an infant.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:02.300]   And all the other guys on the boat are in the same boat, basically.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   Where is Dean?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.980]   Dean would appreciate that.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.180]   They were on the same boat.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:14.220]   So when Jesus says, "After all night of fishing, throw the net out," I could read between
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:23.260]   the line and he is thinking, "If I need a chair to be fixed, I will call you, Jesus."
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:28.620]   If the walls need to be painted or shelves need to be put up, I will call you.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.820]   I am the professional fisherman.
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:40.220]   "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but," it's a big but.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.980]   There is a lot of big buts in the Bible.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:48.140]   "But I will do as you say and let down the net."
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.180]   I don't think Peter would have listened to anybody else but Jesus because he is the expert
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.860]   in this.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:00.180]   If Matthew said to the tax collector, "Hey, you caught all night, try one more time,"
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.620]   I think his response would have been, "Jump out of the boat and start choking him."
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.860]   Like all night he is frustrated, they didn't catch anything.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.660]   These are professional fishermen who couldn't catch anything and just flipping it.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.980]   "Hey, just try one more time.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.300]   You are a tax collector.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.500]   If I want to rip off people, I will call you, okay?
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.900]   Don't tell me what to do."
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.620]   But he says, "Because you say it.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.420]   Because you say it, I will do it."
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:37.020]   When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish and their nets began to break.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.380]   Now these are professional fishermen.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.100]   I don't think that they bought their nets from the 99 cent store, that this was some
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.100]   weak net.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:47.580]   And so the first time they get a large catch that it starts breaking.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.460]   That's how much fish that they caught.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.220]   And my guess is they never caught something this big.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.860]   And they were having a hard time even bringing it up.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.660]   So they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:04.280]   And they came and filled both of the boats so that they began to sink.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.260]   I don't think they probably ever experienced this.
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.100]   I don't think they did this and then look back and say, "Yeah, this happens every other
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.100]   week."
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:15.820]   We are professional fishermen, did it all night, couldn't catch anything, but because
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.860]   you say so, we'll do it.
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:23.500]   And as a result of that, their nets break and boats begin to sink, filled with fish.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.820]   This is not by accident.
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:28.140]   Jesus isn't showing off.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:35.580]   He's trying to teach his disciples, "Do not turn from my word to the left or to the right."
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:42.020]   If you want to have success, do not rely upon your intellect.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.980]   Do not rely upon your experience.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.580]   Do not rely upon your gifting.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.140]   Do not rely upon people.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.060]   Do not rely upon leadership.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.980]   Don't rely upon your church.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:54:01.560]   If you want to bear fruit, abide in me, me.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:07.900]   Do not turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:14.460]   This is the same warning that God gave to the Israelites.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.340]   Your power is not within you, it's me.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.540]   So when I tell you to open your mouth, open it.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.300]   When I tell you to shut it, shut it.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.620]   When I tell you to walk, you walk.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.100]   When I tell you to stop, you stop.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.000]   And he says the same thing in the New Testament.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.220]   When I tell you to watch, watch.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.820]   Be sober because they're coming.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.620]   And their intent is to destroy you.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:54.820]   And when you are deceived and you are destroyed, you don't even know it.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.260]   That's what deception is.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.620]   There might be satanic influence in your life and you just think like, "Ah, I'm not taking
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.980]   my faith seriously."
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:12.140]   You might not realize there's satanic work happening in your life because you're not
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.060]   taking it seriously.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:22.860]   This is why lukewarmness is so, so, so, so, so dangerous.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.500]   We're not on a picnic.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.900]   We're not sightseeing.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:34.740]   The Bible says we are in the spiritual warfare to be nonchalant in the context of bullets
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:41.180]   flying at us is a very dangerous place for us to be.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.940]   That's why he says watch.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:52.100]   Watch, keep an eye out for those who are coming in to hinder and to destroy.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.100]   It's not a might.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.180]   He says it is.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:06.060]   Let me, as I invite our praise team to come, let me ask you, encourage you, examine your
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.060]   faith.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:11.340]   And my goal here this morning is not to shake you up and question your faith ultimately,
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.060]   but it really is to strengthen you.
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:20.260]   Because so much of Christianity that you and I have become accustomed to is cultural and
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.180]   is not truth.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:28.460]   We're okay as long as we fit in with whatever Christian community that I've adapted myself
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.740]   into.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.680]   Our standard of righteousness cannot be the church.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.780]   It must be the word of God.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.240]   And I'm going to go a step further than that.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:51.100]   If you follow Christ out of genuine conviction of this truth, there will be times when God
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.140]   will separate you from this group.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.700]   He will send you abroad.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:05.100]   He will send you some other places, and maybe even within the church to force you to take
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.540]   a look at your faith, to see where you stand.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:20.540]   Because until our faith is fortified and strengthened, we are vulnerable.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:26.820]   Let's take some time to pray, come before God, examining our own selves, praying, "Lord,
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:27.820]   we pray.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:28.820]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:32.540]   See if there's things that I've just kind of assumed in my life and never really questioned.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.220]   Do I really believe this?
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.500]   And if I really believe this, where do I stand?
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.580]   Is my confidence coming from my tradition?
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.940]   Is my confidence coming from the church or certain people that I've deferred my faith
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:49.300]   to or is it coming from you knowing who God is?"
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:57.860]   Be confident that strays from Christ and His Word, we are in danger.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.900]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
