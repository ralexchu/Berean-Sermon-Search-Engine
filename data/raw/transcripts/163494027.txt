[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew 28 verses 1 through 10
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:13.400]   Matthew 28 verses 1 through 10 and then we'll jump into the message today
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:23.940]   Now after the Sabbath toward the dawn of the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.760]   and
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.720]   Behold there was a great earthquake for an angel the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.120]   His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow and for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.880]   But the angel said to the woman do not be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.380]   He is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where he lay
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.080]   Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he's gone before you to Galilee there
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.440]   You will see him see I have told you
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.560]   so they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples and
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.240]   Behold Jesus met them and said greetings and they came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.880]   Then Jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee and there they will see me
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   Let's pray
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   Heavenly
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.820]   Father we thank you for your blessing of allowing us to come and worship this morning
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.520]   We pray that you would again soften our hearts that your word would go forth and will not return until it has accomplished its purpose
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.940]   We pray Lord God that the power of the resurrection the power of the resurrected life would deeply affect us
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.080]   Help us to understand the gift of salvation that you've given that we may truly surrender our lives Lord God in light of what you've given
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.520]   So we ask for your grace and your Holy Spirit to guide us in Jesus name. We pray. Amen
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.560]   Let me start out this morning by asking you a simple question
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.720]   Are you happy?
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.040]   Yeah, you don't have to say anything just kind of ask yourself are you happy
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.480]   You know, I probably don't have to ask you that you probably ask yourself that pretty often
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.440]   You probably ask yourself. Are you happy in this relationship?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.880]   Are you happy at work? Are you happy at the present circumstance that you're in?
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.720]   Because that's a question that we commonly ask because all of us in some sense one or a or the other one Avenue or another
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.960]   We want to be happy. So if we're not happy, we will change our circumstance
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.920]   Sometimes we will change relationships and we'll change jobs based upon how we answer that question
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.480]   I'm not happy here. So something needs to change
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.640]   You know and I know I kind of tend to pick on Disneyland because we're close to Disneyland
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   But you know like I I'm not a huge Disneyland fan because it gets a thought of going there just kind of tires me out
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   But I know some of you guys, you know, you love Disneyland. So you guys have year-round passes and you know, I
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.520]   They sell themselves at least in marketing saying it is the what place on earth
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.280]   You know it come on
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   Happiest place that's how they sell it. They sell why is this place the happiest place on earth?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   And I think what is the attraction right? I think it gives people a temporary break from reality
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.160]   You know, you're tired at work
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.760]   Maybe you're having some struggles financial whatever it may be when you go to Disneyland is temporarily
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   You're taken out of your life and then you go to fantasy land you go to children land
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   You go to Batman land, whatever this they have, right?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320]   and then it
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   Temporarily takes you out of real life and then places in a place where you just forget about all of that
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.400]   And when you feel happy because they're spending million billions of dollars
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.960]   Even just so that you can be even if it's just temporary to make you happy and people are willing to shell out money
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.720]   You know say oh my gosh, you went up used to be I remember when it was the cheapest like 35 bucks
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.320]   I hear it's 150 bucks to get in, you know, I say oh my gosh. I can't believe they raised it
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.480]   You know, but we'll go right
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   We'll go we'll shell out the money because that temporary escape is worth it
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.680]   But here's the next question
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.720]   Now when we think about our happiness
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.860]   How do you feel about your relationship with God
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.560]   Does that cause a sense of joy or do we see
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.760]   Church and your walk with God the way we sometimes we look at work
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   No
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.640]   We go to Disneyland and we do all this other stuff and travel and look at things and eat and experience different things
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.520]   But church is just something you do because that's what you're supposed to go
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   Right. This is what Christians do
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   So it is not as your relationship with Christ isn't a source of joy instead. It's just you're supposed to do
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.800]   I mean Jesus died for me. So how can I not worship him? But is it really a source of joy?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   Is that where you run to to seek happiness?
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.320]   You know if we're not careful we can easily think that Christianity is of all about the cross and death
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   Which in essence it is, you know, don't don't go out make from this quote mean saying oh he said he says not about the cross
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.440]   right and
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.480]   Understandably even the symbol that represents Christianity is the symbol of death the cross
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.040]   And so the mistake that we can make is to think that everything is about his death and his suffering
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.960]   Not realizing the scripture makes it very clear that the point of Christianity is about life
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.080]   And the reason why Christ came is so that we may have life
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   He says in John chapter 10 10
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.360]   I have come that they may have life and to have it to the full that you may have this life abundantly
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.120]   Again in Romans 6 3 as we celebrate the resurrection of Christ and why this is so central
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.480]   To everything that we you and I confess and believe do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus?
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   We're baptized into his death
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.360]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.200]   That just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. We too might walk in the newness of life
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.000]   Did you catch that?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.320]   He said the whole point of the cross the whole point of union with Christ in his death is in order
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.200]   That we may be also raised in glory to a new life
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.940]   So the whole point of Friday was Sunday
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.640]   Let me say that again. The whole point of Friday was Sunday
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.240]   So if our Christian faith never brings us to Sunday and all we meditate and think about is about the suffering and the cross
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.160]   Then you miss the whole point of what the cross was about
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.840]   The whole point of the cross was to open the door that we may have this new life
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.040]   and
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   Just as pastor Mark shared and just as the scripture teaches us
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.120]   Resurrection life is at the core at the center of what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.260]   So this morning we want to talk about well if the whole point of Christianity is about life and this pursuit of life this new life
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.960]   How do we understand this life that the Bible teaches?
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.080]   In English, we use the word life to talk about life of the plant life of the animal
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.900]   You know or I feel alive we use one word to describe all of it
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.040]   What Greek is a lot more a lot more accurate than that
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.920]   the Greek actually has several words that describe the word life and and it's really important for us to understand the distinction because
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.120]   If you don't understand the distinction between these two particular words that I'm about to go through this morning
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.920]   You're gonna miss the whole point of Christianity. You can live your whole life quoting the same verses
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.360]   saying the same things
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   But completely missing the point just like you know, just because somebody says I believe in Jesus
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   It really depends who's saying that right if you're hearing that from the jovial witness says you hear that from the Mormons
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:00.400]   I mean you could say the name Jesus or even the Muslims their idea of Jesus is completely different
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.360]   So when the Bible talks about this word life that I have come to give life and give this life
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.640]   Abundantly if we don't accurately understand what he means by life
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.600]   You're gonna miss the whole point of what salvation is about
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.480]   Again there are more than two words
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.160]   But these two words pretty much summarize all the words that are used in the Bible of what life is
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.140]   The first word you probably heard it before is the word bios where we get the word biology
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.280]   It's talking about the quantity of life to put it simply. It's talking about the general physical life
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.760]   This word bios if all we have is bios
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   Sometimes we will call somebody and say, you know, maybe they're in a vegetative state or recently, you know
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   The zombie movies are very popular, you know zombies are
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.880]   Creatures or things that have no soul the basically
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.800]   They're not really living. They're just instinctively. They smell you they see you they just go at it, whatever it is, right?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.040]   So if all it is is on me
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   It's just this physical life and there's nothing more
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   Then it's just all about instinct like the Bible describes the loss of the eyes a loss of the flesh and boastful pride of life
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:21.960]   There's a whole book in the Bible that's dedicated in in a man who pursued bios
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.520]   like life in in the context of of just this flesh I
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.720]   Think you guys know what I'm talking about the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.400]   The whole book of Ecclesiastes is a man named Solomon who was the king of Israel known to be the wisest man on earth
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.000]   During his period of reign
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   Israel probably was the richest so he had money as a king. He's not like the president of the United States
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.920]   I mean, he's a king. I mean he could he had riches beyond
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.040]   That he could spend
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.880]   He had power because again he was the king, you know, most of us even if you win the lottery
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.200]   We are limited by opportunity. We're limited by politics
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.680]   We're limited even by our own wisdom. We may invest something foolish and then lose it in five six years
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.840]   This is a man who had all the wisdom all the power all the opportunity
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.160]   All the money and he committed himself
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.320]   to pursue life and
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.400]   This is what he says
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   Ecclesiastes 1 2 2 4
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Vanity vanity says the preacher he's referring to himself
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.520]   Vanity of vanities all is vanity and again in other translations. It means empty or vain useless
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.480]   At the end of it. He says all is vanity
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.760]   What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the Sun a generation goes and a generation comes
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   But the earth remains forever and that was that's basically the theme of the whole book of Ecclesiastes
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:55.160]   Here's a man who had every opportunity to pursue every pleasure on earth and his end conclusion is he found emptiness
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   Ecclesiastes 2 1 through 11. I said in my heart come now. I will test you with pleasure
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:08.560]   Enjoy yourself. In other words, he's saying like he didn't just decide to you know
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.040]   When when temptation came he determined to pursue every pleasure
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:21.400]   But behold this also was vanity. I said to set of laughter. It is mad, right? In other words, he pursued
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.400]   laughter
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.560]   you know a while back we did a
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   We did a dating seminar and we played this family feud game and we asked the sisters. What's your top?
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:39.160]   You know quality that you're looking for in your mate and the typical stuff came out, you know godly
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.320]   You know
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.800]   Dependable and all this, you know Christian answers that came out but was surprising to me
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   What was on the top of that list? A lot of you guys were there wasn't the top of that list
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.840]   Said the top number one answer that came out which is kind of surprising to me
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:07.160]   Was that they wanted a guy with a sense of humor and I couldn't understand why you know, I myself too
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.320]   I mean, you know part of the reason why I think Esther and I get along so well is because we laugh all the time
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.920]   Right, I tell jokes and if she if she didn't get it and she just stared at me. It's like ha ha ha
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.720]   Maybe it'd be a very hard relationship, right? So I get it, you know, but part of the thing about laughter is that
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.640]   You know again when is it temporary escape? It kind of makes everything feel a little bit better
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.080]   And he said he pursued laughter he says and it only made him mad
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.720]   Pleasure he pursued pleasure and he says at the end of it what uses it I
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.120]   Search with my heart how to cheer my body with wine
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.000]   Right. I mean it's one thing to drink a little wine with food and you know, I get little taste here and there
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.920]   But he said he pursued wine. He tried to drown
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.520]   His sorrows and temporary escape, you know
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.280]   Some people go to Disneyland and some people to travel some people eat some people pour themselves into alcohol
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.360]   He said I pursued it. So imagine I mean, this is the king
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.640]   he could get the finest wine and if he
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.600]   Abuses himself who's gonna say anything to the king?
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.560]   There was no limitation for him. He said I searched my heart to cheer my body with wine
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.760]   My heart still guiding me with wisdom in other words
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.880]   He didn't get carried away so that his life was ruined even in pursuit of of wine
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.560]   He said he did it within all of this within wisdom and how to lay hold on folly till I might see what was good for
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.440]   The children of man and to do under heaven during the few days of their life
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.120]   In other words anything that I can possibly think of I went after
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.480]   Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.960]   I kept my heart from no pleasure for my heart found pleasure in all of my toil and this was my reward for all of
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:58.160]   My toil then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expanded
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.680]   Expanding in doing it and behold
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.920]   All was vanity and striving after wind and there was nothing to be gained under the Sun
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:13.440]   Now this is probably nothing new to you. You know, you may read that and say, you know what? That's that's him
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.280]   That's his experience
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.120]   but how many times have you seen a movie star a
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.520]   someone in power of influence a CEO a
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.240]   sports star who
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.920]   Everybody else is looking up to and say, you know
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.600]   and I'm working hard so that one day I could be there and then you see them take their life and
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.240]   And say they're going through a depression
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.360]   like how can you be going through depression because we think the world thinks that that's where life is and
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.280]   It perplexes the world when they see something like that because wait a second
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.640]   If that's what we're pursuing and I'm looking at that guy who's there and he says it's not there
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.840]   You would think that people would say oh, maybe that's not it. He says I want to find this out for myself
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:02.820]   Paul says if the resurrection didn't happen and there is a new life and all it is is bios
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.320]   Why not just live this life to enjoy it?
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.680]   So what if at the end is vanity all it is is vanity. So what if this is it?
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.160]   But the answer to that is clear it is this is not it
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.140]   If you go to Disneyland and you pay a certain amount now, it's like 150 bucks, right?
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.720]   There's a limit to that
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.680]   So whether they close at 10 or 11 o'clock
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.880]   You're gonna milk every single bit of that place because you know, the closing time is coming
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   So you maybe you got there at 10 o'clock and you have 10 12 13 hours and the whole park is big enough
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:44.320]   Where you can spend every single minute doing something different and still not exhausted, you know, the end is coming
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.640]   So what do we do? We try to get as much in as possible
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.600]   Right and get in as many many, you know rides as you can go see as many shows eat as many churros
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.480]   You know visit as many parks
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.280]   I mean you you try to milk every ounce of energy that that you have for that purpose
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.760]   Well, that's what Paul says if we know the end is coming and this is it
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.880]   Drink have fun be merry if this is it
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.680]   So what if it's vanity?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.000]   But at the end of all of it we find that it is not it
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.280]   See the word bios is not the word that is described when Jesus says he has come to give life and give this life abundantly
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.680]   The word that is almost used exclusively in the New Testament
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.000]   Defining life is the word Zoe
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.660]   The Greek lexicon. Let me just read it straight out from the Greek lexicon the definition of this word
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.200]   It means to be alive
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.520]   The state of one who is possessed by vitality life of the absolute fullness of life both essential and ethical
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.000]   life real and genuine a life active and vigorous
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.560]   Cs Lewis in the book mere Christianity describes the distinction between bios and Zoe like this
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:09.200]   Bios is sort which come to us through nature and which like everything else in nature is always tending to run down and decay
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.400]   So that it can only be kept up by incessant subsidies from the nature in the form of air water food, etc
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.160]   In other words because bios is it cannot be maintained by itself
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.400]   It is it needs always something external to keep it alive that other external stuff like food
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:33.920]   Water, etc. The spiritual life which is in God from all eternity and which made the whole natural universe is Zoe
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.200]   Bios has to be sure a certain shadow or symbolic resemblance to Zoe
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   but only the sort of resemblance there is between a photo and a place a
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.720]   statue and a man a
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:53.600]   Man who changed from having bios to having Zoe would have gone through the big a change as a statue which changed from being a
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.000]   Carvestone to being a real man and that is precisely what Christianity is about
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.560]   Let me just kind of briefly summarize what he is saying
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.320]   He's saying the distinction between bios and Zoe is a distinction between
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.040]   living and existing
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.300]   See bios is the chronological life quantity of life and if we don't understand the word
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:24.680]   Life in his correct context. We just think that Jesus came to give eternal life eternal bios that we're just gonna exist
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.480]   If your life is miserable here, why would you want this for eternity?
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   So when we offer salvation as eternal life
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.320]   There's a lot of people with that that promise is not attractive. I
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.320]   Want this for eternity? I don't want this. I want at some point
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.520]   I want this misery to end if that's what salvation is to exist forever
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.280]   But that is not the teaching of the Bible
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:59.880]   When the scripture talks about life it is exclusively referring to Zoe to make us alive in Christ
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.440]   So let me read some of these verses. I'm not gonna give you the actual verses to save time
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.560]   But all these times sometimes you can read this without understanding just like you can you know, you know people say oh, I know Jesus
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   But it's their version of Jesus
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   So we talk about life a lot of times we understand our version of life, but let's re-understand in the context of Zoe
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.600]   That he came to bring us life make us alive
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.000]   right crown of Zoe
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.680]   crown of
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.860]   of life tree of Zoe
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.600]   the book of Zoe
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:43.200]   the water of Zoe the life and Zoe and godliness the Zoe of God
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.840]   Eternal Zoe
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.800]   Over and over again when the Bible talks about life. He's talking about making us alive
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.280]   Not simply existing
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.120]   see
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   ever since the fall of man
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.080]   People have been trying to find this life and isn't that why we do what we do a lot of things that we do
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.880]   We look for the weekend because we feel drudgery Monday through Friday and then we want to feel alive from Friday to Sunday
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.160]   So we fill our schedule with things that make us feel alive
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.880]   to recuperate
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   Some of us play golf
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.040]   Some of us go to amusement parks
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.400]   Some of us exercise whatever it may be
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.340]   We filled those days when we have the freedom and the money to do it so that we can feel alive
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.080]   But at the end of the day, it is only temporary and the park eventually closes
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   Exclusively
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:43.560]   When the Bible describes God and life it is only in the context of Zoe which makes sense
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.360]   Because God doesn't have physical form
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.920]   He is eternal one way or the other
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.320]   So in every instance the Bible talks about God and life it is in reference to Zoe
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.200]   Now since Zoe is unique to God
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.120]   We can't inherit Zoe
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.240]   You're not gonna you can't inherit Zoe because Zoe is uniquely God
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:13.800]   So we can reproduce bios like somebody who has flesh is another flesh and they have another
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.040]   Child and another bios is reproduced but Zoe is not something that we can go and reproduce
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:28.720]   Augustine is famous for one of his prayers that he says in describing this Zoe in God and he says Oh God
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.440]   You have created us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they rest in you
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:42.400]   This is not just a prayer of a Christian. This is a prayer of every human being
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.560]   Now we may say well, there's people who don't know Jesus. We've never heard the gospel. How can they ever say this prayer?
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.120]   Whether they're able to articulate this prayer or not
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.520]   Every human being that has been created
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   That has been separated from the Zoe
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.440]   Net will never find this rest this restlessness
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.560]   That is causing us to go to places do things experience things so that we may experience this Zoe
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.480]   As superficially as temporary as it may be
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.160]   this restlessness
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   In fact, you remember when God created Adam and Eve at the center of the Garden of Eden remember what he put?
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   tree of life
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.280]   Tree of life and that tree of life basically symbolized that Adam and Eve
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.600]   was made in the image of God and his always was put into him and
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.240]   Remember when the fall came God chases him out of gardener meeting and they restricted them to the Garden of Eden
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.440]   Where at the center was a tree of life
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.040]   The scripture says that Jesus came to restore life that was lost
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.200]   you know when somebody
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.760]   Passes and we want to see if somebody's act, you know has moved from move from this physical life to the next
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.400]   You know, one of the ways that we figure that out is their breath
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.880]   You know, I remember when my father was on his deathbed
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.680]   You know, we were all together. It was I think it was there - after after Thanksgiving
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.860]   So our family was together and we knew that my father was going to pass sometime that night
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.560]   And so me and my brothers we were watching Lakers basketball, you know on the side
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.200]   My dad was was sitting on his bed and you know, we sent the children home already, you know
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.060]   And we knew something was gonna happen that night and in the context of of just spending that night
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.040]   We knew that he was going to pass
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.800]   I was kind of watching basketball with one eye and watching my dad in the other eye and I could tell slowly
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.480]   That he was slipping the way that I could tell was his breathing just got slower and slower and slower and at one point
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.040]   And it was just in the context of us, you know
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.640]   Just three brothers just watching Lakers and in the middle of that I tapped my brothers and I said hey
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.400]   dad passed and
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   We all looked and says his chest out moving. There's no more breath in him
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:05.600]   That's how we determine if somebody is passed away because there's no longer any breath and I know that the scripture says life is in the blood
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.360]   But how do we know that that blood is providing life? It's through the breath of man
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:18.060]   That that's how we determine see the word Zoe to be alive is closely related to the word
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.720]   Aos and Amy which means to breathe or to or to have the breath of life
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.040]   The words are are intimately related this Zoe and breath
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.460]   So in the scriptures in second Timothy 316, he says that all scripture in NIV
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.560]   It says inspired but the literal word there is God breathed
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.420]   So I think the NASB it says all scripture is God breathed
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.840]   And it is powerful or teaching reproof or correction training and righteousness
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.640]   So what he means by that is that his very life has been invested in his words
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.440]   That Zoe is in the context of his word
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:03.120]   That's why the Bible says in John chapter 1 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and word was
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.960]   God
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   What is the significance of all of this?
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   scripture says in Genesis 2 7
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.320]   After he created all of creation
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.240]   he comes to man and creates man and he says then the Lord God formed a man out of dust from the ground and
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.600]   Breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living creature
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:32.320]   Now he didn't form it and then just let it go. He said that's a distinction between all other creation and mankind
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.040]   He put his very breath his very life into Adam and Eve
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.960]   That was a distinction between at man and all other creation all other animals
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.760]   so our life
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.160]   Was to be a reflection of his life
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:54.360]   But the scripture says that if you disobey if you disconnect yourself from my commandments
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.220]   You shall surely die now. He didn't physically bios die
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.900]   But his Zoe he was separated
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   In Ephesians 418 it says they are darkened in understanding alienated from the life of God from the Zoe of God
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.280]   Because of the ignorance that is in them due to their hardness of heart
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:20.680]   The Bible says that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God see the glory of God
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.120]   Basically is talking about the essence of who he is. It is his life
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:31.560]   and so when the Bible says we've fallen short of that glory, it means that we have fallen short of that Zoe and
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.640]   Ever since the fall we've been trying to replace that with something else to make us feel alive
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.520]   And at the end of the day, all it does is produce vanity
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:49.840]   Madness uselessness and every generation that has passed before us gives us the same testimony
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.920]   Fathers tell this to their children
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.440]   their children will tell them to their children because the people who have gone before us and
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.240]   Experienced it tell us the same thing
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.400]   If you go down this path, there is no life. You don't have to be a Christian
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.560]   You don't have to be a Christian to hear this testimony
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.760]   Non-christians and Christian is alike will tell you the same thing. Why do you think at the end of their life?
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:21.360]   They say you know what? I spent all my time pursuing money. That's not where real life is. I spent all my time traveling
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.960]   I amassed this great fortune. I became rich and famous and they'll tell their children. That's not where life is now
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.480]   They don't know where life is, but they know where it is not
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   It is not there
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.440]   see
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.520]   It says we have become darkened in our understanding and in our pursuit of Zoe
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.080]   We have become corrupt
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.280]   We have denied our Creator
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.680]   It's interesting, you know
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.280]   You can get in a conversation with people about the existence of God and they go back and forth and obviously the common prejudice is
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.740]   How can you believe God this is created by man?
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.960]   And you know, I had a conversation not too long ago about with somebody and they said, you know
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.560]   I don't believe in God, but I believe in aliens, right?
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.440]   You know God was created by man, but aliens, you know, look at the size of this universe
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.200]   Can you possibly think that we're the only being you know looking at the size of this galley?
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.720]   There's got to be something out there, right? You don't believe in God
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.080]   But you believe in aliens, right? Is that that makes sense to you?
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.440]   The fact that you know, we talked about the resurrection
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.320]   That Jews and Gentiles who hated each other for hundreds and hundreds of years
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.580]   Despised each other all of a sudden say they saw the resurrection of Christ. They start calling each other brothers and sisters
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.600]   right
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:49.480]   Instantaneously you had slave owners and slaves all of a sudden in the same church serving one another
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:57.520]   You had tax collectors and then who were teaching and then you had the Pharisees who despised them
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:04.640]   Sitting under their teaching and when did this happen all of a sudden how many people everywhere thousands of them?
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.000]   And you look at that and say that's all man created
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.920]   That's no different than saying, you know
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.200]   All these politicians who are now making all these promises if you vote for me, I'm gonna get rid of Al-Qaeda Isis ISIL
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.460]   You know, whatever financial problems. I'm gonna solve it like how long three days
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.180]   Give me three days. All right, give me three days and then I'm gonna go in office and everything's gonna be fixed, right?
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.500]   Yes, we can
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   No, you cannot we know that for sure. We've seen politicians that have come and gone
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.980]   That's no different to say so. Oh it happened and we believe it
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:45.580]   That is you refuse to accept that but it's not too hard for you to accept
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.380]   aliens
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:54.180]   Years ago I was out in China and I befriended one of the one of the leaders there and I remember him saying, you know
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.420]   Peter I can't believe that you believe this stuff
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.100]   You know
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.100]   And he said because all this prejudice to all the things that he learned when he was a child
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:06.540]   Growing up and he he said to me, you know, you don't seem you seem like an intelligent guy
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:12.860]   You know able to have intelligent conversation and he said I don't understand why you believe this and we became good friends
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.340]   That was in the beginning of our friendship and then after a while we became comfortable enough
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:23.300]   Where he was starting to open up to me and one day he told me that he felt like he was destined for something greater
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.500]   And I thought that okay, that's an opportunity for me to share the gospel with him. So I asked him when you say destiny
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.820]   What do you mean?
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.420]   So he's kind of thought about it. So I mean that
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:39.020]   There's something that's kind of driving my life to something greater. So I said, okay, let me stop right there
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.380]   Let me ask you so you're saying there's something more powerful than you
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.660]   And I'm assuming that power has to be more intelligent than you
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.860]   That's guiding you to something greater than you. Is that what you're saying?
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.380]   and he said
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.060]   Yeah, I guess I guess that's what destiny means
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:02.980]   So I asked him. Okay, so you believe in something more powerful you believe in something more intelligent, right?
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.180]   and and more purposeful than what you can imagine and
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.660]   You refuse to acknowledge that as God
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:19.700]   So the world will see that there's something obviously more powerful driving this universe and what do they call it?
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.300]   mother nature
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.900]   So if they can't explain some powerful force that driving is somewhere
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.340]   They say Oh mother nature did that when they look at the ecology in the universe and all this stuff
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.540]   They just call it mother nature. Well, what do you mean by mother nature something powerful?
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:41.140]   Something intelligent something purposeful. So whether you call it mother nature or
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:46.580]   Evolution, whatever you want to call it. The scripture says that mankind refuses
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.680]   Refuses to acknowledge God as creator and rather to worship the creation
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.380]   Even in the context of them obviously acknowledging there's something there
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.460]   They refuse to acknowledge that as God the scripture says
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.060]   Mankind has become corrupt
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.740]   And in our corruption our understanding has become darkened and this is the state of mankind
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   And we're trying to restore that Zoe outside of God, which is impossible
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.060]   How many of you guys heard of that what happened this week with Microsoft?
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.180]   They created a artificial intelligence and then connected it to the Twitter account. Yeah
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.460]   You guys don't have Facebook. All right
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:34.140]   Some of you guys read it. So Microsoft created this robot an artificial AI and
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.820]   Connected it to Twitter so that it could interact with the Twitter world
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.380]   And the purpose of this was so that they said this artificial intelligence is going to become smarter and smarter the more it interacts with
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:51.020]   The world through Twitter so they opened up an account and they say and they was big news like this artificial intelligence
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.660]   we're going to the next level and they open up the count and
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.420]   one day they had to shut it down and
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.700]   Here's the article that basically will tell you what happened
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:09.620]   My school Microsoft shuts down Twitter AI bot after it became a flaming racist
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.620]   Hitler loving maniac
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.460]   That's the title
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:21.860]   Explaining what happened they have to shut it down because he said it became a flaming racist Hitler loving maniac
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:30.220]   Basically it absorbed what we was cool was coming through Twitter and it became what it became they couldn't accept
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.780]   So they have to shut it down. So they're trying to saying okay next time maybe we can't just give it to the world
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.460]   We have to filter make sure that it's not doing this
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.780]   So basically whether they want to admit or not, this is the world that we live in
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:49.440]   Right. This this was creation of mankind and it reflect man mankind in one day
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.940]   It didn't take years in one day a flaming racist
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.180]   Hitler loving maniac was created in one day
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:07.900]   The scripture says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God the once that Zoe was taken away and
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.780]   was
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.660]   was lost
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.820]   We've been trying so hard to replace that with everything
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:22.180]   And at the end of the day we die every mankind who pursues life in that way
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.540]   Saying the same thing
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.660]   The Solomon said vanity vanity all is vanity
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:35.300]   It's the only one who has this Zoe in and of themselves is God John 5 26
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:42.260]   Jesus says for as the father has life in himself. So he has granted the son also to have life in himself
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.900]   You know what Jesus was saying?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.820]   Only God only God my father has life in himself
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.020]   But he has also granted that to me
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:55.540]   clearly Jesus was saying I am God and
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.980]   That's exactly what the what the Jews heard and because of that
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:06.860]   He said we're trying to stone you not because of your good deeds, but because you mere man claim to be God
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.060]   That's exactly what he was claiming. I have life within myself
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.860]   When Moses I was at the burning bush if they asked me Pharaoh asked me who sent me
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.660]   What should I tell them and he said tell them I am has sent you
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.720]   The only being where life is contained by himself
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.500]   Where Zoe is not a result of hard work
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.620]   Where Zoe was something outside of it
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:38.580]   The only being where Zoe exists by himself is God and that's why he says I am
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:46.420]   And Jesus himself says John 14 6 I am the way I am the truth and I am the Zoe
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:55.420]   See this Jesus who came this Zoe that mankind has been looking for longing for even praying for
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:04.020]   Came in the physical manifestation of Jesus Christ in first John 1 2 says the life the Zoe was made manifest
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:09.140]   And we have seen it and testified to it and proclaimed to you that eternal Zoe
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.860]   Which was with the father and was made manifest to us
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:21.100]   What was lost at the fall was manifested in Christ to bring us back to the author of this Zoe
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.540]   That's what Christianity ultimately is all about
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:32.180]   It's not simply about the suffering. It's not simply that we can go to heaven and exist forever that this life
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.780]   That we can't find in anything else
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.700]   can only be found in Jesus and
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:47.060]   The purpose of the resurrection is that he died in order that we may have this resurrected life life
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.660]   It's about life
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:54.740]   Again in John 5 24 says I tell you the truth whoever hears my word and believes him
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:37:01.340]   Who sent me has eternal Zoe and will not be condemned. He has crossed over from death
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.660]   to life
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.660]   sometimes even as Christians
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.620]   We think you know what? I believe in Jesus. So now I'm gonna go to heaven and
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.260]   Then we spend the rest of our life looking for Zoe somewhere else
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.700]   So you missed the whole point of salvation when you do that
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.660]   You missed the whole point of why Jesus came if you think that somehow
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.100]   Jesus's life and death is simply about being in heaven for eternity
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:33.940]   Jesus says in Mark 10 45 for even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life his
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.260]   Zoe as a ransom for many
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:42.680]   The only person that can give us Zoe is the one who has the Zoe which was Jesus
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:50.820]   He lived a sinless and perfect life became a sacrifice for us who became sin and gave us his life
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.580]   That you and I may also have that life
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:59.740]   In Romans 8 11, it says if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:06.700]   He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through the Spirit who dwells in you
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.860]   You know right before Jesus was resurrected
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.540]   He raised Lazarus from the dead
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.540]   But why do we celebrate Jesus's resurrection and not Lazarus's?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:22.740]   In fact, if you comb through scripture, you will find half a dozen people who died and was brought back to life
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:28.080]   If you read medical history, maybe you know if you comb through history
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.380]   There are several maybe dozens of people who claim that they were
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.020]   Legally declared dead and came back to life even sometimes in the funeral home
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:42.460]   What made Jesus's resurrection so unique and different that a billion people around the world?
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.180]   Are worshipping him
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.020]   To his resurrection wasn't simply about him
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.900]   He his resurrection wasn't simply about a resuscitation of vials
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:57.020]   His resurrection was about restoring Zoe
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:03.820]   Not just to himself but to mankind that's why the Bible says Jesus Christ is the first fruit
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.220]   Among those who are dead to be resurrected
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.060]   Meaning that you and I are next
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:15.380]   That when he comes in his glory, we will also be glorified him with him in life
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   and
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.580]   Maybe some of you guys have come into this room and maybe even some of you Christians
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.620]   Have come into this room asking that question. Is this it?
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.100]   You know in college you have all the hopes of you know
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.940]   Go getting a job getting married having kids and you know
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:38.220]   And you're kind of up there now and and now you're looking at your life thinking. Is this it?
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.980]   Is this it
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   And the answer to that is absolutely no, this is not it
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:55.600]   Not because there's something coming down the road not because there's better future or circumstance or better person somewhere down the road
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:01.500]   But our very hopes of what it has been hinging on was wrong to begin with
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:07.560]   And there's a reason why the scripture says to fix your eyes upon Jesus
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.580]   The author and the perfecter of this Zoe
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   see
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.900]   Jesus and his death and resurrection is not simply about us our justification
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:24.180]   That we've been justified and now we're gonna be in heaven forever. It is also about our sanctification
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.100]   It also about a continual restoration and finding life in Jesus
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.980]   continually
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.900]   If salvation if life that he offers is something that begins when we go to heaven
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:41.580]   you missed the whole point the whole point of salvation is to restore that Zoe today and
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.220]   Eternity is just an on
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.620]   continuation of what God started today
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.860]   You know years ago
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:55.300]   I was a ESL teacher and I was able to teach different levels and then my favorite class was level 5
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:02.340]   And when I was teaching level 5, I would say about 70 80 percent were Mexican Americans and
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.420]   hard-working guys
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:10.500]   You know work physical labor all day and then they would be at the school from 5 30 to 9 o'clock at night
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.660]   every single day Monday through Thursday and
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:18.180]   I really grew fond of them and I taught that cost maybe about a year a year and a half
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:24.760]   But I remember like Christmas season would come around and almost half the class would disappear for a whole month
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:30.420]   You know, so I was really discouraged thinking like, okay, you know, they hate my class and then around January
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   They would come back all of them all at once
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.820]   So in my mind is like are you guys all related?
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.380]   Like how did you all disappear and all show up at the same time?
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.540]   And then I was having a conversation and one of the guys told me he said, you know
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.140]   This is part of our culture in Mexico. We don't celebrate Christmas one day
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.380]   We celebrate it for a whole month
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.780]   So especially in the area that we came from so all of our families who spread out all over
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:59.620]   Mexico and some some are in California and Texas they would all come back and spend a whole month together and he said it's awesome
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.380]   It's really good and he was apologizing that it couldn't come there. But you know, this is this highlight of our year
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.820]   I take all my kids all the grandkids. We all go there spend the whole, you know whole month together
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.260]   I said wow, that's awesome. And he said wow, you must miss that. He said yeah, I really miss it
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.540]   You know because it's hard here because here we're working all the time
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:24.100]   Sometimes working 60 70 hours and then you know, because they don't know the language. They're trying to learn the language. It's much harder, right?
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.860]   Just like any immigrant would be
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:31.820]   So I asked him, you know, do you ever think about going back and he said yeah all the time
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.660]   I
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.420]   Mean so easy for you. I mean you can just go you you have a legal status here
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.940]   I mean, how come you don't go back if you're so much more happier there than here. Why don't you go back?
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.900]   And he says because if I go back I won't have this
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.640]   So what is it this? Well, I make a lot more money here than over there. There's no job opportunity
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.820]   So even though I'm happier there, I won't have the apartment
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.700]   I won't have the car, you know the luxuries and the clothes and the things that they have
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.760]   So in my mind is like well you you told me you're happier over there with lesser stuff
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.740]   But you said you can't go back. Yeah, I know I know you know
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.500]   I know what that sounds like to you and I think about that all the time, but he said I can't go back
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.460]   Hey, and I remember thinking
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.260]   And what a trap
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.660]   What a trap
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:23.580]   It's kind of like a carrot dangling in front of people's eyes thinking like only if I had that only half I had that and
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.460]   That's a lie of the devil
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.500]   That the Zoe does not exist here
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.580]   That the whole point of Christian life is to restore that Zoe
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.940]   Maybe again some of you guys are sitting here again even as Christians
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:44.900]   But what you are dissatisfied by the hole in your life or your heart that you're trying to fill with something someplace someone
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:51.340]   Then no matter how hard you run no matter how far you look at it's not there
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:56.780]   He said he had come to give Zoe and give this life abundantly
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.620]   God doesn't want you to be unhappy
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:06.500]   But what we are pursuing ultimately that we think is gonna bring happiness is only going to bring judgment and destruction
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:13.060]   and that's why he says come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.740]   I will give you that rest
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:20.740]   That's Sabbath that peace that you are looking for is not found in a person
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:25.300]   It's not found in your husband. It's not found in your wife. It's not found in your kids
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:30.780]   It's not found in a community. It's not found in money or vacation or things
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.020]   It's in Christ and Christ alone
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:40.700]   And that's why when we when God opens our eyes to see this life in Christ
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:48.840]   That we come to him not simply because we don't want to go to hell because that's where I find life
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:55.740]   Let me conclude with a song that popped into my head when I was finishing, you know wrapping up the sermon
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.780]   Let me know if you know this song I was looking for love in all the wrong places
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.140]   Okay
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.040]   Everybody a little bit older, you know only in some of you
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:12.100]   Looking like me like what is that? I will let me I'm not gonna sing it for you. Okay, it's not a Christian song
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.100]   It's not about God
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:20.620]   But I think the heart of what what the song says kind of captures the heart of the world in some sense
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.180]   Well, I spent a lifetime looking for you
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.020]   Single bars and good time lovers were never true
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.500]   playing a fool's game hoping to win and
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.740]   Telling those sweet lies and losing again. I
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:42.660]   Was looking for love in all the wrong places looking for love in too many faces searching their eyes looking for traces of
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.180]   What I'm dreaming of hoping to find a friend and a lover
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.900]   I'll bless a day that I discover another heart looking for love and
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:56.060]   I was alone then no loved in sight and I did everything I could to get me through the night
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.780]   Don't know where it started or where it might end. I turned to a stranger just like a friend. I
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:09.700]   Was looking for love in all the wrong places looking for love in too many faces searching their eyes looking for traces of what I'm dreaming
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:16.400]   Of hoping to find a friend and a lover. I'll bless a day that I discover another heart looking for love
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.220]   Now what he says in love
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.060]   Whether you want to use the word love or peace or happiness
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.860]   The heart of the message is the same
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:32.780]   Looking for life in all the wrong places in all the wrong faces
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:39.140]   Changing minds changing circumstance changing decisions thinking somehow it's down the street
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.620]   when all along
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:45.780]   It's in Christ and Christ alone. See that's what Christianity is about
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.980]   Christianity isn't simply about death and suffering
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   It's that through his death and through his suffering that you and I may have life and have this life abundantly. I
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:05.620]   Pray that you and I would recognize this that he would be the one we run to when we are lonely
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.820]   That he's the one that we run to when we're anxious
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   That he's the one that we go to when we feel empty
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.940]   That he's the one that we go to
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.260]   When we need life
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.260]   Would you close your eyes with me?
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:25.180]   As we can ask the praise team to come up
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:31.780]   Let's thank Jesus collectively for what this day represents
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.580]   That because he died
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:40.180]   You and I may have life if you are here this morning because a friend invited you here
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:47.900]   And maybe the message that you heard this morning that you can relate to maybe you've been searching you've been looking and there's an emptiness in
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.300]   Your heart and not realizing that it may be because you've been separated from the author of life
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:59.940]   And the Bible says that the only way that that can be restored is if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.420]   Believe in your heart that he was raised from the dead
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   And he says you can't will be saved
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:11.060]   If he asked for forgiveness he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.820]   He's eager to forgive us and to restore that
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.220]   He gave his life that we may have his life
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:23.020]   So I want to encourage you this morning as you're sitting there to ask yourself
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.900]   Can this be true? And if it is
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.460]   Will God accept me
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.820]   He will accept you he's eagerly waiting
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:38.020]   So I ask you to take time to come before the Lord and pray just an honest prayer
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.500]   You don't have to have a religious prayer. Just honestly God. I
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.940]   Want your salvation forgive me of my sins
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:52.620]   I've been searching and running and going and I all I find is emptiness. I
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.100]   Want to have this life that you sacrifice for me
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:01.340]   Would you take some time to pray and again? We encourage you to come look for us
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:07.160]   Whether it's today or any any other day if our email is on the program
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.900]   You can just email us and we'll be more than willing to sit down and answer any kind of questions that you have
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.700]   And again for the rest of us, let's take some time to pray
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:20.340]   And to really seek the Lord and to thank him with all our heart for what he has done. Let's pray
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.760]   (soft music)
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Thank you for watching!
