[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Good morning, church family.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.760]   My name is Matthew, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.920]   So growing up, I was very shy and didn't have many friends.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.360]   Like many other people, I also grew up going to church.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.860]   However, in second grade, a classmate's parents introduced me to, or introduced my family
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.560]   to a basketball league that their son played in.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.520]   I was forced into playing basketball, and although I eventually enjoyed it and made
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.400]   many friends through it, our games were on Sundays.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.520]   As my younger brothers got involved too, we got even busier on weekends, and that meant
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000]   no more going to church.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.960]   Towards the end of middle school, my family started church hopping.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520]   By the beginning of high school, we began to settle down at a church.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.560]   We went with a friend's family, but never really got plugged in or involved in the church
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.560]   community.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.960]   At this point in my life, I would say that I believed that there was a God.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.880]   However, I definitely didn't have a personal relationship with him.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.080]   I knew that I was a sinner, but I didn't truly understand the magnitude of my sin or how
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   my sin separated me from a holy God.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.240]   I believed in a watered-down version of the gospel, not one that pierced like a sword.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.040]   As the oldest sibling in my family and as the oldest of my cousins, I never had someone
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.600]   older around me to help prepare me for later stages in life.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.760]   Therefore, going to college, I didn't know where my Christian life would go or how it
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   would continue.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.840]   I didn't know that fellowships existed at all.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.320]   I didn't have a car with me or know of any good churches to attend, and so I didn't have
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.720]   any real expectations to pursue Christianity more while I was away from home.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.600]   My first quarter of college was very lonely.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.680]   I didn't have any close friends there and would only occasionally hang out with my roommates.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.260]   I would sometimes listen to sermons online, but never regularly, and honestly, sometimes
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.040]   just to help fall asleep at night.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.960]   But by God's grace, during my winter quarter, I met someone while playing basketball.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.480]   We started to hang out, and he eventually introduced me to a fellowship.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   I started getting more involved in the fellowship, started attending a local church, and eventually
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.760]   moved into a department with several other guys.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.920]   I was able to get a strong sense of Christian community and learn how other Christians behaved
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080]   outside of church.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.320]   For the first time in my life, I had people my age or older to look towards for advice
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.760]   and guidance.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   I was able to see different qualities in others that I was able to learn so much from.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.640]   Through this time and a few other college experiences, I realized that I needed to have
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.840]   a relationship with Jesus and that I was not going to be able to find satisfaction or worth
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.360]   on my own through grades, friendships, or sports.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.200]   I began to read my Bible, go to church regularly, and grow in my faith.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.440]   I remember one particular retreat down in San Diego where the gospel struck me harder
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360]   than any other time before.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.760]   I finally understood how great and significant my sin was because it separated me from God.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.960]   But in God's love and mercy, while I was still a sinner, Christ came to die for me.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.120]   I think it's then that I truly repented and put my trust in Christ and received forgiveness.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.920]   Because of my newfound understanding of the gospel and God's unconditional love for me,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   I've come to treasure Christ above anything else in this world.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.460]   And I have a desire to glorify God in all aspects of my life, whether that's seeking
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.000]   opportunities to share the gospel or serving others through my career.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.400]   There's still so much room to grow, but I've definitely grown spiritually and I'm able
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.000]   to take various life events more in stride now than before.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.960]   Jumping into full-time work with enough hours for two jobs presents its own challenges,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.600]   but I'm grateful that I found this church where I'm able to continue to grow along other
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   brothers and sisters.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.460]   While I struggle with sin, I'm being sanctified day by day, and especially during these chaotic
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.480]   and scary times, I have a hope that surpasses other hopes because it's in the promises of
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   Jesus Christ.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Thank you.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   [applause]
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:04:12.700]   >> Matthew, do you understand when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.900]   in his death, and when you come out, you're uniting with his resurrected life?
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   >> Yes.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   >> And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   [applause]
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   >> Thank you.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   [applause]
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   [applause]
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   [applause]
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.260]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.100]   [APPLAUSE]
