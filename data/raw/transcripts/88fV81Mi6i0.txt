[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   As many of you guys know, our BAM,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   Singles Ministry, is up at the retreat,
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.900]   and so that's why, you know,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   things are kind of out of whack a little bit, okay?
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.900]   So you don't realize how much of our singles
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.900]   are serving the church until they're gone.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   So if things aren't running smoothly,
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.900]   it's because they're not here, okay?
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.900]   We're waiting, waiting 'til next week.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.900]   All right, so this week,
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.900]   the hermeneutics Bible study is starting
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.900]   this coming Wednesday at 7 p.m.,
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900]   and the home groups are also starting.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   So for whatever reason, if you haven't signed up,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.900]   please sign up for that.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.900]   And if you are new to the church
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900]   and you wanted to participate,
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   we ask you to come to Wednesday Bible study,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   and Pastor Mark will be able to help you
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   when you come in, and Justin will
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.900]   kind of get you situated in the right place, okay?
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   So that's starting this week.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900]   Family ministry prayer meeting.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   If you're part of the family ministry,
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   there is a prayer meeting going on
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.900]   on February 8th, this coming Saturday.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   Is it this Saturday?
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   Yeah, this Saturday at 9.15 a.m.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.900]   at the Youth Chapel across the courtyard.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.900]   So please come to that,
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   and let them know that you're coming.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.900]   And then next Sunday,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.900]   we have a communion Sunday taking place,
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.900]   so please prepare your hearts for that.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.900]   If you are a parent of our Sprouts department
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.900]   from kindergarten to sixth grade,
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.900]   next Sunday there is a PTA meeting
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.900]   that's taking place to kick off
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   the beginning of the year.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.900]   The sign-ups are on the QR code.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.900]   I guess that's up there.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.900]   And child care will be provided,
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.900]   so they'll need to know if you're coming
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.900]   and how many children you have,
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.900]   and so they can find the right number
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.900]   of babysitters for that,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.900]   so please sign up for that.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.900]   Men's ministry fellowship.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.900]   This is our quarterly men's ministry fellowship
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.900]   that's kicking off on Saturday on February 15th
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.900]   at 9.00 a.m. at the fellowship hall.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.900]   And the purpose of this
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.900]   is to live living life purposefully,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.900]   and it is kind of goal-setting
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.900]   for the men's ministry,
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.900]   and there will be a talk on that
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   and an opportunity to sit down
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   and to goal-set for not only this year,
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   but kind of projecting in life,
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.900]   and so it will help to do that.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   That's happening on February 15th,
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   not this Saturday, but the coming Saturday.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.900]   The lunch -- the cost for the lunch is $10,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   and the final sign-up is next Sunday,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.900]   and after that, the fee will go up to $15, okay?
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   So if you are planning to come,

[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.900]   we will talk about navigating the different life stages,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.900]   and we will have some service professionals

[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.900]   from the OC Regional Center
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.900]   and the Department of Rehab
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.900]   available to answer questions.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.900]   So if you have a loved one or a student
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.900]   or even are just curious
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.900]   on how you can support a church family with an ASD,
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   you're welcome to join.

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.900]   and we hope it will be a helpful session
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.900]   and an opportunity to gain knowledge,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.900]   support, and resources that are available.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:41.900]   Thank you.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.900]   All right, thank you.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.900]   You can sign up for that,
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   and that's happening on February 22nd.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.900]   Let me pray for us, and again, to give online,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.900]   and if you have a physical offering,
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.900]   there's a box in the back on the way out.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   All right, let's pray.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.900]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes toward Christ,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   to know, Father, that ultimately our help
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   and our refuge is in him.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.900]   Help us, Lord God, to untangle whatever it is
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   that we have been tangled in this world.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.900]   Help us to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   knowing that he is the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   I pray that everything that we do, Father God,
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   will be an overflow of the tremendous grace that you've given us,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.900]   that our worship may be in spirit and in truth.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.900]   I pray that this giving would reflect your love toward us
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
