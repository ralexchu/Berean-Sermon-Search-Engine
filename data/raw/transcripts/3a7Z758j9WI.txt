[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:32.540]   - All right, good morning, Breen Community Church.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.900]   The weather has cooled down significantly.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.100]   This morning it was like a 84,
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.540]   actually 82 and the humidity was 80
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.420]   and now it's 80, 65.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.740]   So it's gonna get cold.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.940]   All right, I gotta, let me start.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.620]   Oh, here it is.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.980]   Okay, so I'm gonna start with the happy birthday.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.420]   So Maddie Lowe, okay, online,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.220]   she's turning eight this week, so happy birthday.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.580]   And then Gracie Kwok, she's only one,
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.380]   I can't believe one year has gone by already.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.100]   So happy birthday to you, even if you don't understand.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.140]   All right, happy birthday to you.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.500]   We have just a few announcements before we get started.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.580]   First of all, our weekday Bible study,
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.980]   a home group weekday Bible study is gonna start
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.540]   not this week, but next week.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.780]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.540]   please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.180]   We've already made small groups,
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.700]   but if you would need to be added to the groups,
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   please do so.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.100]   Even if you are part of the home group
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.940]   and it's kind of assumed that you're gonna be participating
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.500]   in that, please sign up for that
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   because we wanna make sure that there's plenty of room
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.260]   to be able to direct you towards certain places.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.260]   The other thing is we have the outreach event
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.500]   that's gospel night that's happening
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.100]   this coming Saturday at 4 p.m.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.660]   We actually have quite a few people who have signed up.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.620]   And so I think one of the benefits of doing it online,
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.380]   there's more people who are able to come
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.580]   as a result of that.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.940]   So even if you're not coming,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.300]   please continue to keep them in your prayer.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.700]   As the Bible says, it's the Holy Spirit that convicts
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.660]   and opens the eyes of sinners
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.980]   to be able to see the truth of the gospel.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.260]   And so we really need the whole church
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.500]   to be praying for this Saturday,
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.260]   the event's at 4 p.m.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.940]   And so if you're bringing friends again to keep praying,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.260]   but even if you're not coming, please keep that in mind.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.620]   And every day as you guys are taking time to pray,
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.740]   to remember that, that again,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.180]   that everyone who's participating,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.540]   that the gospel message will be clear.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.300]   Those who are presenting, the pastors and the elders
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.740]   who are presenting that and leading that,
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.500]   that God will give them wisdom and grace.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.780]   And again, that it would be a very fruitful time
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.820]   this coming Saturday.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.060]   All right, look at that.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.460]   You feel the wind?
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.860]   I feel it.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.260]   Thank you.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.900]   All right, so we're gonna pray.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.780]   And then again, get an opportunity to give
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.340]   and then our physical offering is in the back corner.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.860]   So please, if you're gonna do that, do that afterwards.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.980]   All right, let's pray.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.860]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.740]   We thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.220]   to be able to come and worship you.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.660]   Help us, Lord God, to have a thankful heart
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.620]   that even in this hot sun,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.500]   the privilege that we have to be able to gather.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.580]   And we know that there are many brothers and sisters
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580]   around the world, Lord God, who risk health
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.340]   and sometimes even their lives to fellowship together,
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.820]   to worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.260]   So we pray, Father God, that you would give us focus,
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.820]   that you give us courage to live the conviction
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.380]   that you've given us.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.780]   And even in our giving, help us to do it in a manner
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.820]   that honors you as an act of worship.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.860]   May it be multiplied for your use.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.220]   (gentle piano music)

[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews 10:19,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   and we're gonna be reading to verse 25,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   but we're gonna be getting up to verse 23 today.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   Okay, Hebrews 10:19-25.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:46.780]   All right, reading out of the NSV,
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.780]   "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.200]   "to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   "by a new and living way,
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.900]   "which He inaugurated for us through the veil,
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.200]   "that is His flesh,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   "and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   "let us draw near with a sincere heart
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.700]   "in full assurance of faith,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.200]   "having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.900]   "and our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.280]   "Let us hold fast a confession of our hope without wavering,
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.400]   "for He who promised is faithful.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   "And let us consider how to stimulate one another
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.700]   "to love and good deeds,
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.900]   "not forsaking our own assembling together,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.500]   "as is the habit of some,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.700]   "but encouraging one another,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.200]   "and all the more, as you see the day drawing near."
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.400]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.900]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your goodness.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.400]   We thank You for the privilege that we have to come
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.900]   and draw near to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.400]   I pray that Your word would have its effect on us.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   May it not return until it has accomplished
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.900]   the purpose that You have ordained.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.900]   - Amen.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.900]   - You know, today,
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.700]   if somebody says that they're Christian,
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.900]   the word Christian has been diluted to the point
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   where you have to ask further questions.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.900]   What kind of Christian?
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.900]   Do you believe the Bible?
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.400]   Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.700]   Do you believe that Christ is the only way?
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.400]   And you have to clarify that
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   because more than 70% of the United States
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.700]   identify with Christianity.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.900]   People say that they're Christian
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.400]   because they were born into a Christian home.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.700]   People say that they're Christian
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.900]   because they admire Jesus as a great man.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.200]   People will say that they're Christians
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.900]   simply because they're surrounded by other Christians.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.700]   And so for whatever the reason,
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.900]   the term Christian itself isn't what it used to be.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.200]   So you have to figure out
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.900]   like what specifically do they believe?
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.600]   And we find out that, you know,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.200]   majority of people who claim to be Christians
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.900]   are not biblical Christians,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   because the Bible describes what a Christian is.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   Well, years ago, that was not the case.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.400]   When the term Christian was first given to Christians,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.900]   it was to identify clearly those who belong to Christ.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.900]   And the word Christian literally just meant
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   the little Christ.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.400]   And so it was identifying people who are followers of Jesus.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.900]   Now, prior to that,
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.400]   obviously you had people who said that they were Jews
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   and they were, you know, were they part of the Essenes?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   Were they Sadducees?
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.900]   Were they Pharisees?
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.900]   Who are they?
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   And so they had all these different distinctions
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   of people who are theists, right?
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.900]   Now, well, you believe in many gods
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.400]   and I worship this God or that God.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.900]   And so when they started calling Christians Christian,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.400]   that term Christian identified everybody,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.900]   no matter what background you came from,
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.900]   whether you were formerly an idol worshiper,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.400]   whether you are a Jew
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   and you worship the God of the Old Testament,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.900]   but you had different views, different theology.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.400]   So when they say he's a Christian,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.900]   it was clear identity
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.400]   with the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   and that they were actually following him,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.900]   that they were new creation.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   The old is gone, behold, the new has come.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.400]   So the biblical understanding of a Christian
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.900]   is a Christian who's made a decision
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   to be a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   not simply an admirer,
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.900]   not simply somebody who says, you know what?
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.900]   I agree with these set of doctrines.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   The Bible makes that very clear.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.900]   Even the demons believe who Jesus is.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.900]   And because they know who Jesus is,
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.900]   they shudder, they fear.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   They fear God more than average theist in our generation
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.400]   because they know who he is.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.900]   They know that judgment is coming.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.900]   But in the book of James, it says that just identifying
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.400]   and say, well, we believe, we believe that there's one God.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Good, even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.900]   So the biblical understanding of a Christian
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.400]   is someone who not only embraces the doctrine,
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   but has identified as a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.900]   Follower meaning that you have to go where he goes,
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.400]   you have to do what he does,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   and you actually follow his steps.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.900]   All that the author of Hebrews has been teaching
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.400]   about Christology,
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   all of it is really to bring us to this point
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   so that the readers of Hebrews would change their behavior.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.900]   Whatever that they were doing to cause him to drift,
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   it wasn't simply because the author of Hebrews
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.400]   was concerned, he said, you know what, they took a test
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.900]   and they just didn't know how to answer these questions.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.400]   You know, they didn't know how to answer Christology
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   and about the identity of Jesus
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   and how he fulfilled the tabernacle.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.900]   And so the point of the letter to Hebrews
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.400]   wasn't simply to get the doctrine right.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   They needed to get the doctrine right
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.900]   so that they can change their behavior.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.400]   And if you read the New Testament,
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   all of the letters are written in that format.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.900]   They would give us the correct doctrine
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.900]   and then it always leads to therefore.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.900]   Therefore, this is how you ought to apply this.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.400]   So you guys, you know, we just finished the study
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.900]   of the book of Ephesians chapter 1, 2, 3,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.400]   basically is Christology about salvation.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   Chapter 4, 5, 6 was the application of that, right?
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   Book of Romans, we finished a while back,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   chapter 1 through 11 is about soteriology,
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.900]   about, you know, study of the doctrine.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   And then chapter 12 and on is the application of that, right?
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:09.900]   And so book of Hebrews has heavily emphasized
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.400]   and in between it would give us these imperatives,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   but we're at a point where he's beginning to move away
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.900]   and maybe at the end part of Christology
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   and then we're going to get into chapter 11
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.400]   as examples of people who are living by faith
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.900]   and then chapter 12 and on,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.400]   he's going to just heavily emphasize what we ought to do.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.900]   So we can say that this section,
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.400]   the text that we're looking at now,
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   is the beginning of that, right?
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   Is the beginning part of introduction to the imperative.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.400]   Now that you have all the doctrines of Jesus,
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.900]   superiority of Christ,
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.900]   what does that mean outside of, you know, right?
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.900]   What is the proper response to that?
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.400]   So there are three things that he,
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   three imperatives that you'll see.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   So in verse 22, the first imperative is,
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.900]   "Let us draw near with sincere hearts."
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.400]   Let us draw near.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   And so I titled that "Reaching Up," right?
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.900]   Our response, first and foremost, is to reach up.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.900]   23, "Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope,"
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   to reach in, right?
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.400]   So first, to draw near to God.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.900]   Second, to hold fast to what we have.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.400]   And then verse 24,
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   "And let us consider how to stimulate one another,"
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.900]   is to reach out, right?
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.900]   So this, these three imperatives
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.400]   really is the outline of every imperative
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.900]   in the New Testament.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.400]   It falls into these three categories.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.900]   So every preaching of the gospel
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.900]   leads to a challenge to reach up,
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.400]   reach in, and to reach out, right?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.900]   So every imperative you see in the New Testament
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.400]   will fall into one of these three categories.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.900]   Draw near to God,
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.400]   persevere in your faith, right,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.900]   and be sanctified,
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   and then to reach out to other believers
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.900]   and to the world.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.400]   Reach up, reach in, reach out.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.900]   So that's the outline of the sermon for today.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.900]   I'm going to just get into the first two imperatives,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.400]   and then the third one, the verse 24 and 25,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.900]   we'll get to next week, okay?
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.400]   Just so that, give you a heads up.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.900]   We're going to spend most of our time
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.400]   with the first imperative,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   and then we're going to spend some time in the second one,
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.900]   and then again, third one, we'll get into next week, okay?
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.900]   So the first imperative, right?
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.400]   "Therefore," he says, "since we have confidence,"
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.900]   and again, he's reminding us,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.400]   this is something that he's been saying all along.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.900]   "Since we have confidence to enter the holy place
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.400]   by the blood of Jesus,"
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   in other words, since now the door
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.900]   has been opened where it wasn't opened before,
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   "by the new and living way,
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.900]   which he inaugurated for us through the veil,"
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.400]   that is his flesh,
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   "and again, since we have a great high priest
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   over the house of God,"
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   since all of these things that I've been saying is true,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   then our proper response,
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.900]   first and most important response is,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   "Let us draw near."
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.400]   Draw near.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   Now, like I said,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.900]   the first and most important response
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.400]   of every person who hears the gospel
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   is to draw near to God.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.900]   That's his whole point.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.900]   Now, how many of you have ever heard the term "inclusio"?
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.400]   It's not Italian. It's Greek.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   Okay?
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   Well, it's basically a literary form of the New Testament
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   where it begins a thought at one part of the letter,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400]   and then that thought kind of is concluded
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   at another part of the letter,
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   and usually the inclusio could be a very short text,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   but sometimes it could be a long text,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.900]   and usually the reason,
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.400]   how you know that that's the case
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.900]   is that you'll see almost verbatim
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.400]   the same words, the same phrase, same idea
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.900]   that started in one text,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.900]   and then almost exact repeating of that
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.900]   happens at another text,
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   which means the main point was introduced,
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   and then they gave the argument,
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   and then they're giving the conclusion.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.400]   So this text is the end part of that inclusio.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.900]   The first beginning part of that happened
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.900]   in Hebrews 4, 14-16,
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.400]   and let me read it for you,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   and it's going to sound exactly like this text
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   because this is the beginning of this inclusio.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.900]   It says, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.900]   who has passed through the heavens,
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.900]   Jesus the Son of God,
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   let us hold fast our confession.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.400]   For we do not have the high priest
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.900]   but one who has been tempted in all things as we are,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.900]   yet without sin.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.400]   Therefore, let us draw near with confidence
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   to the throne of grace
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   so that we may receive mercy and find grace
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.900]   to help in time of need."
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.900]   So it almost is verbatim
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   of what he is saying in this text,
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.900]   and so this idea is introduced to us in chapter 4,
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   and so in other words,
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.900]   this is kind of like a conclusion
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.900]   of the point that he was trying to make,
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.900]   and then he's going to go into the imperatives
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.900]   and saying that this is how we ought to live.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.400]   So just so that you know the structure
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.900]   of what's going on,
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.400]   and it helps us to understand
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.900]   the importance of what he is saying in this text
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.400]   because it is the conclusion
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.900]   of everything that he's been saying.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.400]   And the most important part of this conclusion
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   of all his argument was to draw near.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.900]   That's his main point, to draw near.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.900]   Not to simply admire from a distance,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.400]   not to just give information.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.900]   In fact, that imperative to draw near
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   is not unique to this text.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.400]   He repeats it over and over again in chapter 4, 16,
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   chapter 7, 19, chapter 7, 25,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.900]   chapter 10, verse 1, chapter 10, 22,
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.900]   chapter 11, verse 6, chapter 12, verse 23.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.400]   Over and over again,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.900]   as he is teaching Christology,
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.900]   he will conclude or he will begin by saying,
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.400]   "Let us draw near."
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   We need to draw near, draw near.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   He's saying this in particular in this context
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   because the people were drifting.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   They were moving away from Christ.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.900]   So every little thing that he says,
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.900]   every imperative, every Christology he gives,
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.400]   he says, "We need to draw near."
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   Remember, the very first things
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   that he said to his disciples,
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   he said to come, right?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.900]   "Come to me and I will make you fishers of men."
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.900]   When he invited the sinners,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.400]   first and foremost, before he sent them out,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.900]   he said to come.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.900]   You know, typically when we think of Jesus' ministry,
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.900]   we think of at the end part of it,
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   he has a great commission.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   He says to go, right?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.900]   Go make disciples.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.400]   And so the mission of the church is to go.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.900]   And so we have a lot of people who are like geared up to go.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.900]   We got to be a missionary.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.400]   We got to share the gospel, which is true, right?
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   God called all of us to go.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.900]   But remember, the very last thing
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   that Jesus says to his disciples
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.400]   before he leaves in John, chapter 15,
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   is to stay.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   The last of the seven "I am" statements,
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.900]   he says, "I am the true vine,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.400]   and you cannot bear fruit unless you remain with me."
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.900]   And that word "remain" basically means to stay.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   That as I called you to myself,
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   you cannot bear fruit unless you remain with me.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.900]   So his last imperative that he gave his disciples
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.900]   before he gave the commandment to go
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   is to remain, to continue to draw near to him,
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.400]   to be connected to him.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.900]   Even the great commission,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.400]   if you remember, he says,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   "Go, therefore, make disciples of all the nations,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.900]   baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.400]   and the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.900]   And then how does it end?
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   "And lo, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   Right?
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   So his commandment is to go,
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.900]   but in order to go, he says,
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.400]   "You must stay. You must remain."
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   So the most important imperative
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   for any sinner or any believer of Christ
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.900]   is to continue to draw near to God.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.900]   We cannot bear fruit.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.400]   We can act, we can perform,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   we can work hard,
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   but unless we are near Christ,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.900]   we cannot bear fruit.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   He says to draw near, right?
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.400]   But he doesn't just say to draw near.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.900]   He says to draw near with confidence.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   I mean, it's one thing to just draw near
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.400]   to the throne of God,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   it's just to come with confidence, with boldness.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   And he mentions that same term all over Hebrews,
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.900]   but again, in the beginning of Inclusio,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   he said, "Hold fast our confession," right?
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.400]   "That we may draw near with," what?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.900]   "Confidence."
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.900]   And then chapter 10, he begins,
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.900]   "Therefore, since we have confidence to draw near."
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   So in both Inclusios,
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   it says not only to draw near,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.400]   but to draw near with confidence.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.900]   Beginning, draw near with confidence.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.400]   Now, since we have this confidence
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   that this is what we ought to do.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   Now, why do you think he emphasizes
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   to be able to come with confidence?
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   Imagine as a Jew,
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   every part of the tabernacle in the Old Testament law,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.900]   the old covenant, did not tell them to come.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.400]   In fact, remember when God was given the covenant
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   at Mount Sinai, remember what he told Moses?
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   Tell these people not to come to the mountain.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   If they come and touch even the outskirts
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   of the mountain, they or even an animal
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   touches this mountain, what did he say?
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.900]   "You shall surely die."
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.400]   Every part of the tabernacle was to teach them
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   to not to casually come in.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   They couldn't come in.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.900]   In fact, remember after he sets up the tabernacle,
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.400]   the very first offering wasn't given correctly
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   and they were consumed with God's fire, with judgment.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   So a Jew would have naturally thought,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   "How can I possibly just enter in?"
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   That's what a Jew would have asked,
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.400]   first question would have been asked,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   "How can I possibly just enter in?"
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   And that's why he's telling them, "No, you're able
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   to come in with confidence. You're able to be bold."
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   Consider that to today.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Even non-Christians have this confidence
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   based upon whatever it is that they heard about God,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   whatever it is that they heard about the gospel,
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   for whatever the reason, confidence in the presence
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   of God is just assumed.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400]   They say, "Yeah, me and God's like this."
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   You see rappers and movie stars and living in
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   licentious sins and they have no fear of God
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   in their life and they say, "You know what?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   Thank my Lord. God did this and God did that."
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   Their relationship with God is just so casual.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   It was just assumed.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   And they have no idea what the scripture says,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   that in their natural state, inasmuch it is appointed
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   for all men to die once, after this comes judgment.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   But they have no idea of this judgment.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   So entering into the presence of God is just assumed
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.400]   in this generation and I think that's the fault
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   of the gospel preachers.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   There's no fear of God and the gospel was preached
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   without any kind of warning and so we have
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   a generation of people who don't understand
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   the holiness of God and so there's this casual
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   understanding, of course, we enter into the presence
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   of God. I entered this morning. I entered at night.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   When I die, I'm going to enter.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   So when I see Jesus and I'm going to have dinner
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   with Him and I'm going to just have a conversation
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   and I'm going to do this with Him.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   It's just so casual because our understanding
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   of who God is isn't coming from scripture.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   It's coming from our culture.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   There's a reason why their author is telling them
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   and reminding them and encouraging these Jews
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   that you're able to come with confidence.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   But this confidence wasn't coming from just,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   again, their experience or their background.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   It was from their knowledge.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   In Romans chapter 10, one through two,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   Paul describes a nation of Israel this way.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   for them is for their salvation.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   Paul's talking about the Jews.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.400]   For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   They're passionate about God.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.400]   And I'm pretty sure that Paul's describing himself here.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   Because Paul was a zealous man.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   He was a passionate man, even to the point
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   where he was willing to kill people and be killed,
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   thinking that he was doing what was righteous
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   in God's eyes. He said, "They have zeal like I did,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   but not in accordance with knowledge."
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   They had this confidence, but it wasn't correct
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.400]   because they had the wrong knowledge.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   See, this confidence isn't just boldness,
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   or it's not just our personality,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   or it's just courage that we're able to muster up.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   He says this confidence comes from correct knowledge
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   of who God is. And that's why he starts by saying,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   "He opened the door. He's our high priest.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   He shed his blood. The veil was torn."
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   And so because of all of this that he has done,
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   this knowledge gives us confidence to enter.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   It is lack of knowledge, or lack of conviction
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   over this knowledge that causes us to be timid.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   Years ago, when I was 19, when I first went to school,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   college, I thought I was going into business.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   So I wanted to learn about real estate.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   I wanted to learn about sales.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   And so I had a friend who was a peer,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   but he was into business.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   His parents were already pretty wealthy.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   They had several factories.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   And his dad actually owned a plastic bag printing company.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   So he would supply those plastic bags with the Ralph logo
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   and, you know, Lucky's.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   I don't know if they still exist today.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   But he would have these contracts,
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   and they would print on the plastic bags.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   So every once in a while, the dad would print something,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   and it would be off.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   So it's not centered or something was off.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.400]   And so basically it was trash.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   So him and I would take these plastic bags that he couldn't give to them,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.400]   and we would load it up in our vans, or his van,
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   and we would drive around, you know, L.A.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   And we spent a lot of time in South Central
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   because that's where all the mom-and-pop shops were
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   because big chain stores didn't want this.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   So these personally owned stores would buy it.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   So every time we sell, we would make about $5, $6.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   But this is, you know, the product was free.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   So we would walk around from store to store,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   and then we would try to sell some.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   And he was a good salesman, and I thought, you know, I was decent at sales.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400]   So we were making some money.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   But I remember walking into this one particular Mexican market,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   and it was not a small one.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   It was privately owned, but the size of it was probably like the size of our sanctuary.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   We went in there, and my friend started talking.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   He was using his broken Spanish, and he was trying to sell these plastic bags.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.400]   And we could tell immediately they were hostile.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.400]   And my friend, we just wouldn't let it go.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   You know, and he said, "No, you've got to buy this.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   It's for free, and he's using his broken Spanish."
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   And you could tell they're getting irritated.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.400]   We were probably there about 15, 20 minutes,
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   and I kept on telling my friend, "Hey, let's get out of here.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   They're not interested."
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   Well, the manager got so ticked off, he literally picked up a broom,
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   and he chased us out of that store.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   You know, and we were walking out, and I said, "Dude, what are you doing, man?
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   Clearly they don't want it."
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   And he said, "Okay."
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   So we walk out.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   We spend the next few hours walking around different stores,
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   and then we're going back, and to get back to our car, we had to pass by this store.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   So my friend has this great idea.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   He's like, "Let's go back in."
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   I said, "What?"
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   You know, we barely made it out alive.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   How are we going to go back in?
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   He said, "No, trust me."
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   So we walked back in, and obviously, you know, I kept my distance,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   just in case he gets stoned, you know what I mean?
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   I don't want to be stoned with him.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   So I'm in the back.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   I'm watching him do his work, and he's going at it with them.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   They're yelling at him, "I told you to get out.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   We're not interested."
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   And he was using his broken Spanish, and they were going back and forth.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   And interesting enough, five minutes into it, the owner--I guess the owner opens up
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   the window from the top, and he's looking down, trying to chase us down,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   and you could tell his demeanor changes all of a sudden.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   And then he says, "How much?"
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   So I was shocked.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.400]   He went from, "Get out of here," you know, "We're going to throw you out,"
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   to, "How much?"
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   As soon as he said that, I was like, "Whoa, this guy's good," right?
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   I'm going to make sure I'm friends with him for a long time.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   This guy--I mean, he became a very successful businessman,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   but he ended up unloading everything that we didn't sell that day.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   And so because it was a big market, he bought everything that we had,
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   and we made more money on that one sale than we did all day walking up and down.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   So I was, like, thoroughly impressed with this guy, and we're walking out,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.400]   and I asked him, I said, "How did you know?"
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   Right?
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   "How did you know that this guy was going to buy?"
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   He said, "Well, I didn't know, but I've been in this store before,
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   and they chased me out before."
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   "And I've sold to them before."
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   So he said, "This was a new--I didn't know any of this stuff," right?
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   He said, "Yeah."
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   I mean--and from his personal experience, he says,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   "Sometimes you could tell if they're really serious,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   or sometimes you're just annoying, they didn't see if you would leave," you know?
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   And wanted to see, like, if you're really serious about this sale.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.400]   And so he was able to distinguish between the two,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   and that was the difference between him and I.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   I didn't know that.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   All I saw was their hostility, and I said, "Okay, we're done.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   You know, this is not worth it," where he saw a great potential.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   And the difference between his boldness and my timidness was his knowledge.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   He knew something that I did not know.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   Our confidence to enter the throne of grace is directly linked to
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   our personal confidence of knowing who Jesus is.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   If our confession is simply a verbal confession,
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   it's just--we just admire him from a distance.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   There's reasons why people are timid.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   They're timid to preach, they're timid to share,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   they're timid to walk in their faith,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   they're constantly concerned about what other people are going to think,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.400]   and a lot of that is directly linked to a lack of conviction,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   lack of confidence that we have in Christ.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   He says the confidence is based upon the blood of Christ,
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   the confidence is based on the new and living way,
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   the confidence is based on the fact that we have a great high priest.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   And our personal conviction and boldness is directly linked
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   to having a deep personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   In fact, remember in Acts chapter 4, verse 13,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   the apostles are preaching with boldness in front of the same people
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   who crucified Jesus.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   These are the same disciples when Jesus is going to the cross,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   they were in fear and hiding and locked the doors,
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   and they disappeared because they were confused.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   Why would our Messiah go to the cross?
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   They didn't make any sense.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   But now, after the resurrection, they recognize who he is,
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   that even in death they cannot contain him,
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.400]   and all of a sudden they're preaching the gospel with boldness,
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.400]   and the people who are watching this and hearing this,
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   this is what they say in observation, Acts 4, verse 13.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   "Now as they observed the confidence of Peter and John,"
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   again, the confidence of Peter and John,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   "and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men,"
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   "they were amazed and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus."
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   Their boldness didn't come because of their education,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   their boldness didn't come because of their experience,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   their boldness came, and even the non-Christians recognized
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   that their boldness came from being with Christ.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   It's our approaching Christ, it's our nearness to Christ,
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.400]   it's our strong near to Christ,
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   is what gives us conviction, what gives us confidence.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   So the first and foremost, the most important call of any sinner
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   is to draw near to Christ.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   The most important call of any Christian,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   before you make disciples, before you go overseas,
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   before you feed the poor, before you march for justice,
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   first and foremost thing that God demands and calls us to apply
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   is to draw near to Him.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   We are of no use when we're not near Christ.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   We are of no use, we cannot bear fruit according to Scripture
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   if we are not remaining in Christ.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   Doesn't matter how hard you work, doesn't matter how much you give,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   it doesn't matter what your experience is,
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.400]   it just doesn't matter, because true fruit comes from Him.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   He says we are to draw near with sincere hearts,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   to draw near in full assurance,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   with the hearts sprinkled and bodies washed by the blood of Christ.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.400]   And all of this is simply to say, without hypocrisy,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   not pretending, not pretending on the outside
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.400]   and inwardly have nothing to do with Christ,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   that we have a reputation of godliness
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   and you have no power in your life,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   because all of our connection with Christ is public,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   that all of our righteousness is for other people to see.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.400]   But when the cameras are not on, when people are not looking,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.400]   you have no personal relationship with Christ.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   That's all that this means.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   With a sincere heart, with full assurance of faith,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   with our hearts, inner persons, and our bodies,
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   internally and externally, washed in the blood of Christ.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   You see in Isaiah 29, verse 13, God says to the nation of Israel,
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   "And the Lord said, 'Because this people draw near with their words,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   they honor me with their lip service,
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   but they remove their hearts far from me,
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   and their reverence for me consists of tradition learned by rote.'"
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   Meaning it's just tradition.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   It's more superstition. It's not real worship.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   It's not really drawing near to God.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   You see, when the Bible says and commands us
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   to seek God with all our heart,
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   it is not possible to seek God casually.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   If you really understand what it is that you're seeking,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   if you really understand who it is that you're asking,
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   either you seek Him with all your heart,
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   or you're not seeking Him at all.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   See, in Psalm 119, verse 10,
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   "With all my heart I have sought you;
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   do not let me wander from your commandments."
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   Jeremiah 29, verse 13, "You will seek me and find me
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   when you search for me with all your heart."
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   When we draw near to God and seek God,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   we're not asking for lunch.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   We're not asking for, you know, we have a hard relationship,
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   and can you fix that for me?
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.400]   You know, like, we're not asking for a better job.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   I mean, again, not that he doesn't care about all of that stuff,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   but there's no urgency in any of that,
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   because, you know, if you have financial issues,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   get a job.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   Work harder. Invest better.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   If you have relational issues, stop being selfish.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   You know, work on your personality.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   There's, like, so many things that we can do,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   and say, well, you know, there's things that I can apply.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   And so, whenever we seek God,
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   we seek God in things that we can do ourselves,
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   and then we just sprinkle Jesus on it, right?
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   In the beginning and at the end,
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   and God, can you make this better?
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   But we seek God for things that only he can give us,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   and only he is the author of life.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   And so, when we seek Christ, we seek him for life,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.400]   and nobody seeks God casually for life.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   Just like a man who's drowning,
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   if he recognizes the urgency of his situation,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400]   the desperateness of his situation,
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   he doesn't simply ask.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   He doesn't simply ask for the rescuers to come and say,
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   "Hey, hey, I'm drowning.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   If you don't come in the next five minutes,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   I'm going to drown and die."
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   You will never see somebody who's drowning
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   asking for help in that kind of manner,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   because he recognizes his urgency.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.400]   He recognizes his desperate need.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   So, you will, if somebody is drowning,
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   he recognizes that he will be yelling and screaming.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   He will do anything that he needs to do
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   to get their attention, because it is life or death.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   Remember what Paul told Timothy?
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   To watch your life and doctrine carefully,
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   and if you do so, you will save yourself and your hearers.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   Your life depends on it.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   It is not possible to seek God out
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   and draw near to him casually.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   If you are seeking him casually,
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   it's because you do not recognize
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   what it is that you are asking,
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   and you do not know who it is that you're asking of.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   By nature, drawing near to God
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.400]   requires urgency.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   Not because God commands it,
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   but that's the truth.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   That's the fact.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.400]   That's why in Joshua 24, verse 15,
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   Joshua says to the nation of Israel,
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   "If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   choose for yourselves today whom you will serve,
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   whether the gods which your father served with
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   which were beyond the river,
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   or the gods of the Amorites
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   in whose land you are living.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   But ask for me and my house,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   and we will serve the Lord."
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   See, Joshua was tired of the Israelites
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   who were going back and forth
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   to serving the idols when it was convenient for them,
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   and then coming back to God
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   when it was convenient for them.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   So what Joshua is saying is,
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   you need to make up your mind.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   Who are you serving?
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   Who's your Lord?
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   Who do you follow?
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   See, I think one of the biggest challenges
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   that we have in our modern-day church,
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   we have churches filled with people
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   who never made up their mind.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   They've decided to come to church.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   They've decided to maybe sign on the dotted line.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   They've decided to become members.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   They've decided to be identified as Christian.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   They are admirers of Christ,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   but they're not followers of Jesus.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   That's what he's referring to.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   You can admire him from a distance,
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   identify as a Christian,
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   stand before the throne of God,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   and God says, "That had nothing to do with me.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   "You used me as superstition.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   "You used me as some vending machine
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   "to help you with your sorrow
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   "because you were lonely,
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   "because you were having a difficult time,
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   "because you were sick,
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   "because you were having business problems.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   "You wanted me to help you with your life,
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   "but you never surrendered your life to me.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   "Choose you this day whom you will serve."
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   First and foremost, drawing near to him.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Do you know him from a distance?
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   Is the only relationship that you have with Jesus
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   is a corporate relationship?
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   You know him in the context of a community,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   and so that gives you some sort of assurance
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   that somehow you are in the presence of God?
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:01.400]   Well, that is not the Bible, the God of the Scriptures.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   The God of the Scriptures demand
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   that if this is what we believe,
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   the door was not opened for us so we can admire it.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   The way to the Holy of Holies was not opened
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   so that we can say, "That door is huge!"
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   And we thank God that he opened the door.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   So maybe sometime in the future,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   if I want to visit, stick my feet in,
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   go check it around, check the sea,
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.400]   kind of like we're tourists,
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.400]   wanting to see what it looks like,
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   but we never go in.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   We're not dwelling in the presence of God.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.400]   He is not our pursuit.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   All we are are admirers,
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   but we're not followers of Christ.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   See, the first and most important imperative
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   that every Christian needs to embrace
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   and decide for ourselves is,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   "Am I following Jesus?"
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.400]   And again, I may sound like a broken record.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   The question is not, "Are you coming to church?"
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   The question is not,
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   "Are you a member of Green Community Church?"
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   The question is, "Are you following Jesus?"
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.400]   Is Jesus, his voice, his teaching,
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   do you believe this, and are you following Jesus?
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   And let me get to the second one,
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   and the second one is not going to be as long.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   If that is your case, we draw near,
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   and as we draw near, he says,
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   "Let us hold fast the confession."
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   In other words, unswervingly, unbending.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   If this is what you believe, that we are to persevere.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   Hebrews 2, 1, "For this reason,
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   "we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   "so that we do not drift away."
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   Man, you know what we need to do to drift?
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   Nothing.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   Do nothing.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   If you're not clinging to Christ
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   and actively drawing near to Christ,
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   you're drifting, you just don't know it.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   We're already drifting.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.400]   Drifting doesn't require any effort.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   Here's what you need to do to drift.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   Get a job, wake up early, go to work, get paid,
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.400]   and with that money, pay your bills,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   and with some of that money, enjoy yourselves.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   Come to church, serve a little bit,
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   have fellowship, attend Bible study,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   take a little trip,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   donate a little money here and there,
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   and then just casually walk along in life.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   And that's all you need to do is to drift.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   That's all you need to do.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   If we're not actively pursuing Christ,
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   you're already drifting.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   We just don't know.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   That's why he says to hold fast, do not bend.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.400]   We cannot fight for our opinion
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   and so easily compromise with the truth.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.400]   You know, we're willing to march,
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   we're willing to stand up,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   we're willing to protest,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   because this is my political opinion.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   But when it comes to the truth of the gospel,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   where it's literally life and death, eternal,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:08.400]   we're timid, we're quiet, we're submissive.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   What he's saying is,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   with the truth, we should be bold.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   With truth, we should be confident.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   With truth, we should be willing to sacrifice.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   With our opinions, we should be gracious.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   With our opinions, we should be quiet.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   With our opinions, we should not be fighting.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   But with the truth, he says to hold fast.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   Do not bend. Do not compromise.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   2 Timothy 4.2, "Preach the word, be ready,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   in season and out of season.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   Do not turn from the word.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Do not compromise.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   Do not cut the sharp corners.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Do not only give them what's palatable.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   Give them the truth, even if they don't like it.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   Even if they get offended.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   Even if you lose friends.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   He said, do not turn from the word to the left or to the right.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   Because true life is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   That's what he means by hold fast.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   No matter what the consequence.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   Because God is faithful.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   You know what God is faithful means?
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   Because, again, because of our cultural baggage,
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   our false understanding of Christ,
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   whenever we hear God is faithful, we automatically think God is merciful.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   Or God's going to be gracious.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   What does faithfulness mean?
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   To be consistent.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   You can rely on him.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   So a judge who is faithful will judge faithfully.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   A police officer who is faithful isn't a police officer who just lets you off the ticket,
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   you know, gets you off all the time.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   He's a good police officer.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   He's consistent.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   You can rely on him.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   So faithfulness simply means he is consistent.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   That's why he says we ought to take this seriously, hold fast this confession,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   because God is faithful.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   And then he reminds us of his faithfulness in the very next section in chapter 10,
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   verse 25, 26, and 28.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   The harshest and the most severe warning in the New Testament is found in the
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   very next text after he says we ought to hold fast because he is faithful.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   And then he describes his faithfulness in verse 26 of chapter 10.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth,
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   But a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   consume the adversaries, anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.400]   mercy on the testimonies of two or three witnesses."
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   And he goes on and on and on.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.400]   God is faithful.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   He is faithful to repentant sinners, to forgive us our sins.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   He is also faithful to judge us of all our unrighteousness who are unrepentant.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   The word glory, literal meaning of the word glory means to be weighty,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   to be serious, that our worship before God,
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   our presence to be able to draw near to him is never meant to be casual.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   We don't come to God casually.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   There's weightiness to what we do.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   There's weightiness to these words.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   If we hear it and we're kind of, you know, like I'll deal with it later.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   It's because you have not seen his glory.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   You do not know him.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   And that's why he says we ought to hold fast for dear life.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   We ought to anchor with Christ for dear life,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   to watch our life and our doctrine closely because if you do so you will
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   save yourself and your here's because our life depends on it.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   And because he is faithful, he will reward the repentant sinners
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.400]   and he will judge the unrepentant.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:57.400]   So there is a greater need in this world than social justice.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   There is a greater need.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   We can make this world a better place with no prejudice, no poor,
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   no sex trafficking.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   We can make this a better place with better politics, better economy.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   And at the end of all of that, all our effort and to create a great
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   society for our children, our great grandchildren.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   But the Bible says that the end of all of that is judgment.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.400]   God calls us to call out injustice.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   God calls us to feed the poor.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   We ought to be compassionate.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   We ought to stand up for those who don't have voices.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.400]   It is the character of a Christian to be gracious and merciful.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   But don't get our priorities mixed up.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   That in our priorities that we try to save a leg while the person
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   is dying, our priority is the gospel and it will always be the gospel.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   Until they come to Christ and they know Christ,
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   this faithful God will carry out his mercy and his justice in this world.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   So as Christians who believe this, we need to first and foremost draw near.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   We need to hold fast.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   And we need to be the light in this world.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   So my prayer again, with all the stuff that's going on around us,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   cling to the word of God, cling to the gospel, cling to Christ,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   that even though they may not understand, that we make it very clear.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   The wrath of God is being revealed against all unrighteousness.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.400]   And the only hope for the wrath of God is the blood of Jesus.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   And I pray that we may be so deeply convicted that we would not drift.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   We're going to take some time for the communion.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.400]   And so let me ask Rachel to come up.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   And if you can take your cup with me.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   And before I ask, we're going to take it together.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   So please don't open it up until we're ready.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.400]   So those of you who did this with us last time, so you'll remember.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.400]   So there's two things that you have to open up.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   So the first one is there's a little plastic thing.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   And that will open up the wafer, okay, the bread.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.400]   And then the second part, the thicker one, has the grape juice underneath.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   So if you rip the first one off, you're not going to -- only the first one,
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   the big one off, you're not going to get to the wafer.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   Okay.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   So don't open it yet.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   We're going to do it together, okay, since we're going to be able to do this.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to read the text.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   I'm going to open it up.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.400]   And then I'm going to give you about a minute or two to read it.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   And then I'm going to give you about a minute to take some time to pray and meditate.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   If you have unconfessed sins, you know, this is the time to confess your sins.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   And if you have, again, whatever that causes you to think that you're participating in an unworthy manner,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.400]   this is the time to come before the Lord and get ready.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   But, again, we don't come to the communion table because we're worthy.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.400]   This is to teach us that our confidence comes from this, what this symbolizes.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   It is because of his flesh, it was because of his body broken for us
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.400]   that we're able to have confidence to enter the throne of grace.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   And so this is what we remember.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   This is what we proclaim.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   And so let's take some time to prepare our hearts.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   And then when we're ready, I'll ask you to come, and then we'll do this together.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   Okay, so let's take some time to pray.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   [Music]
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   [Music]
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   [Music]
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.400]   [Music]
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   [Music]
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   [Music]
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.400]   [Music]
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:10.400]   [Music]
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   [Music]
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   For I receive from the Lord that which I also deliver to you,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.400]   When he had given things, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying,
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   "This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   So the communion table is meant for baptized believers.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   So it's meant to be a kind of like an anniversary,
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   remembering Christ's sacrifice for us.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   So again, if you have not been baptized,
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   we ask that you just kind of observe quietly,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.400]   just watching and thinking through what's going on.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   But again, if you are a baptized believer, we ask you to participate.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   So if you can, again, now open up the top,
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   and take the wafer out.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   And we're going to do it together.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   So don't put it in your mouth yet.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   We're going to do it together.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   I see you.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   Okay, so it's all open.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.400]   Okay, let me pray for us.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.400]   And then after we pray, we'll participate together,
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   and then the worship team will lead us.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.400]   Okay, let's pray.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   Heavenly Father, as we participate in this sacred time,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.400]   help us, Lord God, to recognize the sacredness and holiness, Lord,
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:57.400]   that you have set this apart so that we would not drift from this truth.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:02.400]   As Jesus commanded the disciples and told us to do this in remembrance of him,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.400]   his sacrifice, his love, his holiness, his righteous judgment,
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   and only by the grace of God that we are able to have this confidence
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.400]   to be able to draw near to you.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   Help us, Lord God, to do this in celebration, in thankfulness.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.400]   And I pray, Father God, that the truth of the gospel will never fade in our memory,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   that you would be our greatest and most important pursuit, Lord God, this week.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.400]   So we ask that you would bless this time and unify the church for that sake.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:46.400]   Okay, so let's participate together.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   All right, let us rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   [piano music]
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:15.400]   The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   The agonies of Calvary
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   You, the perfect, holy one, crushed your son
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   You drink the bitter cup reserved for me
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   Your blood has washed away my sin
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:58.400]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:15.400]   [piano music]
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   By your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   Your enemy, you've made your friend
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   Pouring out the riches of your glorious grace
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:45.400]   Your mercy and your kindness, no, no, and your blood
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   Your blood has washed away my sin
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   [piano music]
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   I want to live for you
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   I want to live for you
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   I want to live for you
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.400]   Lover of my soul
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.400]   I want to live for you
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   Your blood
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   Your blood has washed away my sin
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   Your blood has washed away my sin
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.400]   The Father's wrath completely satisfied
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   Once your enemy, now seated at your table
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:02.400]   Jesus, thank you
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   [piano music]
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   So before we end, afterwards again, if you guys can help us clear out and some of you guys take the chairs
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   So if you are thirsty, we have plenty of water in the back, it's really hot so make sure you don't get dehydrated
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.400]   We also have some otter pops that we want to give you to cool you off
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   So I think we have enough, so make sure when you go out there and grab some otter pops
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   And again, don't be ashamed, we have plenty for everybody, it's not just for children
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   It's to keep you guys cool
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   So as you go out there, make sure you get some before you go so that you can stay cool, alright?
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   Alright, let's pray
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:58.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your constant grace
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   I thank you for, just my brothers and sisters, Lord God, in this church where we can run this race together
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   We thank you Father for the privilege that we have to come before you and call you our Abba Father
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   Lord, you know our weaknesses, you know how prone we are, Lord God, to drift
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   So help us this week, Lord, to be anchored in Christ
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   That we would passionately, with urgency, to draw near to you, Father God, more than any other endeavor in our lives
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   I pray that the truth of the Gospel would grip our hearts so strongly
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   That we would be gracious, we would be holy, compassionate
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.400]   In every way, Father, that we would reflect Christ in our lives
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.400]   So whether we eat or drink, truly help us, Lord God, to honor and glorify you
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.400]   Eternal love of God our Father
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   Rest, restore, sanctify the church for the sake of your name
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   Amen
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   God sent his Son
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   They called him Jesus
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   He came to love
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.400]   Heal and forgive
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   He lived and died
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.400]   To buy my party
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   Because he lives
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   I can face tomorrow
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   Because he lives
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   All fear is gone
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   Because I know
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   He holds the future
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   And life is worth the living
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   Just because he lives
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   Amen
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:43.400]   Trash cans all around so you guys can throw that in there
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.400]   Thank you
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   Thank you for printing these
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   No problem
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   The leftovers, can you just keep it on the chair or put it right there
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   I think we have right here
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   God is glorious, oh God
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.400]   Engages our hearts
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   May Jesus Christ be known
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   Wherever we are
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   We ask not for ourselves
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   But for your renown
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.400]   The cross has saved us so we pray
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.400]   Your kingdom come
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.400]   Let's sing it together
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.400]   Let your kingdom come
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.400]   Let your will be done
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   So that everyone might know your name
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Let your song be heard
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   Everywhere on earth
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   Till your sovereign word
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   Call your kingdom
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.400]   Let your kingdom come
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   Give us your strength
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   Give us your strength, oh God
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   Encourage to speak
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   Perform your wondrous deeds
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   Through those who are weak
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   Learn, use, assess, you want
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   Whatever the test
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   By grace we'll preach your gospel till our dying breath
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.400]   Let your kingdom come
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   Let your will be done
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:24.400]   So that everyone might know your name
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:29.400]   Let your kingdom come
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   Let your will be done
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   So that everyone might know your name
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:44.400]   Let your kingdom come
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   Let your will be done
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.400]   So that everyone might know your name
