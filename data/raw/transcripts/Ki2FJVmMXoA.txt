[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   All right.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   Good morning, Breen Community Church,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   both those of you who are here and online.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   I want to give a quick announcement before we
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   get started.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   I think this announcement was already made last week,
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   but I wanted to kind of re-emphasize with all
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.000]   the different things and the rules that are coming down
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.500]   from the government about COVID regulations.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   One of the good news is--
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   I'm sure you may have read it-- the Supreme Court in the United
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   States has declared that religious gatherings are
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.000]   essential, which is--
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   obviously, it's always been essential for us.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.500]   But as a result of that, the rules that are coming down
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.000]   are allowing the church to meet freely, at least on Sunday.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So that's good news for us.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And so nothing is going to be changing for us on what's
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.500]   going on on Sundays.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   The weekday stuff that's going on, we want you to be--
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.000]   we want to just use your own discernment of how
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.500]   to be careful.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.000]   And so there is no regulations that are happening in the church.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.500]   We're just asking you to be sensitive to one another
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.000]   and just kind of be careful and use your own judgment, who
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   you're with and what you're doing things with.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.500]   But as far as Sunday is concerned,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.000]   we're going to be just meeting together as business as usual,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   just kind of give you a heads up on that.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Along with that, every year we have a New Year's activity,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.500]   but we will not be having activities here at church.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.000]   And so therefore, we're going to be moving our New Year's Eve
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   service online through Zoom at 11:30.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So the young parents who have children,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   you can put your kids to sleep and then join us at 11:30.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And then from 11:30 to about 12:30,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.500]   we'll be having service together.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.000]   And take some time to pray as we welcome the new year.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.500]   So this year, it's going to be a little bit different.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   Then next week, we have communion service
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.000]   that we're preparing.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   So again, for every communion service,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   we're asking you to take some time to come prepare,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.500]   maybe even come a little bit earlier than you normally do
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   and take some time to pray and ready your hearts
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.000]   for the communion service that will be taking place next week.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And then along with that, the welcome event
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.500]   that's taking place on Sunday, 12/13.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   Again, if you need to sign up for that,
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   you can ask the welcome table.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   Christmas service outreach that's going on.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.000]   Again, all of that stuff is on Facebook and our app,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.500]   so you can go take a look at that,
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   and then you can sign up for that as well.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   All right, so we'll take a minute to pray
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   and give you an opportunity to give your offering
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.000]   electronically, or again, if you have physical check,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   you can do that after service back there.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.500]   All right, let's pray.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you and praise you.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.000]   We thank you, Father, for sustaining us.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   We thank you, Lord, that we have freedom in this country
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   to be able to worship you with clear conscience,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   that we may truly be able to live peaceful and quiet lives,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.500]   to live in obedience, to honor you,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.000]   to share the gospel with others, Lord God,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   that they also may come to know who you are.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.500]   We pray, Father, that we would not take for granted
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.000]   the privilege that we have to be able to meet together.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We ask, Lord, that our hearts may be filled and ready
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.500]   and prepared, that what we give to you this morning
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.000]   would truly be in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   May your word go forth.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   May it be blessed.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   May the time that we have, Lord God,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   would be a blessing to you, and it would be an overabundance
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   of joy and gratitude in our hearts as well.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I pray for the offering that you give.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   May it be multiplied for the sake of your name.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   [music]
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   [music]
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   [music]
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Church family, let's all rise together as we sing these songs.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   [music]
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   We won't fear.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   We won't fear the battle.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   We won't fear the night.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You will go before us.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You will lead the way.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   We have found a refuge.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Only you can save.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Sing with joy now.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Our God is for us.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Raise your voice now.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   No love is greater.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   [music]
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Even when I stumble, even when I fall,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   even when I turn back, still your love is sure.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   You will not abandon.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You will not forsake.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You will cheer me on with ever ending praise.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Sing with joy now.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Our God is for us.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Raise your voice now.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   No love is greater.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   [music]
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Neither high, neither high nor down
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   can separate us.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Hell and death will not defeat us.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   He who gave his Son to free us
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   holds me in his love.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Neither high nor down can separate us.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Hell and death will not defeat us.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   He who gave his Son to free us
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   holds me in his love.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Sing with joy now.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Our God is for us.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Raise your voice now.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   No love is greater.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Sing with joy now.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Our God is for us.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Raise your voice now.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   No love is greater.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Who can stand against us if our God is for us?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   [music]
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   [music]
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   [music]
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   [music]
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   From the brightness of his glory
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Jesus, the Son of God, descends.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Takes on the nature of a servant.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Jesus, obedient to death.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   The Father willed to crush him
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   as a sacrifice for sin.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   He's satisfied God's justice
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and in victory he rose again.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   You are highly exalted.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   King of the poor and worthy of all praise.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   You are reigning in glory.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Jesus, you're the King of everything.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Exalted to the highest place.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   He's given the name Abba on other names.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   [music]
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Sing it together, "Tomb is Empty."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   The tomb is empty, Christ is risen.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Jesus, the Lamb once crucified.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Angels never cease to worship.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Jesus, in heaven glorified.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   To him belongs.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   To him belongs the power.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   No fist or rod can stray.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   All glory, Lord.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   All glory and dominion
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   to the Lord, Lord and King.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   You are highly exalted.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   King of the poor and worthy of all praise.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   You are reigning in glory.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Jesus, you're the King of everything.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Exalted to the highest place.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   He's given the name Abba on other names.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   [music]
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Our knees will bow.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Our knees will bow.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Our tongues proclaim
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Our knees will bow.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Our tongues proclaim
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   One more time, our knees will bow.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Our knees will bow.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Our tongues proclaim
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   that you are Lord of all.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   You are highly exalted.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   You are highly exalted.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Name above all names.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Worthy of all praise.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You are reigning in glory.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Jesus, you're the King of everything.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Exalted to the highest place.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   He's given the name Abba on other names.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   [music]
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   [music]
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   [music]
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   [piano]
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Though the nations reign,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   kingdoms rise and fall,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   there is still one King reigning over all.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   So I will not fear,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   for this truth remains,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   that my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   None above Him, none before Him,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   all of time in His hands.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   and never stand.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   All the power, all the glory,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I will trust in His name.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   He is here with me.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I am not alone,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   for His love is true.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And He knows my name.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   None above Him, none before Him,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   all of time in His hands.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   and never stand.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   All the power, all the glory,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   I will trust in His name.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Though I may not see what the future brings,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I will watch and wait for the Savior King.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Then my joy come through,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   standing face to face
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   in the presence of His Ancient of Days.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   None above Him, none before Him,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   all of time in His hands.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and never stand.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   All the power, all the glory,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I will trust in His name.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   None above Him, none before Him,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   all of time in His hands.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   For His throne it shall remain
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and never stand.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   All the power, all the glory,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I will trust in His name.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   For my God is the Ancient of Days.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   May we be seated.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   to Hebrews chapter 11,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I'll be reading from verse 8 through 16.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   We're going to jump back into the text
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that I started a few weeks ago.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 8 through 16.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And I'll be reading out of the NASV.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   By faith Abraham, when he was called,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   obeyed by going out to a place
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   which he was to receive for an inheritance,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and he went out not knowing where he was going.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of same promise.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   For he was looking for the city which has foundation,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   whose architect and builder is God.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   even beyond the proper time of life,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   since she considered him faithful who had promise.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Therefore there was born even of one man,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and him as good as dead at that,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   All these died in faith without receiving the promises,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   but having seen them, and having welcomed them from a distance,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   and having confessed that they were strangers
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and exiles on the earth.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   For those who say such things make it clear
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   that they are seeking a country of their own.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And indeed if they had been thinking of this country
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   from which they went out,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   they would have had opportunity to return.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But as it is they desire a better country,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   that is a heavenly one.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   for he has prepared a city for them.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Let's pray.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Christian loving Father,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   we ask that you would help us during this time to,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   not only to hear your word,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   but that you would illuminate us
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   that we may understand and apply it in our hearts.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Help us to be sanctified,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   help us Lord God to truly love you
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that we would not worship you out of habit,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   but we would render our hearts and not just our garments.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So we pray that you would anoint this time for your namesake.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Alright, so we're at part two of the section that we're looking at
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and in the larger section of talking about the heroes of faith.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And so as we talked about before, just as a refresher,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   that chapter 11 is a transitional chapter
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   starting from chapter 1 through 10,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   talking about the supremacy of Christ
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and how we ought to live by faith
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and what does that mean,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   to bear fruit in faith.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And then we get to chapter 12,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "Therefore, concerning all that crisis on who he is,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   that we ought to continue to live our lives in obedience."
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   So chapter 11 is that transition where he says,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "Obedience comes by faith."
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It's not one or the other.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   It's not we believe so it doesn't matter,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   or we're going to work hard and achieve,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   but he says, "No, obedience ultimately comes by faith."
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And that's a theme of every single person that is mentioned here.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And in particular, the life of Abraham.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Abraham is considered the father of faith.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So every single person here in the book of Genesis,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   it says if they have become righteous,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Abraham, what God declared of him,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   he is righteous because of his faith.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And so last week we talked about his calling
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   as he's one of the greatest examples
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   of what it means to live by faith.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   "God called him out," it says in verse 8,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   "Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And that was the first calling of every Christian.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   You cannot follow Christ while maintaining
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   a continued and same relationship
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   that you had with the world before you met Christ
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   because the very first step of meeting Christ
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   is repenting from the life that we lived
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   before we met Christ.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   We don't add Christ to the life that we live.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   We're pursuing the same things, love the same things,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   value the same things, and then we just happen
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   to add Christ on Sundays.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   We didn't go to church and now we're going to church.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   But nothing of our pursuit, nothing of our value has changed.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Hebrews chapter 13, 11, as Christ was crucified
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   outside the camp, he calls every Christian
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   to go outside the camp.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   So again, our justification happens when we recognize
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   that not just an act, not just something that we did,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   but our totality of our life was in rebellion against God.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And so we repent and we turn and we begin
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   to walk toward Christ.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   That's what repentance means.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And so we talked about that last week,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   how Abraham, in order for him to live by promise
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   to receive his inheritance, he first had to leave his home.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   The second part we want to get to is also in this verse
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   where it says, "They obeyed by going out to a place
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "which he was to receive for an inheritance,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   "and he went out not knowing where he was going.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "By faith he lives as an alien in the land of promise,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   "as in a foreign land dwelling in tents with Isaac
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   "and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Not only did he leave his home, the Bible says
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   that living by faith means to live as aliens
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and strangers during this life.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   The theologians call that here and not yet.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Every single Christian who's been called out
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   of this world, we have not gotten home yet.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   We're wandering.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   So I think the best illustration of what our Christian life
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   is like is like the Israelites who are wandering
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   in the desert for 40 years.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   God delivers them from slavery.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   So even though they're wandering as free
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and became a nation, they haven't entered
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   into the promised land yet.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   They see it, but they're wandering.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Every single Christian who's been called out
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   of this world, we live in a period of sanctification.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   We have not been to glory yet.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   We've seen a glimpse of it, but we're kind of wandering
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   in the desert, and again, that's why the theologians
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   call this period here and not yet.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   We've seen a glimpse of his glory.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   We have an idea through the church what his kingdom
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   looks like, but the actual complete deliverance
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   is described when he comes in his glory,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   we will be also glorified with him.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   So the life of Abraham is an example
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   of what our Christian life ought to look like.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   So first thing again that we said was God calls him
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   out of his comfort zone, and then he doesn't enter
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   into his new house.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   He doesn't come out and say, well, he didn't make
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   a trade-off between his hometown of Hur or of Chaldeans,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   and then he wandered and then packed his stuff
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and moved into the land of Canaan and then started
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   building his house.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   The Bible says that he lived the rest of the life
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   that he lived as aliens and strangers in the land.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   He never entered the promised land.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   That's exactly how our life is described
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   in 1 Peter 2, 11.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   He says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   "to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   "against your soul."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Peter writes that in 1 Peter because the persecution
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   was ramping up.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I mean, they were always persecuted before that period,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   but 1 Peter is written around 60 to 65 AD,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   and that's when Nero started doing his crazy stuff
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   where you see movies where you have Christians
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   being dragged into the Colosseum, torn apart by lions,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   and they're all being crucified, burned,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   and I mean, crazy things were happening.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And this was written right as that was beginning
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   to happen, and so they were beginning to feel
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   this pressure that some of them not only were having
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   a hard time having their jobs, taking care of their children,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   but literally being torn apart by animals.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Peter doesn't say, "Hey, trust in God.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   "If you trust in God and if you're faithful,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   "He's gonna show up and deliver you.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   "He's gonna punish these pagans."
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   He never makes that promise.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   He doesn't tell them that they're not gonna die.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   He doesn't tell them that their life is going to be easy.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   He reminds them, "If you feel like you don't fit
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   "in this world, it's because you don't."
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And he actually reminds them, "If the world rejects you
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   "and they're constantly telling you,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "we don't want you among us, and some of them
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   "may simply not like you, some of them may persecute you,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   "and some of them may actually try to kill you,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   "when you face that, remember, you are an alien
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   "and stranger in this world."
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   In fact, this is not the words of Peter.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Peter was taught that by Jesus himself.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   "When I send you out and they don't know you,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   "it's because they don't know me.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   "They hate you, it's because they hated me.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   "They crucified me, so they're gonna try
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   "to crucify you," and he warned them,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   "If you wanna keep following me, you pick up your cross,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   "deny yourself as well, and follow me."
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And it was actually happening, exactly like Jesus said.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And so Peter is repeating the words that he heard
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   from his Savior, that you are an alien stranger.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Don't try so hard to fit in here, because you don't fit in.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   As long as you are a child of God,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   you will always be an alien and stranger
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   while you're on this earth.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You know what's really interesting is that
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   those two words, aliens and stranger,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   in the Greek, alien means para oikos.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   You probably heard the term oikos before, right?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   What is the meaning of the word oikos?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Home, right? House or home.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   So para oikos, para basically means to be alongside.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   That that's not your home, you're alongside the home.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   That's what an alien means,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   that you don't really have your home.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It's kind of like living in a rented house.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   You live there, and you have a place to stay,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   but that's not your home.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   That's what the word alien means, right?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It doesn't mean that you're not living.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   You're there, but it's not your permanent home.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   The word for stranger is para pidmas.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Para, basically it's the same word para,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   alongside pidmas is the word for people.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   So the word stranger means you are along with the people,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   but you don't really belong.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   It's like somebody who kind of immigrated
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   to another country, and you don't speak the language,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   you don't speak the culture.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   You come from another land, but you immigrated,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   and you're staying there for a period.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   That's the word that is being used here,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   para oikos, para pidmas,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that you're living among the people,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   but you don't belong there.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   You have a place to stay, but that's not your house.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And he is reminding them that when the world reminds you
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   that you are an alien and stranger,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and they treat you like you don't belong here,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   he reminds them it's because you do not.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But you know, it's easy to say here,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   but at the core of every single person in this room,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   there is a longing to belong.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   There's a longing to belong.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   There's not a single person here that doesn't say,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   "I don't care where I belong."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   No, everybody wants to belong,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   because God created us that way.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   When God created Adam, he said it wasn't good
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   for him to be alone, and he created Eve as a companion.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And so at the core of who we are,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   every single one of us wants to belong.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Even when people rebel, they rebel together.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   You rarely see people rebelling by themselves.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Even the anarchists have to check with the other anarchists
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   how they are going to be anarchists together,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   because they belong in that group.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Now I realize that even at church, you know,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I realize all these years of seeing people come and go at the church,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   people will come to church because, not the only reason,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   but people will come to church and look for a church
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   where they'll hear the sermon, or they'll see the service,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   or they like the worship and say, "I want to come visit that church."
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And so it'll bring people to the church,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   but usually people will not stay until they feel like they belong.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Okay, and I'm not talking about 100%.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   We're talking about just generally speaking.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I found that through the years, right?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   The Sunday worship will attract people,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   but what causes people to stay is if they feel like they belong.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   See, that desire to belong is innately in us.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   In fact, you guys may remember, some of you, in fact,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   first service, I don't think I had anybody know,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   but remember the sitcom Cheers?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Okay, I'm going to look in this direction to make sure I'm making connection.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   So Cheers was a sitcom back in the '80s,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and it was basically kind of like The Office, right?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   The Office, I forgot when that was.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   The whole sitcom was based upon what was happening at the office.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Well, Cheers was a sitcom where everything was happening at this bar called The Cheers,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   and it was just a bunch of friends that would get together and just talk nonsense.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   There was no purpose. It was just them hanging out, just goofing around,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but it was the hottest sitcom at that time,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and this is their opening song.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Taking your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Wouldn't you like to get away?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and they're always glad you came.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   You want to be where you can see our troubles are all the same.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You want to be where everybody knows your name.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Now, this is about this sitcom, about this bar that people are hanging out with,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   but I think that resonates with every single one of us.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   We're almost Christian, but this is not unique to Christians.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   This is every single human being wants to go where they feel like they belong.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   They care that you came. They care that you didn't come.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Remember the next big sitcom that came around, Friends?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   This is just a bunch of friends hanging around,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   and no specific purpose. It's just their interaction and what their life was like,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   and this is their lyrics.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   So no one told you life was going to be this way.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Your job's a joke. You're broke. Your love life's DOA.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   It's like you're always stuck in second gear when it hasn't been your day,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   your week, your month, or even your year.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   But I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   I'll be there for you like I've been there before.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   I'll be there for you because you're there for me too.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   You burned your breakfast. So far things are going great.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   but she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   that I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I'll be there for you like I've been there before.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I'll be there for you because you're there for me too.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I'll bet you if you--you know, those of you who are thinking--
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   you may not have articulated this, but I'll bet you there's a longing in your heart
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   that is expressed in these very words
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   because that's how God created us--to long to belong.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And that's why this desire to belong--
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   if we see that we belong to Christ and that causes us to run to Him,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   then you're going to bear fruit.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Our whole life is a journey to get to Christ
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and belong in Christ and constantly be reminded that that's where we're headed.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   We're headed home. We're headed where we belong.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   But along with that temptation, that desire
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   causes us to compromise, to belong where we don't belong.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   We say things that we shouldn't say. We do things that we shouldn't do.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   We believe things that we shouldn't believe
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   all because we simply want to belong.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Sometimes we do that even in the church.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   We want to belong so much that we compromise.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   We do things, say things, jump through the hoops and not jump through the hoops
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   all because we all want to belong.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   See, the life that is lived by faith
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   is a life that is constantly wandering because we're not home.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The trouble that you and I get into is that we want home to be here.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And so we are looking for churches. We're looking for neighborhoods.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   We want, you know, even at work, just wanting to belong
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   because that's constantly resonated in our heart and in our mind.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   You know, the problem is that once you belong somewhere
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   and you feel like, "Oh, I feel like I belong. I feel like I found a home."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You know what the next stage is after you feel like you belong somewhere?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Competing.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   You know, if you don't belong anywhere, you're not competing with anybody
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   because you're not comparing with anybody.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   But you long to belong somewhere.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   But as soon as you feel like you belong, "I'm part of this. They know me. I know them."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And then the next temptation is you start comparing.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Right? "Who am I here?"
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And then you start competing.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Just like all the other ambitions you had before you belong,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   and you start comparing and competing. And then the third thing that happens
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   when you're comparing and you're competing, you start collecting
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   in order to fulfill that desire in our hearts.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   So although that essential desire to want to belong
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   is something that God has created inside of us,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   just like the sexual impulses,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   in and of itself is not evil
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   because God created it. God gave it to mankind
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   in order to procreate. But it became perverted
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   because you start expressing it in every other way
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   outside of Christ. So that need to belong
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   is God-given. But when we start to seek for that
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   in places where God hasn't given us, where we don't belong,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   is where we begin to compromise.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   And we deceive ourselves that we think we're living in obedience when we're not.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   See, the first call of Abraham is to leave your home.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And then the second thing that he told him to do is walk by faith.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   As aliens and strangers, Abraham, it says in verse 8,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   did not know where he was going. He didn't jump from one home
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   to another home. He said, "The home is coming, but meanwhile,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   for a hundred years,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   he walked out without ever finding his home."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   You know, whenever we study somebody like Abraham,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   it could encourage us from a distance. You say, "Wow, that guy
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   literally left everything. He was willing to wander in the desert."
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   But when you take a closer look at Abraham's life,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   he's not much different than us. Right?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Right after he's called, promises made, he steps out in faith,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and then in Genesis chapter 12, verse 11,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   right after the promise is made, he's in the land of Egypt,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and he's concerned, you know, because his wife is so beautiful,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   he's concerned that this powerful nation is going to come,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   basically take her, and then kill him.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   So he said, "Well, tell her, tell them you're my sister."
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   So he deceives them. Pharaoh comes and takes her
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   to make her his concubine.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   God's anger is burned because God's blessing is upon this family,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and God supernaturally delivers them.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   And you would think he's learned his lesson in Genesis chapter 20,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   same thing happens. Right?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   He's wandering and in danger,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and the king of Abimelech show up, and he says,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "Hey, you know what? I lived last time. It worked last time.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Let's do it again. Right? Say you're my sister."
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Now, she was a fantastic wife,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   because both times she agreed and she did it. Right?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I can't imagine people doing that now. Right?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But she did it. She did it. She followed, and she went through the system,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   and then God supernaturally delivers him,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   and even though he compromised in order to save his own neck,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I mean, this is the man of faith.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   In fact, if you look closer,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   it says that of Sarah. Right?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Sarah basically did the same thing later on.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   When God promises a child,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   you know, in Hebrews chapter 11, verse 11, it says,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   "Faith, even Sarah herself received ability to conceive."
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Do you remember Sarah?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   When God promised at her old age that she was going to have a child,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Sarah's response was, "Oh, you know, I've been waiting.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Now, you know, I believe you." That wasn't the response.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   She turned around like, "Ha!" Right?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   She laughed in unbelief, and God rebukes her.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And that's why God names the child Laughter, Isaac.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   But here it says, "Because of her faith, she received the ability to conceive."
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   So what happened?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Both Abraham and Sarah,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   their trajectory of life was obedience.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   They were out wandering as strangers and aliens,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   and yet, even though they believed in the big picture of who God is,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   the means in which God was going to fulfill this,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   they had a hard time accepting.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Just like all of us.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   We sit here every single day, every single time we're here,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   we sing praises of His greatness, His glory,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   the God of the universe.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   He died for our sins.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   He was willing to give His only begotten Son, His most precious thing,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   so that rebellious sinners can have a relationship with Him.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   And then what it says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   It's like, "Really? Really?"
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Even though we profess the big picture of what we believe in the grand scheme of things,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   like we believe God,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   but when the rubber meets the road, we have the same problem as Abraham and Sarah.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Will you really do that? If I do this, what if my business doesn't do well?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   If I do this, what if I get rejected from my family?
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   If I do this, will I be accepted?
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Will I be able to take care of my family?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   These were just normal people.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Sometimes we look at these men and women of faith, and they're so far ahead of us,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   they're to be admired from a distance, but not to be followed.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Sometimes we read the New Testament that way.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Apostle Paul, you know, "I've learned the secret of being content in every and all situations."
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Well, that's an apostle.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   We're not that.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   Oh, that's the early church. They saw Jesus.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Oh, those are the reformers, were specially gifted people, anointed by God.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   But when you take a closer look at every one of these heroes,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   they were just normal people who believed in a great God.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   And he calls us, and every single one of us is journeying through this desert,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   longing to be in the eternal promised land.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   But while we are journeying, we will experience being rejected, danger,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   sometimes doubts, struggles, our own personal failures.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   But in the midst of that, he constantly reminds us, "There is something coming."
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   See, that's why the Bible describes the life of a Christian as somebody who walks by faith and not by sight.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Because somebody who is walking by sight, if God doesn't fulfill the promise immediately,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   then he's not worth following.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   In Genesis 12, I'm just going to read starting from verse 1.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   This is the promise that God made with Abraham.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   "Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's house
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   to the land which I will show you.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   So you shall be a blessing, and I will bless those who bless you,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   and the one who curses you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   You look at three things that he promises to Abraham in his descent.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   One is land, right?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   You're going to leave your land and I'm going to take you to another land.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   It's going to be filled with milk and honey.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Did Abraham ever see this land during his life?
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   He did not.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   The only land that he ever possessed was a tiny little cave that he purchased in Canaan to bury his wife.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   So even though he left everything to follow God,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   because of the promise of land, he never experienced it.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   For a hundred years he wandered around and never saw the land.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   And then he says, "I will make you a great nation."
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   That your descendants are going to number the stars in the sand.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   He made this promise when his wife was barren.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Did he ever see the nation come about?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   No. He wandered around for a hundred years.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   In fact, 400 years after he dies, all his descendants became slaves in Egypt.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So Abraham himself never saw this happen.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   He promised him to be a blessing, that he was going to bless them,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   and through them he was going to bless the rest of the world.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Did he ever see that? Did he ever see his nation, the nation,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   going to be multiplied and people going to be blessed through them?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Well, how could he? The nation that was never formed during his life.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   He lived all his life as a wanderer, as a nomad, as aliens and strangers.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   He never stepped foot.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   See, the Bible described for us why he was able to wander.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   I would think that if God didn't fulfill the promise that he made,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   you know, after a year or two years, three, I can wait, right?
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Because we can invest. We all know what investment is like.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   If you put your money in this mutual fund, you know, five years, six years, ten years,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   if it doesn't mature and you don't make money off of it, you're going to pull it out.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   But we're willing to sacrifice and not touch that money because we think the payoff is coming.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   But how long will you keep it in there if the payoff never comes?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   How many of you are going to put all that you have into an account
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   that you can never touch, will never mature, you'll never see, and then just be done with it?
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   You know what it says here in verse 13?
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   All these died in faith.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   All these people who left and was wandering, they never saw the promised land.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   They lived by faith, but they also died by faith without receiving the promises.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   They never received it.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   That is not during their lifetime. And having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   They're continuing to go forward even though they didn't receive it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   But look what it says in verse 15.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   And indeed, if they had been thinking of the country from which they had come from,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   they would have had the opportunity to return.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   At some point in their journey, they realized the prize wasn't the physical Canaan.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Because if that's what they thought, they could have easily returned.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   They would have pulled their money out and reinvested somewhere else.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Maybe put it back in the bank, at least put it in a CD where it's safe.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   If that's what they wanted.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   But at some point in their journey, they realized that Canaan wasn't the promised land.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   That they were seeking a city where the foundation is laid by God Himself.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Not with dirt.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And that's why they were able to walk this journey and live all their lives as aliens and strangers.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Leaving behind what was familiar to them.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   You see, there's so many people who are Christians who came into the faith thinking,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   "I'm going to follow Christ," and then have been waiting month after month, year after year,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   maybe possibly decade after decade, waiting for a payoff.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   But that payoff never came, at least not the way we imagined it.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Life remained hard.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Relationships with other human beings became hard.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Serving the church became hard.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Business became hard. Raising children was hard.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And so every experience, every stage of life, we're waiting for some kind of payoff.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   "I've been faithful. I've been sacrificed. I picked up my cross. I did what you asked me to do."
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   And where's the payoff?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And because payoff never came, and all we were, and all we are experiencing, is rejection.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   I was willing to be an alien and stranger in the beginning.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   I was willing to sacrifice for a period.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   But the rest of my life, this is it? This is the payoff?
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   And so what did a lot of confessing Christians do?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   They went back. They went back home.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   "God's not answering my prayer. He's not fixing my problem.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   I don't feel accepted anywhere."
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   And so they went back home.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   He said, "But Abraham and Sarah, they realized at some point in their journey that their home's not here.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   That the promised land that God promised them was future.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   And they longed for that, and they kept on going, even though they never saw the physical promise happening in their life."
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And that's why it says, "God is not ashamed to call them His children."
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   You know what's interesting with all the COVID that's going on?
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   All the COVID that's going on, you know, so many people are going camping and outdoor and all this stuff.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   And I don't know if you've ever looked into it recently.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   All the camping gear, the price has gone up, you know, like crazy.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Before all this pandemic, you know, the portable toilets were being sold for like $30, $40.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Now it's like in the hundreds. $120, $130 bucks, because it's in high demand.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Portable toilets are in high demand, right?
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   So it's become really popular to go camping and go off-road and all that stuff.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   You know what's interesting?
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Is that people who have permanent homes fantasize about being homeless for a period.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Going off-road, peeing on the side road, sleeping on the floor.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   They fantasize about being homeless.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   What would it be like to be homeless out in the woods for a while, right?
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   And then people who are nomadic, because you don't have a permanent home, you know, that's all you're thinking about.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   We're going to settle down somewhere someday.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   We're going to buy a house and we're going to be in this neighborhood.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   We're going to settle down someday.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   And whether you have a permanent home, whether you're a nomadic just moving around,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   that longing to want to be permanent, to be home, is inside of all of us.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   But the danger is when we begin to think that somehow, somewhere, that if we get this,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   if we buy a home, if we move, if we do this, that we're going to finally belong.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   See, that's why Abraham and Sarah is an example for us as wanderers.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Simply because God promised.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   They left everything and just followed it, knowing that the payoff is coming.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   It's not here.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   You're going to have periods of time when you're going to experience great fellowship,
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   and there's going to be periods of time in your life when you're going to feel like you're rejected by everybody.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   There's going to be periods when you're financially stable,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   and there's going to be periods when you're begging God to help you feed your kids.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   There's going to be periods when you're in full health,
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   there's going to be periods when sickness comes and it just doesn't leave.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   But no matter what we experience here, we're all just wandering in the desert together.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   It says your life is hidden now with Christ.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   But when Christ, who is your life, when He comes, when He comes in glory,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   you will also be glorified with Him.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   That's why the Bible speaks about the second coming of Christ
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   as redeeming His children to bring us back home.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   You know, Moses, Moses is somebody that I always look to for encouragement.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Moses and Paul.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Not because of their great faith, but because, I don't know why,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   it may just be, but I find more encouragement with whining and complaining of Apostle Paul.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   He's wrote some great letters, you know, Philippians, like rejoice always,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   and I get sent to rejoice, like that's great.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   And I read, you know, 2 Timothy, it's like don't be like these people.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   They all abandoned me, they all went home.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Right?
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   And I say, oh man, Apostle Paul.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   And he died like that.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   I look at Moses' life.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   I think he would have been perfectly content taking care of sheep all his life.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   God calls him and said, I want you to go talk to some, I want you to lead my people out.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   And he said, no, no, no, not me.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   I stutter.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I call my brother, and then God actually is angry with him.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   You think I'm calling you because I need you?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I made your mouth.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   So God literally twists his arm.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Right?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Okay, okay.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   He goes.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   And while he goes, the Israelites are not thanking him.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   You know, like when great things happen, it's like God is so good.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   When bad things happen, this guy.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   You sent this guy.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   And he's constantly turning around, and I could tell, like, you know, in the beginning,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   he's trying to be a good leader.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   He's begging God, you have to come with us.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Think about the reputation.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   You sent us out, and if we all die in the desert,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   what was all that trauma for?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   And he's begging God, you have to come with us.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   As if God wasn't going to go.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   I think he was trying to make a great leader.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   But at the end of the 40-year journey that he didn't even want to go,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   after 40 years of whining and complaining of the Israelites,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   right before they enter the Promised Land, they do it again.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   I'm thirsty.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   And Moses just had it.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Like, we're about to enter the Promised Land, and you're going to do this again?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   And he comes to God, whoa, what do you want me to do?
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   And he's like, give it to them.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   God is so patient.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   He goes, and he takes his staff, and he strikes the rock.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Water comes out, they drink it, they're happy.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   But God is upset.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   You did not show me as holy, so you will not enter the Promised Land.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   I remember reading that for the first time, and I was like, what?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   This guy was faithful for 40 years.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   You twisted his arm, and you made him go down this path, and he's at the entrance,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   and he didn't commit idolatry, it wasn't adultery.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   He hit the rock too hard.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   And I'm not exactly sure what he did.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   Because I went and exposited, and I read sermons, and all these people were like,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   from the text, I don't get it.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   What did he exactly do?
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Did he hit it too hard?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   Did he yell?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   Whatever it was, it was too much.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   And God said, you didn't show me as holy.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   Like, what did he do?
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   And I remember reading that for the first time, and I was like, oh, my gosh.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   If he got in trouble, he couldn't enter the Promised Land, because he didn't --
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   whatever he did, he didn't do it right.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   He didn't get into the Promised Land.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   I don't want to do this anymore.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   That's what's going to turn out to be?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   All that drama, and then you soak it up, and then at the end of your life, you can't go in?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   I still don't get it, at least for that part.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   But one of these days, we're going to get to heaven, and we'll probably --
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   I don't know if we're going to be able to see Moses face to face.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   We're too close to the throne of God, right?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   But if we do see Moses in heaven, I don't think Moses is going to say,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   I can't believe he didn't let me go in.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   He didn't let me cross the line.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   For 40 years, that's all I wanted, to get into the Promised Land.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   I wanted to touch that dirt.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   I wanted to set up my tent.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   I don't think Moses is in heaven complaining about where he is.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   If you look at it from God's sovereign perspective,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   God actually delivered Moses, because Israelites entered the Promised Land,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   and you think Israelites were complaining and grumbling in the 40 years in the desert.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   That was the highlight of their life.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   That was when they were the most obedient.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   As soon as they crossed the line, they started setting up altars and started worshipping.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   It's almost like God spared him.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   You know, all the things that we longed for during this 40 years of wandering in the desert,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   where we're not there yet, do you think any one of us will be in eternity and look at this?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Oh, man, how come my business didn't succeed?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I didn't get to go here. I didn't experience this.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   You think any one of us is going to be in eternity in the glory of Christ
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   and going to remember and regret anything that we grumble about here?
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   In fact, sometimes God allows us to experience that to remind us that we don't belong here,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   that our treasure is not here, that this is not our home, that these are not my people.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   One day, if we continue to persevere and walk in faith, that we will be where God called us to be.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   In Philippians 3, 20 to 21, "For our citizenship is in heaven,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory,
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   by the exertion of the power that he has even to subject all things to himself."
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   So again, as we meditate upon Abraham and Sarai, don't just remember the highlights.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Remember, they were people just like us, average people, normal people,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   who believed in an awesome God, that we may leave behind what holds us back
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   and live the rest of our lives as aliens and strangers longing for the second coming of Christ.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up, and I want to introduce a song.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   It's a new song to you that's been around for probably 50 years.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Okay, so only the little bit more aged people will probably know this song.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Okay, "This World Is Not My Home." Yes? Okay.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   The first service, yeah, it sounds--you know, again, Joe usually--
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   the worship leaders usually email me and ask, "Hey, what are you preaching on?
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Do you have a particular song you want us to sing after the service?"
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Some days I don't have one, but this one was very distinct because I remember this song,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   "This World Is Not My Home." They say, "Hey, why don't we sing this?"
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   It's been a long time since I sang this. It's probably in the '80s and maybe early '90s at most.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   I kind of forgot a little bit what the lyrics sounded like, and then I walked in this morning and said,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   "That sounds like country music." So I'm giving you a heads up, okay?
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   So you probably won't fall in love with the music, but pay attention to the words, okay, because it fits.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   Let me read you. "This world is not my home. I'm just passing through.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   Oh, Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore."
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   Why don't we all stand up as we sing this song together?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   [Silence]
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   Oh, Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   They're all expecting me, and that's one thing I know.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Savior, pardon me, and now I offer God. I know He'll take me through, though I am weak at heart.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Oh, Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   [instrumental]
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   Just up in glory land we'll live eternally.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   The saints on every hand are shouting victory.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   Their song of sweetest praise will drift back from heaven's door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Oh, Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   Oh, Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   [instrumental]
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   It's catchy, huh?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   All right, let's pray.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   Reading from Colossians 3, 1 through 4.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   Therefore, if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   When Christ, who is your life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Lord, we pray that this is what we will practice this week. Help us, Lord God, to give our full attention to the things that are coming.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   As you remind us, Lord, we're just passing through, that we are aliens and strangers, Lord.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   So help us, Lord God, that we may long for the home that is coming, that we may long for the fellowship that we will have in you.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   And so we pray that you would give us the faith that you've given Abraham and Sarai, that we may live a life truly worthy of the gospel that you've given us.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   In your name, in your name alone be magnified. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus. He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   He lived and died to buy my pardon. An empty grave is there to put my Savior in.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Because he lived, I can face tomorrow. Because he lived, all fear is gone.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   Because I know he holds the future. And life is worth the living just because he lived.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   So if I can have, again, this side go out through that door. And if you give us just a minute, okay, on this side.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   [Music]
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Father of kindness, you have poured out grace.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   You brought me out of darkness, you have filled me with peace.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Giver of mercy, you're my help in time of need.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Lord, I can't help but see.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Faithful you are. Faithful forever you will be.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   Faithful you are.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   All your promises are yes and amen. All your promises are yes and amen.
