[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.820]   to Psalm 119.
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:12.300]   And I had scheduled to do Psalm 119 for our class,
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.140]   and what was interesting is that
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.760]   I went to the Shepherds Conference the previous weeks,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.760]   and there was a sermon on all of Psalm 119 in one sermon.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.260]   And if you guys know Pastor Mark Dever,
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.820]   who is the leader of the Nine Marks Ministry.
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.180]   He's a well-known author, theologian,
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.500]   and he's an extremely brilliant man.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.980]   But during his sermon, he read all of Psalm 119,
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100]   which took almost 20 minutes, I felt like.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.060]   And I remember thinking, that is a great way
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.020]   to shorten your preparation time.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.380]   I'm not gonna do it now, because that's just way too much,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.740]   even just to go through.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.260]   But his point was, in doing that,
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.740]   this is a profoundly beautiful Psalm,
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.460]   but how many of us have read it in its entirety,
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.600]   and how many of us have actually gone in to dig deep?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.440]   So today, I had to sit and think how to cover this book.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   I mean, even just last week when we covered
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.040]   the Psalm 119, I felt like, gosh,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.060]   that was a lot of material just to go over,
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.540]   a lot of verses just to go over in a one-hour session.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.140]   So what I'm gonna do today is break this down,
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.580]   and we're just gonna go at the pace
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.940]   of making all the observations that we can, okay?
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060]   Now, what I'd like to do then today
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.160]   is to have more of your involvement, okay?
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.820]   That means, someone's, you know, laughed a little bit.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.660]   Yes, we're gonna have some awkward moments
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.620]   when I ask you guys questions,
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.100]   and I'm gonna expect you guys to try to answer
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.820]   and then volunteer to raise your hand
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.700]   and say your answer to the question, okay?
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700]   So please, please let's do that.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.840]   All right, in turning to Psalm 119,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680]   I wanna give you guys some preliminary information
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   about the Psalm, all right?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.060]   So, first, authorship.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.740]   In this class, I remember reading a part,
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.260]   only a portion of Psalm 119 to you,
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.940]   and telling you flat out, hey, it's young King David, okay?
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.420]   He's a young man who wants to love the word of God.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.540]   And then I remember someone asking,
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.540]   well, hey, how come my study Bible says it's not King David?
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.100]   Well, traditionally, okay, by,
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.740]   like, if you go to old school theologians,
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.020]   if you go to Jewish tradition, King David is the author.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.300]   If you were to talk to an individual
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.460]   who is of the Jewish religion, okay,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.860]   not a Christian, but Jewish religion,
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.980]   he would say, Psalm 119 is for sure King David.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.420]   And there are a lot of reasons why.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.420]   So for me, I just, you know, when I read it,
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.620]   I just assume it's King David,
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.500]   'cause that's what I was taught, too.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.020]   I realized there are different views, okay?
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.540]   There is a view that because of the way this person sounds
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.300]   in Psalm 119, the struggles, the difficulties,
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.940]   the pains that he has, it might be somebody
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940]   who is in the post-exilic era,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.420]   meaning Northern Israel has already fallen,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.220]   Southern Israel has fallen to Babylon.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.420]   And if you remember the time of, like,
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.900]   Daniel and his friends, and King Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.300]   who was forcing everybody to obey and worship idols,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.620]   you can imagine how, you know, devastating
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.180]   of a situation that would have been.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.060]   People say, it sounds like that.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.540]   So maybe it's somebody in that post-exilic time.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.260]   Somebody else would say, you know,
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.440]   it seems like it's even worse than that,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.060]   where the word is so far, this person is hungry for it.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.980]   And when were they so eager to reestablish the word?
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.260]   When they were coming back to Jerusalem.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.940]   So not only the post-exilic era,
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.900]   but the era of the return.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.260]   So we're talking like Ezra, Nehemiah, okay?
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.560]   So about 450 BC.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.820]   For me, sometimes that kind of logic, yes, is good,
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.060]   because you read it and you see the content,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.100]   and you say, it sounds like somebody
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.900]   who spoke out of this context.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.220]   For me, I still take the position that it's King David,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.100]   and I wrote for you the reasons why.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.480]   Okay, I'm not gonna go into detail,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.300]   but essentially, comparing one Psalm to another,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.200]   and the fact that this Psalm is, in many ways,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   not only big, but it's meticulously beautiful
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.740]   to a huge scale.
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.980]   And let me make sense of that.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.260]   It's kind of like, you know, somebody who is devoted
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.000]   to writing Psalm, or writing, can write a good essay.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.620]   Somebody who's made an entire career,
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.820]   lifelong career out of writing,
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.740]   will have huge works of art, like huge essays, or books.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.540]   So, in thinking about comparing different Psalms
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.300]   one to another, there's evidence that
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.760]   this kind of meticulous attention to detail,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.300]   beautiful, like, basically this is an art, you know?
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.380]   Shows that it's King David.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.980]   Furthermore, he calls himself your servant,
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.580]   which exists in other Davidic Psalms,
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.860]   and the psalmist mentions that he speaks of God's
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.900]   testimonies in the presence of noblemen and kings.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.220]   He doesn't sound like, you know, just your average leader.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.340]   He sounds like royalty, okay?
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.080]   So, that's just a tidbit about the authorship of Psalm 119.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.860]   Moving forward to the structure of it,
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.160]   this is a massive work, okay?
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.560]   Psalm 119, as many of you guys know,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.720]   because on your Bible, it'll say,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.620]   and break up the Psalm into little sections,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.780]   is a ginormous acrostic.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.700]   You guys know what an acrostic is, right?
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.260]   You know that song, "Love"?
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.900]   L is for the way you look at me.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.540]   O is for the only one I see.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.320]   It's like an acrostic, L-O-V, it all sounds,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.460]   it all matches, it's a way to remember,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.580]   it's a way to express, it's a way to say something
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.620]   in a very artistic way, okay?
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.140]   You guys don't know that song?
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.980]   You do know that song, okay, thank you.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.260]   Now, here's the thing, though.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.820]   The thing is, 22 stanzas, okay?
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.020]   22 stanzas, because it follows the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.900]   And so, if some of your translations
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.340]   have actually the heading, it'll say,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.580]   Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, that's the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.380]   And what's beautiful about it is,
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.920]   all eight verses in each stanza
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.120]   begins with that Hebrew letter, okay?
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.380]   And so, if you think about it,
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.540]   to write something like this, and in this way,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.100]   at the time, it must have required such great attention,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.460]   and required such dedication, okay?
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.940]   And I ask you the question,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.980]   what can we deduce by something like this?
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.180]   For me, I sit and I think, gosh,
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.620]   for us, we live in a generation
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.940]   where spontaneous, in-the-moment speech
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.700]   is seen as most real and genuine.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.700]   Like, to be real, it has to be unedited,
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.180]   it has to be raw.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.900]   For this, I think King David, psalmist,
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.300]   took time meditating, and essentially saying,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.180]   I'm thinking about God and his word to such a detail,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.500]   he is not only writing such a huge work of art,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.240]   but essentially, he's kind of like saying,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.180]   from A to Z, from front to end,
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.620]   I've thought about this, you know what I mean?
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.740]   And so, to think about the devotion, dedication,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.380]   and the time just to work at this,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.380]   you appreciate the fact that this individual
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.020]   has thought deeply about God and his truth, okay?
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.820]   That's an encouragement to us.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.340]   For us who live in a time when our deepest thoughts
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.780]   come from like one-liners, from a generation
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.360]   where if a sermon goes for an X amount of time,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.380]   we zone out, and all that kind of stuff,
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.340]   this psalm is a huge work of art
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.900]   showing the depth of devotion and thought
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.560]   that the psalmist has, okay?
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.900]   So that being said as a way to think about it,
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.020]   let's read a section and really dive into it.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.440]   So let's go into verse one,
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.900]   and we're gonna read to verse eight,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.500]   and our goal today is to really dive into
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.100]   verses one through 17, or one to 16 and stop there, okay?
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.740]   But I'm gonna break it up into two sections.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.740]   The first, how blessed are those whose way is blameless,
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.700]   who walk in the law of the Lord.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.060]   How blessed are those who observe his testimonies,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.100]   who seek him with all their heart.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.920]   They also do no unrighteousness, they walk in his ways.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.580]   You have ordained your precepts
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.940]   that we should keep them diligently.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.100]   Oh, that my ways may be established to keep your statutes.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.560]   Then I shall not be ashamed
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.180]   when I look upon all your commandments.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.140]   I shall give thanks to you with uprightness of heart
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.180]   when I learn your righteous judgments.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.180]   I shall keep your statutes, do not forsake me utterly.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.420]   Okay?
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.740]   Now in this, in verses one and two,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.180]   the author begins with a questioning statement.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.380]   It's in the form of a question,
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.900]   but it's basically a statement that causes us to ponder
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.360]   what it means to truly be blessed.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.140]   I want you guys to take a moment
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.580]   to scan down verses one through eight,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.840]   and please describe the person who is blessed
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.980]   according to verses one through eight.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   So, skim it really quickly, and when you're ready,
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.800]   raise your hand and tell me,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.060]   in verses one through eight, what is the description,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.160]   just one, of an individual who's really, really blessed?
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.420]   Okay?
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.580]   (silence)
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:59.420]   All right.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.140]   Giving you a little time to scan.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.180]   Who's got a, yes?
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:11.100]   Whoever sees God and obeys his statutes.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.540]   Great, whoever sees God by obeying his laws,
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.300]   his statutes.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.580]   Any other descriptions?
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:26.140]   Yes.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.580]   His way is blameless.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.420]   What else?
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.980]   Yes.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.420]   They do know unrighteousness, okay?
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.900]   So obviously this first section has,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.980]   a theme to it here, as it describes the individual
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.340]   who's really, really blessed.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.740]   And I want you guys to take a moment
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.300]   to think about that, okay?
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.740]   For us, when we think of an individual
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.460]   who's been really, really blessed by God,
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.860]   is that the same kind of concept that you have?
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.180]   That's an important question to ask.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.780]   As a matter of fact, let's think about this
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.220]   for a little deeper.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.020]   He says, twice, in verse one and two,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.180]   how blessed, oh gosh, how blessed are you?
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.900]   If we see people with lots of wonderful,
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.500]   beautiful children, we might say, how blessed.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.740]   You must be so blessed.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.100]   If we see an individual who's just worked so hard
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.380]   to achieve a significant milestone in their life,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.540]   whether it be getting accredited,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.140]   whether it be having a degree,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.900]   and then once they achieve it, what do they say?
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.980]   I feel so blessed, okay?
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.220]   Well, is that all the kind of same perspective
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.260]   of what it means to be blessed?
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.820]   Someone answered for us, when you think of blessed even,
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.860]   what do you think of in the first place?
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.300]   What do you think of when you think blessed?
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.900]   What comes to mind?
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.820]   Just anything that comes to mind.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.540]   It could be something from other parts of scripture
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.700]   or just what you think.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.640]   The Beatitudes, great.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.540]   Blessed are those, right?
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.380]   Who are meek, who suffer for righteousness,
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.500]   blessed are the peacemakers, et cetera.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.340]   Good.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.180]   If you've ever heard a sermon from the Beatitudes,
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.180]   they probably spend time on the concept of being blessed.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.420]   The Beatitudes goes completely contrary
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.340]   to what we think is typically blessing.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.500]   Lots of material, safety, security,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.260]   and having their life be a success
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.700]   in the lives of the world.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.900]   So what does blessed mean there in the Beatitudes,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.020]   and what does blessed mean here in Psalm 119?
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.100]   If you can write it down, the Hebrew word is assure.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.180]   Assure.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.340]   Now, the concept in the Hebrew word here
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.300]   and the Greek word in the Beatitudes is really similar,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.860]   and what it means is content and happy.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.520]   And I find that incredibly surprising.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.200]   Okay?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.320]   Again, it just goes against and shatters
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   the expectations that we have in our day, in our life.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.760]   When we think about happiness
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.160]   and the things that we pursue in order to be happy,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.120]   does this fall in line?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.960]   Does it fall in line for you?
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   And it really goes to shatter what we think about all this.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.120]   And so it reminds me of a passage that we studied
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   at the very beginning of our whole series
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.560]   in Psalm 1, verses one through three.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.880]   "How blessed is the man who does not walk
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.080]   "in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   "nor stand in the path of the sinners,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.120]   "nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.920]   "But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.960]   "and his law he meditates day and night.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   "He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water."
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.620]   And so as we think about this,
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.080]   the concept for this psalmist, for King David,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.440]   to feel truly blessed is not so much to win something,
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.120]   it's not so much to achieve something in life.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.960]   For him to feel really, really blessed
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.320]   is to be in the model,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.440]   to be in the form of God's word,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.240]   to have God's truth be evident in his life,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.000]   to have God's presence as near as possible.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.380]   And what you'll see is that
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.920]   that's what he talks about, really.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.880]   When he considers, again, in verse one,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.840]   when he considers how blessed are those
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.080]   whose way is blameless,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.120]   I always really had a problem,
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.860]   to tell you honestly, with the word blameless.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.520]   You know, while I was getting ordained,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.500]   the elders led me through that passage on leadership,
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.280]   and there's that word again, blameless, you know?
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.240]   An elder in the church or a leader in the church,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.120]   a servant of God, a deacon, must be blameless.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.840]   And that's always like, okay,
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.060]   who's really blameless, you know?
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.680]   And there's a sense in which this passage, for me,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.640]   just continues to challenge every standard.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.800]   Who is the one who is blameless?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.300]   Who is the one who is, you know,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.980]   where no accusation can come?
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.520]   Well, the concept here, when we think of blameless,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.120]   if you can write down,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.900]   it's the individual who is complete and has integrity.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.580]   In some of your other translations,
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.320]   it'll just, rather than saying blameless,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.900]   it'll use the word integrity or sincerity.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.860]   But he describes for us that concept
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.020]   because that concept is hard.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.820]   If you just leave it at that and say,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.780]   every single one of you must be blameless,
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.100]   which is true, that concept is difficult.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.180]   But he describes it and he says,
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.460]   the one who is blameless is the one
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.020]   who walks in the law of the Lord.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.320]   He's the one who observes and keeps his testimony.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.820]   And so, you think about that a little bit,
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.860]   and then you get a little better picture.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   And I am all the more convicted and challenged
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.500]   to think about all this.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.420]   One of the things that we all struggle with
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.140]   is maintaining and keeping alive
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.820]   that passion and faithfulness to God.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.900]   One of the things that's hard is not so much
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.460]   in the moment when there's an event,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.620]   when there's a praise meeting,
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.940]   to go and worship with all your lungs and heart and voice,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.940]   when there is a conference to go and study
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.800]   with your notebook and with everything laid out
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.420]   and you're receiving all that good food.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.220]   What's actually hard is having a longevity, right?
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.140]   Persevering in growth and study and walking with God daily.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.540]   And so, how does he describe it?
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.300]   He describes it as the one who is healthy,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.700]   the one who is complete, the one who has integrity
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.540]   is the one who maintains this
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.820]   and keeps a walk faithful to the Lord.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.660]   And if you think about that,
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.360]   wouldn't that be a huge blessing?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.520]   I mean, for you guys, just think on your own personal level.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.920]   I feel like, you know, as you get older,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.060]   you don't have huge ups and downs, so to speak,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.840]   but you have this slow progressing,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.740]   like neglect, neglect, neglect, and oh, shoot.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.880]   And then, you know what I mean?
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.480]   When we were younger, we had super highs.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   We went to high school ministry stuff
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.420]   and we were like, yeah, give you everything, God.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.720]   And then, boom, you fell to like, I don't know,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.080]   like stealing and petty theft,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   or you fell to like lying or cursing
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.680]   or compromising with a girlfriend or boyfriend.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.480]   So you had these huge ups and downs.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.920]   Wouldn't it be a blessing in your own,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.280]   do you have that kind of heart where you say,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.560]   wouldn't it be a blessing to be able to walk with the Lord
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.800]   steadily in fervency for a long time?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.000]   So this is the way the author is thinking, okay?
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.820]   All right, now looking at the next verses,
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.020]   let's read verse three all the way down to verse seven.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.940]   They also do no unrighteousness, they walk in His ways.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.380]   You have ordained your precepts
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.700]   that we should keep them diligently.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.060]   Pay attention now to verses five through seven.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:20.020]   Oh, that my ways may be established to keep your statutes.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.900]   Then I shall not be ashamed
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.500]   when I look upon all your commandments.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.400]   I shall give thanks to you with uprightness of heart
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.920]   when I learn your righteous judgments.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.120]   I wanna ask you a question here.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.240]   Now, to say in general,
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.520]   by keeping the Lord's word, we're gonna be blessed.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.600]   That's really general stuff, right?
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.600]   But from this little segment that we read,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.160]   what other benefits does the, you know, does King David see?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.380]   I'm just gonna say King David, okay?
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.240]   What other benefits does King David see
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.800]   from keeping God's word?
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:04.680]   What are the results that's gonna come about in his life
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.440]   by means of keeping His word?
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.300]   Yes.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.920]   He won't be ashamed.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.400]   What else is there?
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.160]   (pages rustling)
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:27.860]   He's going to be able to praise and give thanks to God.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.880]   What else is there?
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.160]   Be acknowledged.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.380]   I like that, be acknowledged.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.860]   In the NASB, translate that established.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.220]   If you think about that, my goodness,
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   aren't some of those things
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.820]   perhaps some of the deepest longings
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.220]   that we have in our hearts?
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.080]   For us to be able to rid ourselves of a guilty conscience,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.540]   what Grace mentioned, in clearing our conscience,
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.420]   where we can enter into a place of holiness,
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.320]   we can enter into a place of other holy people,
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.180]   other saints, without the sentiment of guilt
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.900]   on our conscience, that's huge.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.740]   To be able to freely worship
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:20.240]   with clarity, with sincerity, with integrity, that's huge.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.840]   The clarity of conscience is so valuable,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.140]   and then to be acknowledged by God,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.240]   to be established, not by your own work,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.100]   but to be established by the Lord.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.880]   That's a lifelong goal.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   That's like the goal of our existence,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.900]   to be pleasing to our master
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.700]   and for our master to acknowledge and establish us.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.600]   There's nothing more secure than that.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.200]   So as you think about this,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.900]   you'll realize the psalmist is really seeking,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.520]   through all of this, the best benefits.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   And lastly, what's interesting to me in verse eight,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   verse eight, he says, "I shall keep your statutes,"
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.480]   and he almost makes like a declaration.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.600]   I'm gonna obey your word.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.460]   And then he says, "Do not forsake me utterly."
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.680]   That's weird, isn't it?
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.200]   It's like, by being with God and his word,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.120]   and by soaking it in, I'm gonna be established,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.720]   I'm gonna have a clear conscience, I'm gonna worship.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.160]   And he says, "Please don't forsake me."
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.540]   Oops.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.580]   So the answer to the question I was supposed to ask you,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.140]   what does a psalmist ask in verse eight?
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.520]   The answer is, "Please do not forsake me utterly."
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.520]   And what's really interesting about that
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.840]   is that, you know,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.560]   that idea of, "Please do not forsake me utterly,"
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.480]   it's something that we would wonder in our perspective
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.520]   as like, that's kind of a weird thing to pray, isn't it?
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:00.320]   I'm gonna go on a like a trail of thought with you guys,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   okay?
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.880]   I'm gonna start off with the statement.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.700]   I believe us being so privileged,
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.840]   sometimes we don't see the depth of the privilege we have.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.040]   Okay?
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.800]   And I think that's generally true for us.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.480]   From King David's perspective, King David loved the law.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.160]   When he mentions the law of the Lord,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.640]   when he mentions testimonies, the precepts,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.120]   the words that sometimes he uses,
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.740]   words like Torah, the law is Torah.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.580]   So what is he thinking?
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.400]   He's thinking about those first five books,
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.880]   he's thinking about the words of God
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.240]   that's been passed down.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.220]   And if you read Deuteronomy,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.340]   what's really going to be evident is this,
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.580]   blessings and curses, okay?
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.740]   And so here's a trail of thought.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.060]   For King David, he's thinking from his perspective
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.500]   that when you are with God through his word,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.740]   you're going to receive the blessings,
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.400]   the good countenance of the Lord.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.100]   But when you disobey and you break the covenant fellowship,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.280]   what do you receive?
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.700]   Curses.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.340]   Curses from God Almighty.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.860]   That's his circumstance, that's his perspective.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.780]   And so you can imagine, we don't get it.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.620]   Because why?
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.100]   Because we live in the Hebrews 13,
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.420]   I will never ever forsake you, I love you always,
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.640]   never ever will leave you, that kind of terminology.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.800]   But you know where the profound truth is?
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.180]   The curses that are spoken of in Deuteronomy,
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.460]   we do realize it's still true today, right?
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:34.380]   The curses that are spoken of in Deuteronomy
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.020]   has been taken care of by Christ only for the saints.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.060]   But for the world at large, those curses exist today.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.540]   And they will be enacted when Christ returns.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.980]   And so what I'm saying is this.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.980]   Sometimes I read statements like,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.860]   do not forsake me utterly, God,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.060]   and it's kind of like, why is he saying that?
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.820]   You know?
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.500]   In what context would he even say that?
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.180]   And part of the reason why I ask
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.020]   is because maybe I take for granted the fact
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.780]   that God's promise to never forsake,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.620]   to never leave, to never abandon us,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.860]   that promise is for saints in Christ.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.120]   And that's an amazing truth, okay?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.340]   So in thinking about that,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.380]   that is why I believe he's saying that,
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.660]   is because for an Old Testament saint,
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.380]   the promises of blessings and curses are readily evident.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.220]   Okay?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.220]   Now, to make this a bit more devotional,
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.340]   can we make this our own prayer?
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.100]   Where we commit in the same tone,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.660]   with the same kind of,
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.580]   by repetition and by the beauty of the psalm,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.340]   you see his heart, right?
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.860]   And so let me ask you a question like this.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.740]   How would you summarize verse one through eight?
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.420]   How would you summarize his view?
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.460]   Okay?
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.180]   King David's view of his relationship with the word.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.100]   So take a moment to think about it,
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.460]   and share with us, how would you summarize that?
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.980]   It's always hard to get like everything in a sentence,
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.980]   but think about what was repeated, you know?
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.480]   What was emphasized, and try to hit that as a summary.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.960]   Who's got one?
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.900]   How's about,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.620]   I'm gonna call on a few people,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.980]   just for the sake of time, okay?
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.820]   How's about,
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.540]   Jack?
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.780]   (laughing)
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:26.380]   Okay, blessed are those who pursue righteous living.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.980]   Great, I saw a hand over there.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.820]   Mobley?
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.940]   Great.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.340]   (laughing)
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.140]   So he said, oh how happy are those
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.180]   who obey you wholeheartedly, so please be with me.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.340]   Okay?
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.180]   Great.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.000]   As you guys think about that,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.660]   when was the last time you prayed from that perspective?
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.580]   Like, Lord, I, like make it personal.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.920]   I am thoroughly blessed when I am in your word.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.580]   You know, personal prayer.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.260]   Lord, I am complete opposite of thoroughly blessed
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.440]   when you're far.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.860]   Do not be far from me, Lord.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.540]   You know, please be with me is the same way as saying
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.940]   do not be far from me, Lord.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.220]   Like, when do we, you know, when do we pray
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.260]   with that kind of perspective?
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.940]   And if you do, that's awesome.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.780]   Continue doing it.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.180]   If you don't, pray those prayers this week.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.300]   God, I agree with King David.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.220]   When I'm thoroughly blessed is not when
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.360]   work is going all right.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.160]   When I'm thoroughly blessed, you know,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   when I have the heart of the word of God,
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.740]   when I feel the leading of the spirit,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.300]   so that work I see through the lens of scripture.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.080]   I'm thoroughly blessed, Lord, when you're with me.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.860]   I'm thoroughly blessed, Lord, when you establish me
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.260]   by your word, my highest blessing is to be taught
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.420]   and led by your scriptures.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.800]   Pray that, okay?
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.080]   So, as a summary, as like a quick thing,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.940]   I would name, you know, that first stanza,
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.580]   blessed by the word, or something like that, okay?
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.880]   All right, let's move on to the second stanza, Beth, okay?
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.240]   Number nine, or verse nine.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.140]   How can a young man keep his way pure?
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.640]   By keeping it according to your word.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.260]   With all my heart I have sought you.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.580]   Do not let me wander for your commandments.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.820]   Your word I have treasured in my heart
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.220]   that I may not sin against you.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.480]   Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.600]   With my lips I have told of all the ordinances
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.280]   of your mouth, I have rejoiced in the way
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.640]   of your testimonies as much as in all riches.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.920]   I will meditate on your precepts and regard your ways.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.200]   I shall delight in your statutes.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.000]   I shall not forget your word, okay?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.280]   Now, just by way of making sure the emphasis
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.860]   is on the right thing, typically the first words
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.040]   that come out, right?
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   Typically your introduction has your what?
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.040]   Proposition statement.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   Typically your introduction has that hook, so to speak.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.080]   And so even with biblical writing,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.720]   typically what's placed first has a huge emphasis.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.920]   And he starts off with a question,
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   which is strike a chord with all of us.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.060]   How can one keep his way pure?
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.080]   What an awesome question.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.800]   You know, I feel like that question has been answered,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.160]   or not asked, asked multiple times,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.520]   but I don't know if sometimes there is a definitive answer
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.080]   that people cling to.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.820]   What I mean by that is, even when I counsel people,
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.420]   and again, it's none of you here, whatever,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.240]   but even when I counsel people, especially young people,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.540]   sometimes I'll ask, like, man, I struggle with this,
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.720]   I struggle with that, and I feel apathy,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.880]   I don't feel motivated, and there's a lot
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.440]   of typical struggles that we have in our spiritual walk.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.760]   And sometimes they'll ask me, like,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.040]   what's a practical thing you can do?
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.900]   Especially when it comes to young men and lust, you know?
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:03.120]   Especially when it comes to things that are really addicting.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   Young men and video games, young men and money.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.520]   I feel like young men have lots of passion
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.260]   for various things, and sometimes it's just
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.280]   incredibly difficult to overcome them.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.140]   And so they'll ask, like, what's a practical thing?
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.520]   Like, what's something that's, you know,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.600]   really kind of doable?
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.320]   And the reason why earlier I said,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.640]   I don't think there was a substantial answer to that
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.840]   is because why do we ask a follow-up question like that?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.920]   As if the word of God wasn't practical.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.100]   As if maintaining a passion to receive
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.200]   and have the word of God in our hearts
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.360]   is not something that's tangible, right?
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.100]   And so here, he answers the question by saying,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.200]   by keeping it according to your word,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.320]   with all my heart I have sought you,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.160]   do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.400]   Your word I have treasured in my heart.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   There is a question here automatically.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.160]   Do we have a level of confidence?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.060]   Perhaps by experience, do we have a level of confidence?
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.980]   Okay?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.940]   You know, experience builds a great amount of confidence,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.540]   and what I find is that perhaps there's a lot of timidity
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.140]   and a lot of lack of confidence in the scriptures,
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.320]   and maybe it's because it's a lack of experience.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.040]   You know?
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:29.900]   This, a little while ago, I was really egging this guy
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.280]   to go pursue a girl, and I was like,
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.040]   you should go tell her, man!
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.600]   Life is short!
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.240]   Tomorrow's not guaranteed, you know?
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.940]   And he was just really timid.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.360]   And what's funny is, just thinking about
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.600]   how our generation does the communicating
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.040]   of like, hey, I like you, it's weird.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.760]   It's already super timid, you know?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.800]   If you think about it, it's like,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.120]   hey, do you wanna go out?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.960]   Go out where?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.040]   You know, it's like, it's really broad and vague
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.960]   because you don't wanna be way too direct.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.840]   That already shows a level of timidity, you know?
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.220]   It's like, just saying, hey, I like you,
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.400]   that's just too weird, you know?
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.960]   It's just too awkward.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.480]   So not a lot of people do that.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.120]   Well, the story goes, again, the guy mustered up
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.160]   enough courage, and you know, he has to like,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.040]   wrap himself up so before he's,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.240]   he's like totally doing, like he's going boxing
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.200]   or something, but once he does that,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.120]   now he feels a level of what?
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.080]   Confidence.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.320]   You've done it once, then you can do it again.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.460]   And then, next thing you know, it's like,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.000]   whoa, man, you need to calm down
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.420]   'cause you're just way too confident.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.900]   But I tell that story because even with the word of God,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.180]   there's a sense in which you face various circumstances
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.820]   in your life where it's not just external hardships.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.180]   Sometimes it's internal hardships.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.580]   You don't know why you think the way you do.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.700]   You don't know why you're so down.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.220]   You don't know why you have evil thoughts.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.000]   You don't know why you do what you do.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.520]   And you have such lack of self-control.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   In those moments, do we have experiential confidence
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.920]   in the Bible as a way to victory?
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.760]   You see what I'm asking, right?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.120]   Like, we can have a level of confidence from afar
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.640]   by people telling us you have to go there
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.660]   in order to get advice and counsel
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.080]   to overcome your situation.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.760]   It's another thing to say, last time I went to the Bible
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.240]   and I had victory.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.400]   And so this passage is telling us
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.340]   to have that kind of confidence in the word of God.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.300]   How can a young man keep his way of career?
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.260]   That question is asked.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.220]   And the answer needs to be a confident
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.660]   by having the word of God in my heart.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.740]   Another thing that I found really, really insightful,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.340]   really, really convicting,
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:57.020]   is this main point by a gentleman, my John Fable.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.220]   I read his commentary and I found out
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.780]   that he wasn't from our era,
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.280]   but he was from the time about the 1600s.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.040]   And he made this point in his commentary,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.100]   and he says, "For many, there is a,
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.640]   "basically there is like a struggle
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.020]   "with having a confidence in the Bible,
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.620]   "but then there are those who don't even ask
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:21.620]   "the practical question, how can I remain pure?"
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.540]   And so I quoted this from him saying,
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.060]   "Let him," he's saying, any young man or anyone of us,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.620]   "Let him not shrink from the glorious enterprise
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.780]   "of living a pure and gracious life,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.820]   "as though unattainable.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.900]   "Let him inquire how obstacles may be overcome,
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.260]   "but let him not think that he knows the road
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.140]   "to easy victory or dream that he can be kept
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.100]   "by his own wisdom."
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.580]   What he means is, don't go to extremes.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.860]   On one end, some of us are so timid,
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.700]   we think we always fail.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.780]   We have a fail-ism, failure-ism or something,
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.380]   where it's almost like our frame of mind
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.900]   is always we just are going to fail.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.580]   And he's saying, "Do not give up that glorious task
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.500]   "of seeking purity to the degree where you will ask
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.180]   "and seek, how can I be pure?"
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.100]   Right?
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.500]   And on the flip side, don't be so arrogant
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.700]   to think it's not a big problem.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.700]   It's not a big problem in my life.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.160]   It's not a big problem in my church.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.860]   We've got this under control.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.340]   You see what he's saying, right?
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.900]   He's saying, "Ask."
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.740]   And then, a gentleman by the way of a name,
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.340]   Walford, in the New International Commentary
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.500]   of the Old Testament, Psalms,
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.820]   he says, "A young man is unaccustomed to the road,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.900]   "so he must not be ashamed to ask often the Lord
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.460]   "who is ready and able to instruct."
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.660]   I thought that was really wise as well.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.240]   Again, this is, I'm looking at this Psalm devotionally,
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.040]   and it's doing a number on my heart.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.160]   My desire to be pure.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.280]   How strong is that desire?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.080]   That first I would think to ask, "How can I get there?"
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.400]   And how strong is that desire to be pure
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.920]   that I would ask, "How can I get there?"
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.400]   Frequently.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.200]   And be unashamed of saying, "You know, I don't know.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.280]   "God, lead me."
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.480]   And isn't that the humble posture
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.680]   that we should have before God?
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.320]   God, you instruct me through your word.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.600]   You guide me, and humbly we learn and walk
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.480]   the way that he reveals, right?
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.560]   So again, this passage teaching us about this question.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.600]   How can a young man keep his way pure?
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.960]   By keeping it according to your word.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.560]   Now let's take an observation in verse 10.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.320]   He says, "With all my heart I have sought you.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.600]   "Do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.120]   "Your word I have treasured in my heart,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.360]   "that I may not sin against you."
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.960]   He contrasts two concepts here.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.600]   One of treasure and one of wandering.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.840]   When you guys think of wandering,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.080]   what's the kind of imagery that you get in your mind?
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.600]   When you think of wandering,
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.200]   what kind of imagery do you get?
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.880]   Or what comes, just word association.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.360]   Wandering, go.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.280]   (laughs)
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.560]   Wandering, meandering, it's like,
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.420]   do do do, and just kinda strolling, okay?
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.260]   What else?
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   Wandering, absolutely lost.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.980]   Good, thank you.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.020]   I like that word a lot.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.120]   So I'm gonna use that as a way to segue, okay?
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.700]   We wanna take notice of that word,
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.220]   do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.900]   Because beautifully, if you've noticed what he's been doing,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.580]   is he's been asking God prayerfully
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.420]   for certain things to be done on his behalf.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.540]   Things like teach me, guide me.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.260]   But he also asks in both positive and negative ways.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.260]   He asks positively things like,
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.780]   yes, teach me and whatnot,
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.540]   and then he asks things negatively,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:13.200]   such as do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.220]   And I asked that question about
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.060]   what does wandering for you make you think about?
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.060]   And it's really that concept of being lost, okay?
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.220]   And if you juxtapose being lost
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.020]   as opposed to what he's talking about
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.040]   in this next couple verses about treasuring.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.600]   If you think of treasure, what do you do?
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.840]   You put it in a box, in a box, in a box, in a box,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.760]   in a bank, and then you say, you know, there's my treasure.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.580]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.220]   And so he juxtaposes these two ideas,
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.240]   and he says, don't let me just idly,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.940]   like ignorantly, in a lost fashion,
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.180]   go about life, wandering off from your path.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.300]   But as a treasure, as I would dedicate
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.000]   to make sure the treasure is safe,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.220]   as I would dedicate to make sure
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.380]   the treasure is exactly where I know it ought to be,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.460]   with that kind of attention to detail,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.880]   let me treasure the word of God in my heart, okay?
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.880]   So let me wrap up by calling us and challenging us.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.680]   These first two big stanzas, really,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.360]   what he's doing is expressing
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.500]   his perspective and his attitude.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.120]   And what we found is words like observe,
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.920]   keep, walk, treasure, rejoice,
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.280]   meditate, and delight in your word.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.080]   The challenge is, can we commit to doing that?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.560]   I'm not asking you right now, you know,
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.360]   like give me an assessment and survey
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.120]   of what you're doing with your Bible study
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.240]   and what you're doing, you know,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.300]   like with your word intake and all that kind of stuff.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.440]   But can we commit in our hearts to doing that?
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   Can we, I guess the whole idea is muster up our willpower
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.720]   and say I'm not going to allow
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.480]   regular patterns of living the world.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.240]   You just go to work Monday through Friday
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.380]   and you crash on the weekends.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.960]   I'm not gonna allow that kind of pattern to dictate my life.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.120]   But with great sense of commitment,
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.720]   with almost a sense of promise,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.200]   can we commit to doing what King David is talking about?
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.120]   Where he says that he will treasure, right?
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   Where he says that he's going to speak of these.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.960]   He says, "With my lips I have told of your ordinances.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.560]   "I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.760]   "as much as in all riches, and I will meditate,"
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.020]   and he says, "I shall delight."
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:56.280]   I feel like we're very hesitant to make commitments
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.520]   and we're very hesitant to make like
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.480]   statements like that, right?
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.240]   And rightly so, because in wisdom,
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.560]   scripture tells us, look, you're a man.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.320]   You're not able to keep like promises
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.520]   for the next month and the next year and stuff like that,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.680]   so don't make vows, you know,
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.240]   that's what the scripture says.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.000]   But I think there's a difference between,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.020]   and I kind of wrote this in your thing,
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.400]   there's a difference between a heartfelt commitment
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.880]   to the Lord and just a vow to anybody.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.380]   There's a difference between, first of all,
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.720]   making a vow directly to God
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.980]   and making a vow to your neighbor.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.280]   There's a huge difference, right?
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.960]   Just as there's a difference when you just
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.080]   not only make a vow, but when you speak,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.320]   when you speak to a neighbor as opposed to your God,
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.160]   there's a difference.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.760]   When I speak to my child as to, let's say,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.800]   the President of the United States, there's a difference.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.520]   To whom you make a commitment and to whom you make a vow
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.800]   makes a huge difference.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.460]   And then the content of what you do, right?
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.160]   The content of what you're vowing.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.280]   When, you know,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.440]   oh, I can't remember his name all of a sudden,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.600]   but in the book of Judges,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.940]   the guy who vowed to sacrifice his daughter.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.880]   Jephthah, thank you.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   Making that kind of commitment,
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   essentially what you're putting down is a promise.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.420]   Something almost of, you know,
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.800]   if you make a, you have a debt and then you have your,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.040]   what's that word, collateral, you know what I'm saying?
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.800]   The content of his vow, was that something
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.640]   in his control?
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.460]   Absolutely not.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.800]   Was that something God called for?
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.000]   I don't think so at all.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.160]   But when we make a commitment like,
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.520]   God, I'm going to be saturated by your word,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.900]   I'm going to live according to your word,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.280]   I'm going to obey you,
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.720]   that is both proper and called for by God himself.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.560]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.260]   And so we don't have a problem with making vows
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.100]   when it's in the appropriate time to the appropriate person.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.340]   Just like we make vows to, you know, in work,
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.160]   we make commitments, just like we make vows
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.800]   and promises to our spouse when we get married.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.280]   You know, just recently I was doing a marriage counseling.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.760]   Hey Jack, do you remember your waiting vow?
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.600]   (laughs)
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.280]   Just kidding, I told him I was going to make fun of him
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.040]   and put him on the spot.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.080]   But you know, it goes like, you know, I take,
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.480]   I, you know, Jack or Mark, take X and so
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.440]   to be my lawfully wedded wife.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.080]   And you know, I promise to love sacrificially
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.000]   as Christ of the church, I'll protect, provide,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.760]   you know, the whole thing, for better or for worse,
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.200]   sickness and in health, you know what I mean?
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.360]   That is a serious vow, right?
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.240]   You're listing off things you're going to do from your will,
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.840]   not by feeling, but volitionally by your will.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.520]   I will protect you, I'll take care of you,
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.840]   I will love you sacrificially.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.680]   Are those not commitments and promises?
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   Absolutely, they are commitments and promises
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.400]   of the most solemn kind.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.680]   But at your wedding, to your wife,
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.220]   you better make those promises, right?
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.380]   Likewise, I think if we are too afraid
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.360]   of making commitments, I don't think it's healthy, why?
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.320]   Because I think we should make commitments
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   in appropriate places to our God.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.760]   To say, God, I will obey you.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.320]   God, I will surrender to follow your commandments.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.800]   Those are things I think we need to subjectively,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.080]   and subjectively meaning me, I need to say it.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.840]   I can't wait for the pastor to be like,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.280]   hey, you need to commit to God's ways and his word,
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.120]   and be like, mm-hmm, you know?
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.300]   I need to go pray that to the Lord.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.040]   God, I will delight in your word.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.080]   You know, by the way, just kind of a way to wrap this up.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.440]   When I think about
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.680]   something that he says here,
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.400]   which I think is pretty profound.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.560]   (inhales)
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:02.080]   I think I left it out.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.160]   All right.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.260]   Well, if you look at the passage,
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.540]   and he talks about that idea of wandering,
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.480]   in verse 10, he says,
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.400]   "With all my heart I have sought you.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.920]   "Do not let me wander from your commandments."
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.200]   And he says, "Your word I have treasured in my heart,
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.240]   "that I may not sense against you.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.640]   "Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes."
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.960]   Okay?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   So, kind of wrapping this all up,
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.120]   think about this for a moment, okay?
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.980]   The scenario looks like this.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.580]   The psalmist, King David, has to seek God
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.420]   with all his might and strength in his heart.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.500]   What kind of scenario do you think he's in?
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.100]   Something easy?
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.040]   Something nice and slow going?
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.480]   Something good pace?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.360]   Something that everybody can handle?
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.440]   No.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.320]   He's probably in a lot of distress.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.080]   He's probably under persecution,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.760]   which he was throughout most of his life.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.520]   He's probably in even personal angst.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.320]   So, he has to seek God with all his heart.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.100]   What's more, he's wandering.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.920]   There is a place for us that we need to be,
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.440]   but for some reason we always
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.240]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, wander, right?
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.900]   Like the nation of Israel.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.640]   And if I think about myself,
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.120]   my mind wanders so much.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.160]   My mind wanders.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.320]   I could be studying and an email will pop up
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.840]   and then down low there'll be like,
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.480]   men's schools from Wayfair.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.140]   And I'm like, oh, look at that, power tool.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.520]   30 minutes go by, like what am I doing?
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.280]   Go back to studying, you know?
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.800]   We wander because of materialism, just like that.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.440]   We wander because someone says something
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.480]   and now we're angry and our minds are completely gone.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.040]   We wander because of personal lust.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.000]   We wander because sometimes we're just afraid.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.320]   You can sit there thinking about the future.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.280]   What's gonna happen next year?
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.240]   What should I do with my job?
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.200]   What should I do with this?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.120]   And then blah, your mind is distracted.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.000]   We wander all over the place.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.840]   And you know what's been interesting?
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.240]   Just, this has been like on my head
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.840]   so I'm just gonna share it.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.200]   My mind has been not all together
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.680]   for the last entire week and it's been weird.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.040]   I haven't slept well at all.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.580]   Like I've been waking up at like two in the morning
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.000]   with nightmares and I haven't been able to go back to sleep.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.520]   This is a silly nightmare.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.040]   Silly nightmare is I'm on the top of a water slide,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.120]   like a big one, and as the water is rushing,
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.240]   you know the water is all rushing down like this
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.560]   and then there's like a little wave
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.480]   that's created artificially by the water.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.160]   And I see these little shorts.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.440]   It's Emmett.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.520]   He's upside down and his shorts are up.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.440]   And I'm going, oh my God, somebody go help him, you know?
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.480]   And I look over at the lifeguard and he's on his phone
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.280]   like dillydallying, I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.200]   Look at my baby.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.920]   And then he throws his phone and he jumps
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.400]   but he doesn't clear the edge of the pool
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.160]   and he snaps his leg in half.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.120]   It's like, goosh, and I'm saying, ah.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.760]   So I run down the slide and then I go grab him
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.280]   and then thankfully he's like, ooh, he's still alive.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.560]   And then I'm looking for Bia and I'm like,
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.800]   what are you doing, where are you, you know?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.640]   And then, you know, Bia jumps into action so she jumps.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.080]   I'm like, no, no, you have to stay out
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.360]   because I have to pass you, Emmett.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.840]   I can't get out of the pool with him in my hand.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.760]   And then she jumps in and I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.960]   So I woke up going, what are you doing?
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.600]   (laughing)
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.960]   Yeah, and I just haven't been able to go back to sleep.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.120]   But my mind has just been distracted so bad.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:20.760]   So bad that if I try to go back to sleep,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.680]   the next thing is Bia's there and I pass Emmett
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.840]   but I look over there and Yoshi's drowning
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.680]   out the other end.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.720]   I'm like, no, I can't sleep, right?
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.840]   Well, what's really interesting is
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.520]   I shared with some of my close friends
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.080]   and they're all like, let's interpret this stream.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.920]   (laughing)
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.520]   And then I'm just like, yeah, I'm just not going
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   to pools for a while.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   But, you know, I read through all of Psalm 119
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.680]   and it actually quieted my heart.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.920]   Psalm 19 says things like, if I devote my ways to the Lord,
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.600]   God will enlarge my heart.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.480]   If I devote my ways to the Lord,
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.440]   God will give me what?
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.520]   Security.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.080]   To be established by God is actually security.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.440]   Once I started thinking of what's the most frightening thing
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   in all the universe?
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.180]   It's, again, losing your children,
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.780]   it's hurt that's caused to the people you love
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.940]   and the fear that could devastate you, literally crush you.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.300]   And once in a while, I just have this morbid fear
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.220]   of stuff like that.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.380]   I don't know if you guys can relate but,
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.620]   and I know people who've struggled with that.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:33.820]   And I'm gonna say, the way to overcome those things
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.180]   is like, you idiot, it's not gonna happen.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.660]   No, kids can actually drown at pools really easily,
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.980]   you know, if you ever read the stories.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.980]   The way to think about that is have a different perspective.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.860]   The Lord God is in control, he is sovereign.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.120]   Who can protect me?
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.600]   Who can protect my children?
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.860]   Who cares more for my children than I do?
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.380]   Who is ever watching, unlike the lifeguard,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.720]   but who is ever watching?
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.800]   My God.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.060]   Where do I learn that stuff?
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:00.960]   The scriptures.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.500]   That's what I'm saying is like, we really need to be
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.100]   in the word to fight every wandering thought,
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.380]   fear, distraction, temptation, and lust, amen?
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.740]   And the word of God is proven to suffice,
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.860]   it's proven to lead us the right way.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.360]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:29.300]   Father God, we wanna thank you for your truth.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.560]   God, without it, we would have no lamp to our feet.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.100]   God, without it, we wouldn't have the refreshing waters,
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.820]   and we would be thirsty.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.480]   God, without your word, we won't know you.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.660]   So Lord, help us to open up our eyes, open up our ears,
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.100]   that God, we might see wonderful things from your word.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.260]   And God, help us not to simply be people of
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.060]   wanting knowledge to be prideful,
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.300]   but God, help us to realize the words are yours.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.820]   And so if we revere you,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.140]   we should have to respect what you say.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.180]   And God, if we don't want to sin against you,
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.160]   then we should respect and listen to your command.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.220]   And I pray, Father God, again, that as we develop
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.340]   and grow in our faith and our hearts to please you,
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.300]   help us then to be people who thoroughly, thoroughly rest
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.040]   and dwell upon your words.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.640]   God, I wanna thank you for our time.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.800]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.640]   Okay.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.040]   For homework, if you guys can do the next section,
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.880]   two sections, two stanzas,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.320]   Psalm 119, verses 17 through 32,
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.800]   and there's gonna be a lot of repetition.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.240]   I hope you guys circle or, I don't know,
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.500]   do something to mark the repetition stuff, okay?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.320]   So note down every synonyms for the word of God
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.480]   in this section.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.900]   You notice that it says stuff like the testimonies,
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.960]   the statutes, ordinances,
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.160]   and think about what that kind of reflects.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.260]   What are the main concepts?
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.960]   Learning about the psalmist's perspective about the Bible,
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.520]   what can we learn from that perspective?
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.040]   So we're seeing through his eyes, right?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.480]   What can we deduce and then have as our own?
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.960]   And then also, are there any actions
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.280]   that the psalmist asked God to take on his behalf?
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.600]   Please complete this chart also for objective
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.040]   and subjective descriptions about God's word
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.180]   from verse one to 32.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:34.160]   So objective is like your commands are true or faithful,
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.360]   okay, it's just objectively saying a description,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.540]   a character trait of the Bible.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.320]   But then to say your word is to my delight,
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.720]   it tastes sweet like the honeycomb,
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.800]   that's like an experiential subjective thing, right?
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.280]   So if you guys can write that in just for homework,
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.160]   and then we'll come next week and discuss some of that.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.160]   All right?
