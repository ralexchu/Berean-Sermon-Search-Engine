[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   Wild fields and floods,
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   Rocks, hills and plains.

[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   [Music]
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   Joy, a speaker for joy.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   In all the glowing hells,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   No tongue can tell.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   Joy, a speaker for joy.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   Rises in my soul, never lets me go.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   He rules the world with truth and grace.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   And makes the nations prove
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:12.840]   The glories of His righteousness, And wonders of His love,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:26.360]   And wonders of His love, And wonders, wonders of His love.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.040]   Joy!
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:41.920]   And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   Joy!
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   And speak of the joy, Risen in my soul, never let me go.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   Joy!
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell.

[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   And speak of the joy, I was going where no tongue can tell.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.640]   In the same region there were shepherds out in the fields, keeping watch over the flowering
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.840]   lights.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:44.880]   And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.760]   and they were filled with great fears.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.680]   And the angel said to them, "Fear not for behold, I am an angel, and there is a great
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.200]   joy that will be for all the people."
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.840]   For unto His wondrous name, the city of David, the Savior was Christ the Lord.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160]   And this will be a sign for you, you will find a beauty raptist born with cause, lying
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.440]   in a manger.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   And he had woven the angel's mouth to set it at me, and was praying God is saved.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.520]   Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace among those whom He has pleased.
