[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   - Good morning.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and also those of you who are online.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Again, we wanna give a few announcements,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   but first of all, if you notice that our parking area
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   between the two buildings,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   we put a little ramp between the two parking lots,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   so for those of you who have little children
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   that you're wheeling around
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   so that you don't have to go over the rocks,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   so make sure you use that
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   when you're coming between the two parking lots.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And also, if you notice that we got rid of
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   most of the rocks on that side,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   so for safety reasons for the children,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and also so we can have easier access
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to the other building, okay?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So that area is being used for the cafe,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   so if you guys wanna go, you happen to come earlier,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and you want to sit there and do stuff,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   you're welcome to go into that room on the outside.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   In fact, the cafe, the people who run the cafe
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   told me that they're gonna be having a soft lunch
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   starting next week,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   so if you wanna go there and grab a coffee or something,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   you're welcome to go there before or after the service, okay?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   All right, and so along with that,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   we're asking that the people who--
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   we're gonna try to reserve that side of the parking
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   for the young parents with small children
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   that you have to bring across the street
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   so that you don't have to do that,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   so, you know, every time we cross the street,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I mean, it's safer.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   So if you have strong legs, you don't have children,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   you don't have a handicap placard, you know,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and you're more than able, please use the other side.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But if you have small children,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and you're, you know, you're wheeling them around
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   or small children that you need to kind of watch,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   we're gonna try to reserve that side of the parking.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   We did that for that side because when we didn't have it,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   so try to reserve that for the families if possible, okay?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   We have a couple announcements that we're gonna give,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   and so Pastor Peter Chung,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   who is the pastor for the family ministry,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   he has an announcement,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and right after that, Grace Chu has an announcement
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   for the sisters ministry, okay?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   - Oh, good morning, everybody.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   We were supposed to start this last year,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   but it got derailed by COVID.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   We're gonna be starting a newlywed ministry
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   in the family ministry department,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   but our definition of newlywed is a little bit different
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   where the slide says like three years and under,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   but basically if you got married on and/or after
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   January 1st, 2018, you can come to this thing.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   What we're gonna do is we're gonna have a launch
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   on May 15th with a barbecue.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   The older family members are actually gonna cook you meat.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So if you are a newlywed individual,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   just come together with your spouse and sign up online,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   and then we'll see you there,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and then you'll find out what FAM 245 is all about,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   what the vision is and stuff like that, all right?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So that's May 15th at 1030.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   So if you're a newlywed,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   go ahead and check that out on the website, all right?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Thank you.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   - I'm sorry, I'm so out of breath.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Good morning, my name is Grace,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and this announcement is for the ladies.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   How many of you guys have been to our fellowship
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   or film-alship in the past?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   (laughs)
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Lee, okay, yes, in spirit.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   We have our first ever women's event, and that's coming up,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   and this is the first event we've had
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   since pretty much the quarantine and lockdown,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   so we're so excited.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   We hope you guys can come.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   This is gonna be open from high school all the way up,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   so all across the board, all affinity groups for women.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Film-alship is basically film fellowship.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   We get together, we watch a film,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   have a really good intentional time.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   There is breakfast, so come hungry.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   This year, we're gonna be listening
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   to Darlene Diebler-Rose.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Does that ring a bell for anybody?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Well, I'll be honest, I actually hadn't heard about her
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   until recently, and she's amazing.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Corrie Ten Boom, anyone else hear about her?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   She's pretty much like Corrie Ten Boom,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   just removed from a different World War.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   She's phenomenal, and a missionary in Papua New Guinea.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Her information is up there,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   so the time's gonna be from 8.30 to 12.30.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   This is gonna be an in-person event.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   There is a virtual option,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   but we do encourage you to come in person.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It is very different meeting sisters
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   and fellowshipping in front of each other
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   versus doing it via Zoom.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It's gonna be May 22nd.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   The last day to sign up is the 8th.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   If you have any questions, please contact Carrie Chang,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and you can sign up via Facebook or through email.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Thanks so much.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   (applause)
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Okay, we have a couple more announcements.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   First of all, we have a members' meeting next Sunday,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   and it's going to be virtual.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   This is probably gonna be the last time
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   that we have a virtual members' meeting,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   hoping that things will, you know, as it is right now,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   progressing into the yellow phase.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And so for this one, at 2.30 p.m.,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   we're gonna be online,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   so watch for the Zoom link for the members,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   so make sure you're there sharp.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And we're gonna start right at 2.30.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It'll probably last about an hour, so that's next Sunday.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Also, right after our praise time,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   our sister Jennifer Lynn is gonna come up,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and she's gonna give her testimony,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and she'll be baptized this morning, okay?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   So let me pray for our offering, give you an opportunity to give,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   and then again, if you have physical checks that you want to give,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   we have a box in the back as well.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   that we have to be able to worship you,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   to honor you, to glorify you,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   and the brothers and sisters that we have to run this race together.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Help us never take for granted what it is that we have,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   that our worship may be an overflow
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   of abundant thanksgiving that you give us in our hearts.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I pray, Father God, that you would bless this time of worship,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   bless this time of giving,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   bless this time of fellowship in your word,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   that all of it, Lord, may be given to you in spirit and in truth.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   We pray that you would bless this offering,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your glory.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   [piano music]
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Would you please stand with us as we continue our worship?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   [piano music]
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Come now, Father, every blessing
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   To my heart to sing thy praise
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Streams of mercy never ceasing
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Call for songs of loudest praise
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Teach me some melodious song
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And sung by flaming tongues above
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Praise the mountain, fix the pond
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Bountify redeeming love
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   [piano music]
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Here I rest, here I rest my ever-beating
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Hither by the river by
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And I know my good pleasure
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Safely to arrive at last
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Jesus saw me when a stranger
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Wandering from the fold of God
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   He to rescue me from danger
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Interposed his precious blood
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   [piano music]
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   O to grace, O to grace
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   How great a debtor
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Daily I'm constrained to be
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Let thy goodness like a fetter
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   By my wandering heart to lead
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   No to wander, Lord, I fear Him
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Come to me, the God I love
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Seal it for thy courts above
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   [piano music]
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   O that day when free from sin
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I shall see thy loving face
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   O that day when I'm washed clean
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I will sing thy sovereign praise
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   I will no longer dare
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Take my ransom, stole away
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Send thy angels now to carry
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Me to Ramzah endless day
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Come my Lord, no longer dare
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Take my ransom, stole away
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Send thy angels now to carry
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Me to Ramzah endless day
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   [piano music]
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I will rest in thy promises
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   My confidence is your faithfulness
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I will rest in thy promises
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   My confidence is your faithfulness
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Faithful you are
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Faithful forever you will be
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Faithful you are
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   [piano music]
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   [guitar solo]
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He's the Father of kindness
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Father of kindness
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   You have borne and raised
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You've poured me out of darkness
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You have filled me with peace
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Giver of mercy
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   You're my help inside of me
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Lord I can't help but sing
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Faithful you are
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Faithful forever you will be
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Faithful you are
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   [guitar solo]
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Beautiful Savior
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Beautiful Savior
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You have borne and raised
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You've pulled me from the ashes
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You have broken every curse
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   You're my Savior, Redeemer
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You have sent this kind to me
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Lord I can't help but sing
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Faithful you are
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Faithful you are

[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Faithful you are
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Faithful forever you will be
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Faithful you are
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Yes you are

[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   All your promises, all your promises
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Are yes and amen
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Thank you Lord
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   All your promises are yes and amen
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   [guitar solo]
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Amen, may we sing it.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Hello church family, my name is Jennifer Lin and I'm a second year student at UC Irvine.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Today I have the privilege to share my testimony.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I was born and raised in Taiwan for 14 years and I did not hear about the story of Jesus, not until I was a second grader.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   One time my mom's friend invited her and my family to her church and that was my first time being exposed to a Christian community.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I did not seem to like the community at first because I did not understand why people were so serious and were worshipping this God who they call Abba Father.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I would only go to church for Sunday schools to hear interesting Bible stories and enjoy yummy candies.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   As I stayed with the church longer I saw something different among the people who are called Christians.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   They were extremely kind and loving towards others, making me curious and wanting to know who this God is and what makes them this way.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   When I was still in Taiwan I feel ashamed when people ask me if I went to church.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I think about moving to the United States where Christianity is the main religion excited me.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Moving to the US as a freshman in high school I had so much love for this Christ who I did not know really well but was excited to know.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And I was also excited to be a part of a church family.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I attended my own church and was convinced that I was a Christian with my shallow knowledge of God and was baptized in December 2015.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Right now looking back I do not believe that I was saved.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   When people ask me I would tell them that I'm Christian but in real life I only attended church occasionally and lived life for myself like the rest of the world.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I did not know who this God really is and did not have a personal relationship with him.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   All I knew about the gospel was only half true that God loves me and that's all.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And I continued to go after the world and put my hope in all temporary worldly desires.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   In December 2018 during my senior year of high school I went into a three month period of depression without telling anyone.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I lost hope, cried to sleep every day and did not know how to ask for help.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   One night while I was crying to sleep and at the lowest point thinking about death I hear the voice from above God say to me Jen I love you.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It was a heartwarming and touching experience.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That was my first time hearing the voice of God and I prayed to God and surrendered my life to him for help right after.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Immediately God opened my heart the next day and I finally shared my thoughts and what I was going through with one of my close friends who also happened to be a Christian.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   She encouraged me and prayed for me.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   This made me hungry and thirst to learn more about Christianity and the love of God.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Coming into UCI I was hoping to find a Christian community where I could grow spiritually and learn more about this God.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   By the grace of God I was introduced to Berean Community Church during my second quarter at UCI.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I saw a group of genuine believers who lived their lives glorifying to God.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I was encouraged and rebuked at the same time after learning more about the biblical truth and getting to know this godly individuals
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and seeing how humble they are recognizing their own weaknesses and sin and repent.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   For the very first time I learned the complete version of the gospel.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   In Romans 5, 8 but God demonstrated his own love towards us.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   In that while we were yet sinners God Christ died for us.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   This was also the first time I learned about the importance of devotion and prayer and had started to take these steps for my spiritual growth.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Going into quarantine was a challenge to my still growing faith.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   I was hopeless about the uncertainty and feel this content not being able to see people in person.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Through the bible study on the book of Philippians and first Corinthians I learned that the Lord is the only source of joy, hope and peace.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And everything else in this world is just material and will one day fade away.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Through the Holy Spirit my eyes were opened and led me to genuine surrender and repentance.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Ever since then my joy and contentment are only found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And I'm able to recognize the godly wisdom versus the worthy wisdom.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Throughout my life there are so many ups and downs but I know that these are all God's grace.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I'm super thankful that God prunes me and reveals my sinfulness and pride through them all
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   to make me come to an understanding of what my life is truly about.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   He always closes doors and opens even better ones for me.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   I once was lost but now I'm found.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I once was a slave to sin but it was only through the blood of Christ my sins are forgiven and an eternal life was given.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I will still sin in the future but I will not destined grow to be a hobbit.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Instead I will strive to kill sin and pursue a life of holiness.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It is no longer who I live but Christ who lives in me.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I want to know God more and make him known.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Thank you.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   [applause]
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   [inaudible]
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   [applause]
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Alright, thank you Jennifer for your testimony.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 35.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And we're going to be reading all the way to verse 40.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse 35 all the way to verse 40.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   [pause]
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It says, "Women received back their dead by resurrection and others were tortured not accepting their release
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   so that they might obtain a better resurrection.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And others experienced mockings and scourging, yes also chains and imprisonment.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   they were put to death with the sword.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   They went about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Men of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And all these having gained approval through their faith did not receive what was promised
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   because God had provided something better for us so that apart from us they would not be made perfect."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Let's pray.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Grace Father we pray that your word would speak to us,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   allow our hearts Lord God to be molded according to your purpose and will.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Lord search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   That all that we have we would surrender.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And that our hearts Lord God and our mind, our will, will all be molded according to your purpose.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   You know, when I first became a Christian,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I think most people in my generation was trained how to evangelize through the four spiritual laws.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Some of you guys may know what they are.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   It was created by a man Bill Bright from CCC.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And I actually had an opportunity to meet him years ago at a conference.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And so there was a small number of us, maybe about a 30 of us,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   were able to sit in a room and just pick his brain and it very Godly man.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And I didn't realize that CCC, Campus Crusade for Christ, was actually started at UCLA in 1951.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And so we were able to pick his brain and ask him questions.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And he was really into praying and fasting at that time.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   So we were very challenged.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Some of you guys who are maybe a little bit older may have been trained in the same way.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   This four spiritual law basically begins by saying God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And then the second part is, but all have sinned and fall short of God's glory.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And we've been separated from this.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And third, Christ came and died for us to bridge that gap in order that we may have life again.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And then fourth, God requires all men and women to repent and receive this forgiveness.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And so those are the four spiritual laws.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And again, you know, paraphrased, but in a nutshell, those are the meaning.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Again, for many years, I would say for seven, eight years of early life as a Christian,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I would go through the four spiritual laws because that's how I was trained.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And I realized after time passing that the first part of that can easily be misunderstood.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And I don't think that was the intention of Bill Bright.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   That his intention was to present the full gospel.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But that first part where it says God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I started to see how some people were twisting that to think that God's ultimate plan for us is for us to prosper.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   He wants us to be healthy.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   He wants us to be wealthy.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And so, again, I met the man, and I know that that was not his intention,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   but I started to see how some people can easily twist how the gospel is presented and say,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   "Well, God wants me to be happy."
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   God wants it. There's nothing I can do.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And God wants me to be happy.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   The gospel is a way for me to achieve happiness, and I can't do that unless I repent and I receive Christ.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Now, the problem with that type of thinking, one, is completely unbiblical.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Because the Bible does not teach that.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   In fact, the Bible completely contradicts that.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   The text that we're looking at, up to verse 35, he's been given examples of men and women of faith,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   how sometimes, even in their great suffering and sacrifice,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   God used that to lift them up and to glorify and to save Israel and to do many great things for God.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   But then we get to the second part of chapter 30, verse 35,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   and he just simply says, you know, "Women received back their dead by the resurrection, and others,"
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   you know, no big hoopla, he doesn't even say "but," he just says,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   "and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection."
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And then he goes down a list of all these things that these people experienced,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and they never experienced this abundant life.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   They were tortured, they lived homeless, they were mocked, they starved,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   and some of them just died that way.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   So it doesn't fit this narrative that God's ultimate purpose is so that we can have a wonderful life,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   not in the way that many people experience or think that they are.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   You've probably heard of the health and wealth gospel preachers.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Joel Osteen, probably in our generation, is on the top of that list.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And I don't know for whatever the reason that some churches are afraid to call false teachers out,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   because that's part of our job, right?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   It's part of our job to recognize that when false teaching and false teachers
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   begin to propagate things that are unbiblical, it's not just difference of opinion.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   They are actually going against what the Bible teaches.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And it prevents certain people from coming to Christ.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Joel Osteen, on the top of that list, wrote a book called "Best Life Now," and this is what he says.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   "God didn't make you to be average. God created you to excel.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Therefore, if you will start acting like it, talking like it, seeing yourself as more than a conqueror,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   you will live a prosperous and victorious life."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Obviously, what he means by prosperous is being very wealthy.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Benny Hinn is another man who is very well-known and had decades of ministry teaching the same false gospel.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   And this is what he is quoting and saying.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   "God will begin to prosper you, for money always follows righteousness."
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Clearly, he never read the Bible. Clearly, he never read the Bible.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Jesus says, when people were coming to Him, "I want to follow you," He said, "birds of the fox have holes,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head."
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   In other words, I'm homeless. If you follow me, you're also going to be homeless.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   So He warned them to make sure that you know what you're getting into.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   All the disciples, they didn't live a better life, they didn't get a better job.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Most of them, with the exception of one, were martyred because they believed in Jesus Christ.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   We have countless number of people, because of their faith, have ruined their lives.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Apostle Paul, a perfect example of one, who has pretty much achieved what every Jew would have wanted
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   in education and in wealth and position, and even religiously, and yet he ruined all of that because he met Christ.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I remember years ago, there was a man named Fred Price.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Most of you guys who are younger will probably not remember him, but he was a famous preacher in LA.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   His church bought the Coliseum, some of you guys who remember the Coliseum, and it could fit probably about 50,000 to 60,000 people.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   It was one of the largest churches in this area, probably in the United States.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Excellent preacher. Not knowing who he was, early Sunday morning, before I went to church, I wanted to hear a sermon, and I had him on.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   One of the sermons he had, people stand up. He said, "Anybody who's on welfare, stand up."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   So he had a bunch of people, not knowing what he was doing, just starting to stand up.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   "Anybody who's not getting minimum wage, stand up. Anybody who doesn't get paid this much, stand up."
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Then after they stood up, he began to rebuke them.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   This is on national television. He said, "The reason why you're on welfare is because you don't have enough faith.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   The reason why you don't have a house is because you don't have enough faith.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   The reason why you don't drive a certain type of car is because you lack faith."
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Then he began to expound upon his wealth.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   How he has so many Rolls Royces, and how he has so many houses, what kind of clothes he wears, and how much his shoes cost.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   All of that on national television, and you can see the demeanor of these people who stood up, just kind of shriveling in shame.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   I remember watching that, being so disgusted that this man was publicly shaming these people simply because they weren't making money.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Sad to say, even though we may be disgusted by what he says, this health and wealth gospel has so deeply been embedded into our psyche.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   We practice it without even recognizing that that's what we're doing.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Even in biblical Bible teaching churches, even like ours.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   I remember years ago at a conference, John Piper came to speak, and he was the keynote speaker.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   He got up on the pulpit and he said, "You know, I had this message prepared, but I really felt convicted to preach a completely different sermon."
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Then he began to preach about suffering as a Christian.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   The whole sermon was based upon how God ordained suffering for the sake of His glory.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   It was a great message. I always wondered why he decided to change the message.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   I found out later on what the reason was, which I'm not going to get into this morning.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   I remember at that conference, there were about 27 Russian pastors who used to pastor in the old communist regime.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   They were coming in and out of prison, so they invited them to come pay for their airfare, got them to stay.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   They happened to be in the room when he was preaching that.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   After John Piper finished, they asked the leader of that group to come up and give his testimony.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   I remember that Russian pastor stood up, and the first thing that he said was,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   "I want to thank John Piper for preaching that sermon, because I never thought that I would hear a sermon in America to American pastors about suffering."
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   It was, in one sense, thanking him for the sermon, but at the same time, backslapping everybody else.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   He said, "We never thought that this would ever be taught in an American church."
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   The author of the letter, remember why he's writing this letter.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   He's writing this letter because the persecution in the church wouldn't let up.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Remember, in the beginning, they were rejoicing in their property being confiscated.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   When their friends were being arrested, they went and visited them, and they were rejoicing.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   "We're suffering for Christ," and they were willing to put up with that for a short period, but it wouldn't let up.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Ten years passed, 20 years passed, 30 years passed.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   By the time this letter is written, they're in their second, possibly even third generation Christians,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   and they're beginning to drift back into their old line.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Backsliding usually doesn't happen overnight.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   You don't wake up one morning and say, "You know what? It's too hard following Christ, so I'm just going to go and make money."
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   You don't do that. Usually, backsliding happens because you compromise.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   God calls you to do something, and you say, "What if I do this?"
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   God didn't call everybody. "What if I do this?"
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   You start to make small compromises, and you begin to see your heart starting to harden up.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   In your mind, you've never abandoned your faith.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   You've just made a series of compromises that cause you to drift further and further away from God.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Physically, you're still at church. You're still at Bible study.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   But you know deep in your heart, you have a limit to how far you will go in following Christ.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   So the Christianity that we've created is a Christianity that doesn't look like the Scripture.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   The Christianity that we've created is a breaking of the second commandment of the Ten Commandments,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   where he says, "Thou shalt not worship any other god," and the second commandment is,
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   "Thou shalt not make any grave images of me and worship me."
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   In other words, don't make up a god that is more palatable to you and worship that, and say, "You're worshiping me."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Backsliding typically happens gradually because we avoid suffering at every end.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   "If I do this, I might lose my job. If I do this, my friends are going to be happy.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   If I do this, I might not be able to get this. If I do this, I might not be able to get that house."
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   And so after a series of compromises, we have created a Jesus that doesn't look anything like the Scripture.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   So he's writing this letter to challenge them that Christ is better than anything that you are backsliding into.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   That Christ is better than that. Do you recognize who Jesus is?
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   He's better than the angel. He's better than Moses. He's better than the sacrifices.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   He's better than the priests. He's better than the temple. He has a better covenant.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   So the whole thing that we've been talking about in the whole book of Hebrews is, "He is better."
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   So if that is the priest, if he's writing this letter to a group of people who are having a hard time with suffering,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   you would think that he would leave this out because this would be completely discouraging.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   Right?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Leave it at the first 35.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Women receive back their dead by resurrection.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   All these great things happen because they believe God.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   But then he says, "But others, they're tortured."
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Some of them died, experienced mocking, scourging, chains, imprisonment, sawn in two, tempted, experienced death,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   sheepskins, goatskin, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated, wandering deserts, mountains and caves and holes in the ground.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   And it doesn't end with, "They did all of that, but God lifted them up, and so therefore they experienced greatness and then they died."
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   No, they just died.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I mean, if your goal is to write this letter to encourage people who are suffering to continue and persevere,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   you would think that he would say, "Relief is coming."
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   For a short time you're experiencing this, but after that you're going to experience glory.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Just put in a year, put in two years.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   And if you continue, good things are coming.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   He doesn't say that.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Some experience this, some experience this.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   The heroes of the faith that he talks about, some experience their children being resurrected,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   and some voluntarily give their life.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And he says the reason why is because they wanted a better resurrection.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Because they believed that the payoff wasn't here.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   They were willing to even give their life, because they knew that the hope that they had wasn't here.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   It was after, and that's why they were able to persevere.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   You know, I was at a conference not that long ago, and when our church was struggling and we were small,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   we had like 30, 35 people for many years.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   We did a podcast describing our church in the beginning, because it wasn't a normal church plan.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   We just got thrown out, and we just tried to survive.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And I just had a kid, and another kid, and another kid, eventually another kid.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   We had many kids.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   And in the midst of what we were doing in ministry, we were just trying to survive.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And no one asked me about ministry advice back then.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   In fact, everybody was giving me ministry advice.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   They said, "Oh, you should go to that church. You should go to this conference.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Oh, if you talk to that pastor. Oh, if you were discipled by this pastor, maybe your church would do better."
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   But as soon as our church started growing to a certain number, you know, 300, 400,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   and then they said, "Oh, what are you doing over there?
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   How do you do your Bible study? What is your teaching like?"
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   And all of a sudden, they want to know.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   So I remember I was at a conference, and I was asked that question.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   And, you know, we had smart men.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   There's like three or four other churches that are larger in size,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   and so they asked us to give a presentation about our church, our ministry philosophy, what we're doing.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   And each one of them were going around, and smart guys, articulate, you know, talented, gifted.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   And I was blown away.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   You know, I felt like I don't belong here.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I don't even understand some of the words that they're using, you know.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And it came to my turn.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   "So, Peter, what happened at your church?"
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   And I told them the story that we told you in the podcast.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Like, I didn't want to be a pastor.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   I just felt bad for the kids, and I just held on for dear life.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Right? And that's how we got here.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And I remember, it's like, "Huh."
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   It was nothing useful that I said.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Other than I just didn't quit.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Right?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   And I remember after I said that, the pastor was presiding to kind of wrap things up, and he said,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   "Who knows? If you did what Peter did, maybe your church would be the next Berean."
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   And I remember I ended up by saying, "Or not."
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   It was awkward. It was very awkward.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Right? It was clear I didn't belong there.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Right?
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Because the point that I was trying to make was that it wasn't ingenuity.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It wasn't anything.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Because we're not doing anything different than we did the first seven years,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   and the next seven years that caused it to grow.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   But our natural tendency is to think that if we do certain things right, good things are going to come.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   And good things is like bigger church, better finances, better homes, healthier, wealthier, and long life.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   And then when that doesn't happen, we deconstruct.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   What did we do wrong?
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   What should we do better?
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   What's our plan?
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   And then we're constantly deconstructing and reconstructing because of what?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Because we have what we think God wants.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Better life, healthier life, longer life, better bank account, right?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Our children are safe, better taken care of, better education.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   And so we have the same standard that the world has, we just brought it into our Christian life.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   And we don't normally filter that out.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   We just kind of, you know, because it has that Christian name on it, we don't recognize that as the health and well.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   It's so deeply embedded in us.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   This passage completely obliterates those thoughts.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   It says that some were sawn in two.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Now it doesn't mention any names.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   None of this has any names because prior to that it was mentioning Abraham and Moses and Joseph and Jacob
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   and all these great men and women who by faith did these great things.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   But then he says, but the others who were tortured and killed and, you know,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   and they were imprisoned and chained, wandering in deserts, none of their names are mentioned.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   I think the reason why none of the names are mentioned is because there's too many.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Because we have a tendency, like when you read missionary books,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   you usually read a book about an individual who went and bore ridiculous fruit.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Whether it's in China or India, wherever it is, and then we put them on a pedestal and we read about them.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   I want to be like Hudson Taylor.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   I want to be like William Carey.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   I'm going to be the next Billy Graham.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   I'm going to be the next John something.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   And so we put them on pedestals.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   We know a lot about very few people.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Majority of the people that have gone before us, for every one person that's been highlighted,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   there's probably hundreds of thousands of people who just labored, couldn't pay their bills,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   just barely surviving, constantly tempted to quit, and just making it.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   And it is God using those people to continue to establish his kingdom.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   We didn't get here by the Billy Grahams of the world.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   We got here by the grace of God.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   There were some Billy Grahams.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   There were some William Careys.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   There were some Hudson Taylors.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   But majority of the people that is described in verse 35 to 38 are never mentioned.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   In fact, for every one Moses, you're going to see hundreds of other people that God used,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   that you never heard of, but they're in Scripture.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people that have walked out into desert and never bore fruit.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Church planters who suffered for years and just closed up.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Missionaries who've gone to places and never saw a single convert.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I don't know how many pastors that I know dedicated their lives and in retirement didn't have a single penny in their name.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   No house, no retirement, no car, nothing.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   And they were dependent on other people just to make the end part.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   I have missionary friends who've been out in the field for 20, 25 years, come back,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   and they say they feel like beggars because they have nothing in their name.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   I know countless number of missionaries who've lost their children in their faith.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   They've dedicated everything to follow Christ and went out to foreign land,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   and their children got caught up in something, and they walked away from their faith.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   For every one Moses' and William Careys' and Amy Carmichael's,
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   these people that we write about and put on pedestals, many of them experienced verse 35 to 38.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   He says some were sawn in two.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   We don't know. When you think of Isaiah, Isaiah is probably the most quoted Old Testament prophet in the New Testament.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Isaiah, according to Jewish tradition, was martyred for his faith.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   Manasseh, King Manasseh was one of the worst kings that Israel had,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   and he just got sick and tired of Israel, of Isaiah, constantly telling them,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   "You need to turn from your sins, or judgment is coming."
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   He got so sick and tired of him, according to Jewish tradition, he was sawn in two.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   The true prophets who were speaking and trying to turn Israel from their sins,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   they were the ones who were stoned.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   The false prophets kept on coming and saying, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   The reason why the false prophets were popular is because that's what everybody was looking for, peace.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   You know what peace, the modern day translation for peace is?
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Health, wealth, and safety.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   And that's what the false teachers were propagating, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Jeremiah, here's a man who lived a miserable life.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   He's known as the weeping prophet.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   He wrote a book called Lamentations, because the whole book is about lamenting.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   In verse 37b, it says, "They went about in sheepskins, goatskins, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   men whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, mountains, and caves, holes in the ground."
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Now, any prophet probably can recognize that maybe this is their life as well,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   but Jeremiah exemplifies this.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   I mean, he lived such a miserable life, because God was using him to warn the nation of Israel.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And everywhere he went to speak, they hated his guts.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   God had him do such weird things, just wandering in the desert and walking around, you know,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   in places where he's going to be harmed all his life, just weeping.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   Not simply because of what was happening to him externally, but internally,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   he was saddened by what was coming, pleading with Israel to turn, and they would not turn.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   You know, when I think about my life, there are four periods that, you know, like watershed moments
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   that I can pinpoint and say that completely changed my life.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   First is coming to America, obviously, and I didn't choose that, right?
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   That happened to me, because my parents chose to come to the United States,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   and that's the reason why I don't speak Korean here, I'm speaking English, right?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   The culture where we grew up, all that changed because my parents decided to come to the United States.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   So that was a watershed moment for me at that time.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   Secondly, which is probably the most important out of all of them, was when I became a Christian.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   1983, December 26, 1130 p.m.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   I remember very distinctly when it happened.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   And it was almost like being there for your birth, right?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   Physical birth, that would be gross, but that's what it felt like.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   And spiritually, I knew when it happened, like, my life would never be the same.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   So that happened. So that was the second, and that changed everything for me.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   The third thing that happened was when I decided to go into ministry, full-time ministry.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   The reason why that was a watershed moment, it wasn't because I was choosing between,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   "Am I going to serve God or not serve God?"
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   I don't know how any Christian chooses, "I'm not going to serve God," right?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   "I'm a Christian, but I'm just going to do whatever I want," right?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   You're not a Christian.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   How can somebody who believes what we confess to be,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   whether you are an attorney or a business or whatever it is that you're doing,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   live your life saying, "You know what? I'm just going to live my life,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   and some people are going to go to hell, some people are going to go to heaven.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   I'm just going to live my life." That makes no sense to me.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   So it wasn't a decision between, "Am I going to serve God or not serve God?"
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   But specifically, I'm going to full-time ministry.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   And the reason why that was a difficult decision is because I'm a third-generation pastor.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   I saw the misery that my parents went through.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   And children who are in that family.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   And then my dad came from a pastor's family,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   and the misery that he experienced as a result of that.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   I remember during the war, the Korean War, because my grandfather was a pastor,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   he had to hide because the communists were coming, so he was basically gone.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   And my dad had to take care of his family when he was 16 years old, selling medicine,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   because his dad was a pastor.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   And when I was wrestling with this idea, I don't want to--
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I'll do anything. I'll be a businessman. I'll go to missions. I'll do anything.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Anything but a pastor. I don't want to do what my dad did.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   And then I had to surrender. I said, "Okay."
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   What else am I going to-- I want to preach the gospel,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   but if I make a lot of money, I'm concerned that I'm going to be tempted,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   so I'm going to go down this path.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   But the fourth and final thing--
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   I don't know what else is coming ahead, but the fourth and final thing was
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   in the context of this church.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   After five, six, seven years of struggling in the church
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   and not wanting to-- I was literally just dragging my feet,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   and the only reason why I did what I did is because I felt like the kids that were there--
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   they're not kids anymore, obviously, but kids weren't going to make it.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   So out of guilt. It wasn't out of great faith or this vision.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   What was your vision? I had no vision.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   I'm just being honest. I had no vision for this church.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   It was out of guilt.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   I can't leave them because if I leave them, I'm going to abandon my kids.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   They were like kids to me. My own kids.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   But I remember wrestling with this idea.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   I came into ministry thinking, "Okay, I'm going to do great things for God.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   I'm going to preach the gospel. I'm going to plant churches.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   I'm going to go out to missions. And even if I die early, that's a good way to live and die."
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   And I remember thinking, reading about Jim Elliot,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   how he prayed that he doesn't have a long life but a meaningful life,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   even if it's short, and that's exactly how he went out.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   And I remember thinking that. It's like, "Yeah, that's what I want to do."
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   I want to do hard things for God, and if I die early, that's a good way to live your life.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   But then the last part of it, I had to wrestle with,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   "What if God called you to be Jeremiah?"
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   Because Jeremiah just lived a long life, just miserable,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   preaching to people who didn't want to hear.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Never saw revival. Never really saw fruit.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Everybody that he cared about, that he was preaching to, hated him.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   I mean, he's the weeping prophet.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   And I remember really wrestling with that.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   And as I was digging through Scripture, and I was like,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   "Wow, there's more Jeremias in the Bible than there are Pauls."
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   Who am I to come before God and say, "I'm going to hear my Lord, send me there."
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   And then God said, "Well, go to the Israelites who are stiff-necked,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   and they're not going to listen to you. How long until you die?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Because they're not going to turn. Will you still go?"
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   And I couldn't answer that question.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   I'll go to China, North Korea.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   And I remember during that period, I wanted to do the craziest things
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   because there was some sense of glory in that.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   So I used to do a lot of public preaching.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Go out on the streets, and I would see the end of the parade,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   and I would be the last person at the parade, and I would preach the gospel.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   And I remember this one thing. In Cal State LA, they were having the anti-war rally
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   because of the first war in the Gulf.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   And there were hundreds of people over there who probably didn't want to go to class.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   And they were out there as anti-war chants, and they had a mic set up.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   And we just happened to be witnessing there in LA, and I thought, "Maybe this is a good place."
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   So I just kind of took about 40 minutes to gear up enough courage.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   And at the end, when we were about to leave, I said, "Give me a minute."
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   I said, "Oh, shoot. What's he going to do?"
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   So I stood up, and I got the mic, and I started preaching.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   And they didn't know what I was preaching, obviously, until I said the name Jesus.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   And if you ever want to know what it feels like to have 300 people flip them off all at once,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   I'll explain it to you what that felt like.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   And it was not fun, but afterwards, there was a sense of glory in that,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   like, "Oh, I did something hard for Jesus."
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   I did something hard for Jesus.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   I was willing to do all of that,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   even if it meant living in poverty, even if it meant having homeless people in my house.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   I was willing to do all of that.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   But I did not want to live the life that my dad lived,
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   struggling in a small church, taking care, having a hard time paying his bills,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   always worried about what the church people are going to think if he did this,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   and if he bought this car, what are they going to think, that we spent too much money on this,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   we can't buy this house, we can't take a vacation because we can't do this.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   I don't want to do that.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   But what if God called you to do that?
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   And I couldn't say yes.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   I said yes to everything else,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   even homeless ministry.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   My wife experienced having homeless people in my house.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   I said yes to that.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   But I couldn't say yes to pastoring a church.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   Because I didn't want to repeat what I saw.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   But the question that was brought to me was clear.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   Are you going to come before God and say,
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   "Here, my Lord, send me over here to these people at this time so I can do this,"
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   or are you just going to say, "Here, my Lord, send me,"
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   even if it's to this?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   Man, that broke me.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   More than the initial time when I decided to go into ministry.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   More than when I became a Christian, because when I became a Christian, it was just good.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   God loves me?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   God created the universe, loves me, and He died for me?
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   It was all good.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   Nothing that I had, nothing that I sacrificed at that time seemed worth holding on to.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   But the fourth watershed in my life was what really broke me.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   And I realized that even in the way that I wanted to do ministry,
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   I had my own plans.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   I had my own desires.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   I had my own glory in mind.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   What if God calls you to serve people who don't want to be served all your life?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   Will you still say yes?
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   Apostle Paul, when he was called, here's a guy who had everything, money, already famed,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   religiously on the top of the ladder, meets Christ and his life is ruined.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Literally, his life is ruined.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   When he meets Christ, Jesus says from the get-go,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   "I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   He didn't say he's going to glorify me and all that stuff.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   He said, "No, I'm going to show him how much he must suffer for my name."
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   When he's writing 2 Corinthians, he's writing to a group of people who are questioning his apostleship.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Because he was not the greatest speaker.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Apollos was the great speaker. Peter was the great leader.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   Paul was the latecomer.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   And they were questioning him because they didn't like what he was saying,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   so they were kind of disqualifying him, saying he's not a true apostle.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   But Apostle Paul, in defense, and he is defending himself because people are questioning him.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   I think naturally he just was not the best speaker.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   In fact, the book of Acts says that he was in the habit of preaching so long, people actually died.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   That's what it said.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   He was in the habit of preaching on and on, and somebody fell off and died, and so he had to resurrect that guy.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   That's how bad of a preacher he was.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   He didn't know when to stop.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   But he, in defense, this is what he says in 2 Corinthians 11, 24.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   "Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Three times I was shipwrecked. A night and a day I spent in the deep.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   I have been on frequent journeys and dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from countrymen,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers in the sea, dangers among the false brethren.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   I have been in labor and hardship through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure."
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   And so his credential is not his upbringing.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   His credential is not the many churches that he planted.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   His credential wasn't his knowledge.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   His credential was his suffering.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   He said, "You question my apostasy, look at my suffering."
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   But along with that, verse 28, "Apart from such external things,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   there is a daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches."
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   I mean, it's hard enough, the external things, the stoning and the hardship and persecution and the whipping that he got.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   But he says on top of that, there's this internal pressure because he's concerned for the churches, for the people.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   As he's sitting in prison, he's concerned for the Philippians.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   As he's waiting to die in 2 Timothy, he's writing to his protege.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   Because he's concerned that even as he is facing death, he sees this internal pressure.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   Who is weak without my being weak?
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   This is a man who understood that he was called to suffer, just like Jesus said.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   He wasn't just called so that he can stand in a pulpit and hear the Savior, the Lord, and there's where Jesus is.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   It's like, no, he did that in the midst of much suffering.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   This flies in the face of all the people that I quoted in the beginning of the sermon.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   We hear so many times about how Christianity is flourishing all over the world.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   I've traveled enough and talked to enough people out in the field to know that the number of Christians have been so bloated.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   I remember talking to a pastor in an underground church in China, and I've heard numbers as big as 350 million Christians.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   And I asked him, "Is that true?" And he said, "Not even close."
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   He said, "Most of the numbers that you're hearing about are people who are coming to faith because of the health and wealth gospel."
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, all false teachers, because they promise that if you believe in Jesus, that you can have the wealth that these missionaries have.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   So they want to be like Americans, that if you believe Jesus, and Jesus is their ticket to get wealth,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   a lot of the people who are coming to faith are coming for that reason.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   It's not the true gospel, it's the health and wealth gospel that's spreading all over the world.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   Jesus clearly said that the path to life is narrow, and it is difficult, and few will be found in it.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   He says all of this and reminds us again in 1 Peter 4.12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you."
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   You shouldn't be surprised because Jesus told us, the Bible made it very plain to us.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   There are examples that are given to us in the scripture, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange things were happening to you.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   You notice how whenever hardship comes, we think, "What did we do wrong?"
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   If a church is planted and it doesn't bear fruit, it doesn't grow, what did we do wrong?
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   If people begin to leave because you're preaching the gospel, what did we do wrong?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   If we started having relational issues and sinners don't appreciate what you're doing, what did we do wrong?
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   We planted a church and we're trying to share the gospel and nobody's interested, and what did we do wrong?
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   We have a tendency to kind of deconstruct everything that we think isn't meeting our standard,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   and so we need to reconstruct constantly, deconstructing, reconstructing, deconstructing, reconstructing,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   in order to get what? What the world has taught us, what success is.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   When all He told us to do is to be faithful, do not turn from the word to the left or to the right.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   In season and out of season, whether they listen or don't listen, whether you bear fruit or don't bear fruit,
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   whether the church grows or doesn't grow, in season and out of season, I only give you one thing.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   Preach the word in season and out of season.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   Sometimes the children are resurrected, sometimes they are not.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   Sometimes you will experience well, sometimes you will not.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   Sometimes people will thank you and praise you, and sometimes you will not.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   God uses that all for His glory.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Would you still follow Christ?
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   If following Christ meant you can't get into the school that you want,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   if you have to forfeit your career, would you still follow Christ?
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   If you can't get the house that you want, would you still follow Christ?
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   If your children are not safe, and given the best that you want to give them, would you still follow Christ?
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Are there conditions upon following Christ?
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   You see, the problem with the health and wealth gospel is, we don't break the first commandment.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   The first commandment is thou shalt not worship any other god.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   But the second commandment is thou shalt not make grave an image of me and worship it.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   In other words, don't create an idol, and then attach my name on it, and then worship it, thinking that you're worshipping me.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   When we deconstruct everything, that doesn't get us to a better life.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   We've created a Jesus that's not in the scripture.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   If the only Christian faith that we have embraced always leads to a better, comfortable life,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   then that Jesus is not the Jesus of the Bible.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   See, verses 35 through 38 completely blows that out of the water.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   You know, the health and wealth gospel, people, verse Jeremiah 29, 11, is a verse that they love.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   It says, "For I know the plans that I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare, not for calamity, to give you a future and a hope."
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   The way that the health and wealth gospel people see this is, and sometimes we even use it to encourage other people,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   that though it's hard now, if you endure a little bit, better things are coming tomorrow.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   Like tomorrow.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   Put in your time and discipline and sacrifice now, then better things will come tomorrow.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   Now, is that anything different than the world?
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   I go to the gym, I wake up 5 in the morning, and I outwork everybody else.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   This is why I got a million dollars, because I put in the hard work early.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   And I suffered.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   And I did what other people are not willing to do, and that's why I was successful.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   And the health and wealth gospel people use this verse to basically perpetuate the same thing,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   same wisdom that the world is giving.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   Put in your time now, sacrifice now, discipline now, then when you're 30, when you're 40, you're going to be wealthy, healthy.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   When he says, "God has a wonderful plan for your life," clearly, the wonderful plan isn't health and wealth.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   The wonderful plan he's talking about is that though some died and experienced resurrection,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   the others voluntarily gave their life and were tortured for what purpose?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   For a better resurrection.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   The wonderful plan that the Bible talks about is an eternity when Christ comes.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   When Christ comes.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   And if we miss that, you didn't just miss a part of Christianity.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   If you miss that, you didn't miss, you know, you weren't a B+ student as a Christian, but you weren't A.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   If you miss that, you missed Christianity, period.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   The Christianity that we practice, the health and wealth gospel mentality, is no different than the Buddhists going to the temple.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   You ever go to, you know, the Asian countries, and the ancient ruins are all Buddhist temples?
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   You wonder why they went through so much trouble to build statues of Buddha and temples in just weird places up in mountains?
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   You know, this is a thousand Buddha mountain.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   This is a hundred feet Buddha mountain.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   This is mountain Buddha.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   This is river Buddha.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   I mean, I remember the first time visiting China, and we must have gone to about a hundred Buddha something.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   I said, "Why was this so important?" Because that was their avenue to get health and wealth.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   That was their way of getting a better life.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   If we're not careful, Christians can do the same thing by becoming a member in the church, by being faithful and serving and giving.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   That I'm going to trade in something because I'm expecting something bigger.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   And then when that doesn't happen, God's not real.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   You're right. That God is not real.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   The God that many of those people turn away from was never real because he never promised that.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   That is not the God of the Bible.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   The God of the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11, 39 to 40, "And all these having gained approval through their faith,"
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   not through their hard work, not through their sacrifice, but sacrifices came because of their faith,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   did not receive what was promised because God had provided something better for us so that apart from us, they would not be made perfect.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   2 Corinthians 4, 17, "For momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison."
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Do you believe that?
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   Even in our suffering, it is producing in us a glory that you cannot possibly imagine that can be fulfilled here.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   It's far beyond that when his glory comes.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   Why did some people experience this great deliverance and why did some people just die in their difficult state?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   The answer is simple.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   It may be difficult to understand, but the answer is simple because in Isaiah 42, verse 8, it says,
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   "I am the Lord, that is my name. I would not give my glory to another, nor my praise to given images."
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   God says over and over again, he says, "For my name's sake, for my glory," over and over again, "for my glory."
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   So the answer is simple.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   Why did Joseph go through that and then experience, why did he experience what he experienced?
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   He says, "For my glory."
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   Why did Isaiah live his life and then was sown in two?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   "For my glory."
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   Why was Moses lifted up and experienced all of that?
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   "For his glory."
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   Why did Jeremiah live in misery?
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   "For his glory."
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   His glory in our comfort, his glory in our suffering, his glory in long life, his glory in life cut short,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   his glory in living in peace, and it is for his glory that we live a life of turmoil.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   It is his glory when we are financially wealthy, and it is his glory when we are struggling financially.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   All things, good and bad, it says, ultimately for his glory.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   I know what a non-believer will say when I say this.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   That's checked up.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   He's playing with us.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   So he's toying with us and letting some people suffer, and some people do this and that, and he's a jerk.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   Some people will say that because they don't believe, because they do not see, because they only see this life.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   And if this life is all that matters, they're absolutely right, because it didn't pay off.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   Some people are suffering, and some people are doing fine.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   He's unfair, the end.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   But you have to understand, the Bible says that you and I have been created to be his image bearers.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   That's our whole purpose of why we exist, is so that we may reflect his glory.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   So salvation is for the purpose of restoring us so that we may live according to how he created us.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   Now, keep that in mind.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   Now, why is that beneficial to us?
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   Because we live when he is glorified.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   Let me say that again.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   We live, we experience the greatest life when he is magnified the most.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   Imagine if LeBron James, I know some of you guys are not a fan of LeBron James, Steph Curry, whoever you want to say.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   If LeBron James came on the court and he started to interview everybody, "How can I make all of you happy?"
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Just make a list, and then he started reading all of that.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   Okay, so I'm going to design my game to make everybody happy.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   First of all, that's impossible.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   Because 30,000 people are going to have different ideas, right?
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   Pass more, shoot more, sit down, sit up.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   Right?
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   And I remember the criticism of LeBron James, like, "Man, that guy, he doesn't, you know, he passes too much.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   He's not clutch.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   He should take the shot."
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   And when he takes the shot, he's like, "Dude, he doesn't pass.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   All he wants is his own glory."
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   There's nothing he can do to satisfy anybody, everybody to begin with.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   But the best way to make the most number of people happy is to play the best game that he's able to play.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   When he is glorified on the court, everybody, everybody experiences euphoria.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   It brings people together.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   We experience koinonia, high-fiving.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   And you talk about that for years.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   Remember?
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   Remember when you were there when he did this?
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   Remember when Kobe shot 81 points?
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   Right?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   Remember when he did that?
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   What did he do other than glorify himself?
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   So selfish.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   So egocentric.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   But why did we experience this life?
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   Because Kobe glorified himself.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Because you and I were created for worship.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   So when God is glorified, we experience the best life.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   So salvation is to restore us so that our eyes may be opened to see this glory.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   And for eternity, we're going to be seeing his glory in a greater and more magnificent way.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   So we're going to be experiencing this life.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   So this momentary suffering, this momentary, this blip of a life, this mist of a life,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   that whether you live comfortably, whether you live uncomfortably, whether you are rich or whether you are poor,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   all this is producing in us eternal glory that we may have in his presence.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   That's why sometimes some people are called and they live in North Korea.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   And some of us live in America.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   There's a kind of glory that God can receive only when rich people are giving.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   There's a kind of glory that God gets when we are suffering.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   There's a kind of glory that God gets when we live a long life living for Christ.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   And there's a type of glory that God gets when our life is cut short.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   Because when he is glorified, what happens? The world ceases.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   The world ceases.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   Because what God is interested in is an eternity.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   That more and more people may see his glory and come to him.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   So sometimes God will use our suffering for that purpose.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Let me read the final passage, and I know it's a little bit long.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   This is the verse that I know Elder James used to quote when he was younger all the time.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   And I don't know his suffering inside, but this was one of his favorite verses.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   Habakkuk is written during a period when Israel--it's kind of like Isaiah.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   He's preaching to people who don't want to hear it.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   He's wondering, "God, why are you allowing the unjust to punish the just?"
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   And at the end conclusion of his grumbling before God, he says this,
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   though the yield of the olive should fail and the fields produce no food,
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   yet I will exalt in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   In the end, it's not about the vines being plenty and revival and all that.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   In the end, it's do you believe this God?
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   Do you believe this God?
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   And for this part, as they're preparing, they're going to be showing a video with a worship song.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   And so what I would like you to do--I think the lyrics on this song kind of summarizes
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   what God is trying to say and what this passage is teaching us.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   And so if you can just follow along.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   The lyrics are here. Just follow along.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   And then afterwards, they'll lead us in our final closing praise.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   Okay.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   [music]
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   We pray for blessings.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   We pray for peace.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   Comfort for family.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   Protection while we sleep.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   We pray for healing.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   For prosperity.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   We pray for your mighty hand to ease our suffering.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   All the while you hear each spoken need.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   What if your healing comes through tears?
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near?
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   What if trials of this life are your mercies in disguise?
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   We pray for wisdom, your voice to hear.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   We cry in anger when we cannot feel you near.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   We doubt your goodness.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   We doubt your love.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   As if every promise from your word is not enough.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.000]   All the while you hear each desperate plea.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000]   Long that we'd have faith to believe.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   What if your healing comes through tears?
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near?
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   What if trials of this life are your mercies in disguise?
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   When friends betray us, when darkness seems to win,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   we know the pain reminds this heart that this is not,
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   this is not our home.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   It's not our home.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   What if your healing comes through tears?
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:43.000]   And what if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near?
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   What if my greatest disappointments or the aching of this life
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy?
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.000]   And what if trials of this life, the rain, the storms, the hardest nights,
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   are your mercies in disguise?
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:27.000]   [piano music]
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   Okay, we're gonna close our time with a praise song.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   Can you all please stand again?
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000]   We're gonna sing the hymn "A Mighty Fortress is Our God."
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   And this is an old hymn penned by Martin Luther in the 1500s.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   And it's a song that God's used to really serve the church and his people for 500 years now.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   And it's been said that many people, many Christians who were persecuted, in exile,
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   or on their way to death, this was the song that they were singing.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   So I just want to go through real quickly, let's do two verses.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   Verse one, it says, "A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   Our helper, he admits the flood of mortal ills prevailing.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   For still our ancient foe that seeth to work us woe.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   His craft and power are great and armed with cruel fate.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   On earth is not his equal."
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   Verse two, "Did we in our own strength confide our striving would be losing.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   We're not the right man on our side, the man of God's own choosing.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   Thus ask who that may be, Christ Jesus it is he.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   The Lord upholds his name from age to age the same, and he must win the battle."
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   And there's a part of the song that goes to the bridge.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   This is not the original lyrics by Martin Luther,
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   but a modern hymn writer wrote this.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   "A mighty fortress, a rock unfailing, the king of glory forever.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   For endless ages enthroned in praises, the king of glory forever, amen."
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   So this hymn, it's a paraphrase of Psalm 46.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   And as we sing the song, I hope that you pay attention to the lyrics,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   and it would provide much encouragement for us as well.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   [music]
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   A mighty fortress is our God, the boulder and the hail.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   Our helper he amates the flood of mortal hairs prevail.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   For still our ancient foe, with sin to work us woe,
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:01.000]   His craft and power are great, and God with good ordain.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:12.000]   On earth is not his end.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   Deadly and heartless, our striving will be raised.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   We're not the right men on our side, the men of God's own choosing.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   Ask who that may be, 'cause Jesus, it is he.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:46.000]   The Lord of hosts is name, from age to age the same.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   And he must reign above.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   And though this world with devil's fill should threaten to undo,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   We will not fear, for God has brought his children triumph through.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000]   In the face of darkness' strain, we tremble not for him.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000]   One little worshiping.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   A mighty fortress, a rock unfailing, the King of glory forever, amen.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   For endless ages, in throngs and places, the King of glory forever, amen.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   The Lord above all earthly powers, no thanks to them abide.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   The Spirit and the gifts arise through him who weighed the side.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   Kids and kindred go, peace for all life, all soul.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   The body they may kill, brought truth about instead.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   His kingdom is for all, forever and ever.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   A mighty fortress, a rock unfailing, the King of glory forever, amen.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   For endless ages, in throngs and places, the King of glory forever, amen.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:40.000]   A mighty fortress, a rock unfailing, the King of glory forever, amen.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:59.000]   For endless ages, in throngs and places, the King of glory forever, forever, amen.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:06.000]   Let's pray.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for continued guidance.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   I pray that the Holy Spirit would speak to us and guide us, Lord God, that our eyes may be opened,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:27.000]   that we would not live for temporary things, that we would live, Lord God, for those that are eternal.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]   I pray that your word that you've implanted in us would bear fruit.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]   I pray, Father God, that your word, as you promised, would go forth,
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000]   would not return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained it.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000]   So whether we eat or drink, help us, Lord God, this week to truly do it for your glory.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   God sent his Son, and called him Jesus.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:12.000]   He came to love, heal, and forgive, live and die.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:26.000]   To buy my heart and an empty grave, he's there to give his Savior live.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:36.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   Because I know he holds the future, and life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]   Amen.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000]   All right, again, if I can ask this side of the room to go this way, and then this side to go that way.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
