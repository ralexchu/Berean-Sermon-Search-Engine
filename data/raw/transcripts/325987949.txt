[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Okay, let's get started.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.120]   So here's the first question.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.320]   There's a lot, so let's try to, man, you know, you guys have a lot when it comes to dating,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   huh?
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   It's just so funny.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.520]   Sometimes it's like twisting your arms and pulling your teeth and then like dating and
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520]   go, pfft.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   So many.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.760]   All right.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.160]   How can I be a respectful sister or brother in hanging out with a friend of the opposite
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.320]   gender that is dating someone else?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.400]   Well, this question, I would say as much as possible.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.240]   I hung out with like, first of all, you got to define what hanging out is, right?
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.960]   Is hanging out like, I don't know, like if it's like hanging out in an apartment because
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640]   like you happen to be at your apartment and someone like you're with like your roommate
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.800]   and then someone of the opposite gender comes in to hang out with you guys but then your
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.760]   roommate leaves and then it's just you guys and you guys are hanging out.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   I would say in a place like that, you guys probably shouldn't like be hanging out together
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   in a room like that, you know?
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.640]   So you have to define what hanging out is.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.520]   Is it grabbing a meal?
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.760]   Is it, you know, getting boba?
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.760]   That kind of stuff.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.440]   Largely, and this is generally, please understand what I'm saying by generally, I wouldn't encourage
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040]   a one-on-one hangout with just a guy and a girl.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.120]   And the reason for that is not because like you shouldn't like be having relationships
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:42.440]   with a brother or sister but things just tend to happen and then secondly, you don't know,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   you can't, like I said before, you can't control the other person's heart.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520]   And so even if you're keeping it casual and things like that, you have no control over
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520]   that.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.000]   So generally, I would say not hanging out with opposite gender is wiser alone anyway.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.640]   I am a big proponent of like, you know, hanging out in groups and I get to know people through
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   groups in group settings.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   I'm a big proponent of that.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.040]   You get to know people well through there.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.520]   Actually sometimes I wonder if in the, like in the dating sense, like on that one-on-one
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.000]   thing, like you actually tend to very directly display what you want that other person, what
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.800]   you want that other person to see about yourself.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520]   Because you're like honed in on this one person.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.760]   But in group settings, you're going to like see them interact with this person and this
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300]   person, you'll get a better perspective of that.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.520]   So with that, I think that kind of answers the question in a direct way.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.400]   Okay, second one, what are some warning signs signaling you should break up?
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.320]   I remember those warnings that I put, like when there's like manipulation, obsession.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.360]   What was the last one I put?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   Abuse.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.840]   Manipulation, obsession, and abuse.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.320]   I think those are pretty good warning signs.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.480]   When you see it becoming unhealthy and it is damaging not only that relationship but
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.220]   like the relationship with God.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.560]   I think those are some warning signs for that.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.720]   If it's kind of gone out of control in terms of like the intimacy that's there, I would
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.320]   say there are certain places where it wouldn't merit like just ending it and taking.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.120]   A lot of people like think about like can we just take a break, you know, because you
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.060]   want to kind of hold on to the relationship.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.160]   I would encourage not taking breaks as much as possible too.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.880]   I would say just break up and then just pursue Christ, make it clean.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   Somewhere down the line, you know, like that's how we always think like, oh, like maybe somewhere
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.720]   down the line it can happen.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.880]   Don't even entertain that.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.120]   But somewhere down the line once you guys are both healthier, like it's possible that
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   like it can kind of happen again, right?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   But I see too many people trying to break up, take this long break and then get back
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.360]   together and things like that.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:08.840]   And it actually more often than not is uglier and healthier because of some additional things.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.520]   But that's not a rule.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.600]   That's just generally what I've seen.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.040]   I've seen them work too.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.720]   I've seen people work out and break up and get back together, break up and get back together.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   And so it's not that you shouldn't.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.800]   And really at a certain point like if it's the person you want to date, even if you guys
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.520]   have broken up in the future, maybe you could pursue again.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   In dating, are there topics you should not share or discuss?
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.080]   I mean there are obvious ones, right?
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.840]   If you're struggling with something like purity, you shouldn't be sharing that.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.160]   You can make it general though, but don't be specific as you would with like if you're
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   a guy to a brother or a girl to a sister.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   And also, I know this sounds weird, but beware praying, just the two of you.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.840]   And there is a reality of spiritual intimacy.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.640]   Like pray, go ahead and pray.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.800]   Spend time in prayer and go through material together.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.440]   But you guys don't want to grow like dependent on each other for your spiritual walk and
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.560]   you don't want to get to a place where like you guys are praying and at the end, you know,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   you start crying in your prayer and you guys feel like close to each other and you're like
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   spiritually married and stuff.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:40.000]   When you are dating, how should you go about friendships with the opposite gender?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.640]   Well, if you have, if you're doing friendship with the opposite gender well, when you're
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   dating, it doesn't actually change too much, I think.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:01.320]   But where it does change is like you give a little bit more like priority and attention
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.000]   to the person that you're dating.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.400]   It sounds silly, but like, you know, like it's kind of obvious.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.720]   I've counseled some couples where like one of them is like, "Oh, they spend more time
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.080]   with them and they don't pay attention to me at all."
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.400]   Part of it is like, "Well, you got to suck that up."
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760]   But also the other part is like you do have to like pay attention.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.080]   You do have to be a little bit more special than anyone else.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:33.960]   And so with the opposite gender, remember kind of what we talked about during the seminar,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.880]   treat them as a brother or sister.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.720]   Don't like be going out all the time with them like on one-on-one things.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.680]   I would strongly recommend against that and you should be good.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   Do we need any like follow-up clarifying questions here?
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   At any point as I'm giving these answers, if you need some clarity, just raise your
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   hand, okay?
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.320]   All right.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.440]   How do you go about dating someone who has a member at a different church?
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.040]   What's so funny?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   Is that funny?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.880]   Oh, because we have some guys who are dating...
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   I see.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   Okay.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.800]   Just serve the church and the other person should be serving their church with all of
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   their hearts.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   Don't let the dating relationship ruin or impair or impede your ability to fully be
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   there at your church.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   So do that.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.440]   Yeah, make time for each other.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.200]   And then at a certain point in time, you guys are going to have to make that...
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   That question is going to come up, you know?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.640]   Like, okay, well, if this gets serious and like we're really talking about marriage,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.280]   we got to start talking about like which church to go to.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.480]   The right answer is always Berean.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   It's not.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   That's not the right answer.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.600]   There are a lot of great churches out there.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.520]   I just don't want you guys to leave.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   All right.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.480]   Why is flirting bad?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.760]   The intention of flirting, right?
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.920]   When you think about what flirting is, like why do you flirt?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   You don't have to answer.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.480]   Just think about it.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.080]   Why does one flirt?
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.460]   There are a few reasons.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.280]   You might flirt because you like that person.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.040]   So flirting comes out in different ways like you might like crack jokes at them or like,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.880]   you know, like little boys, they always like tease the girl that they like.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   It's kind of like that.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.160]   College students aren't too different actually.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.120]   So like you might do that kind of stuff.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.480]   But you question like why because there's...
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.580]   You want attention.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.880]   You might do it because it garners a response from people and it makes you feel good or
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.060]   liked or whatever.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.880]   There's lots of reasons why you might flirt.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.960]   Generally flirting is, I would say, a type of manipulation.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   It's different than showing interest in someone.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   So I don't think all flirting is bad if you want to put it that way because you can show
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   interest in people.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.160]   But the type of flirting we're talking about here in this seminar is the one where you're
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   like trying to get at something that isn't even like there.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.620]   So does that kind of make sense?
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:45.680]   I might need some response to this from you guys if that didn't make sense.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.180]   Yeah, Kayla.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.080]   The type of flirting that we're talking about in this seminar.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.220]   If it's just showing interest and there's just, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.540]   But like even with that, like the type of flirting in this seminar, we're talking about
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   like people who are, do I want to like give actual examples?
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.540]   Who said that?
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.540]   Okay.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.540]   I don't know.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.540]   There's so many.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:20.540]   It's so funny when you guys do it.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.940]   Like there are people who get like a little bit touchy.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.940]   You don't know it.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940]   You don't realize it.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.260]   But it's like you will place a hand on the shoulder and it's not like this kind of thing.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.860]   It's just like this or, you know, there are people who will do like the -- I do it to
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.860]   everyone.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.060]   So I guess I'm flirting with all you guys.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.220]   Every once in a while, I'll like walk by and I'll like give little shoves, right?
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.100]   Because I'm like, oh, I'm here.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.380]   But like with flirting, there are times where you might like do some teasing.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:11:00.140]   It might be the way you -- like there are times where like maybe you like to be -- play
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.420]   the victim role and like you like it when everyone is teasing you.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.420]   I've seen that happen.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.620]   And then like everyone surrounding you and like teasing you, stop it, you know, that
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.620]   kind of stuff.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.620]   And that could be a thing.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.940]   Man, I can't think of like any good ones right now.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.100]   But you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.500]   And you can see why like you have to put a leash on that.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.660]   So if it's just, you know, if it's leaking all over the place, then that's not okay.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.580]   Let's just move along from this one.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.580]   Spiritual boundaries, praying together.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.580]   Did this come after?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.580]   That's okay.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   Well, is it bad that physical attraction is the first thing I notice?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.460]   No, it's not.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.420]   It's not bad.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.020]   Because that's always going to be the first thing.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.900]   Well, kind of.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.980]   Because that's the first impression you have of someone, right?
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.540]   It's like what they look like.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.340]   So like if you're attracted to someone, you can't be like, oh, I'm sinning, you know,
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.980]   because all I care about is their looks.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.260]   No, you know, like God made people to be attracted to people.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   You know, people have types and all this kind of stuff.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.660]   And it's not always bad.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.180]   Like many of you might have been thinking about that in like James, like with the sin
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.180]   of partiality and stuff.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.980]   And you got to be careful about how you apply that into every context.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.940]   Because like observing, judging, that's something that happens.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.260]   We all judge each other, don't we?
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.380]   You see someone and then you just kind of like you make quick judgment calls and it
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.980]   happens in a blink of an eye.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:43.700]   But from there, if that is all that there is, then obviously that's not okay.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.700]   That's not good.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.260]   You know, if it's just that.
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.660]   So what that means is like you're physically attracted to someone and then so I'm going
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.660]   to ask them out.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.580]   Oh, I think someone asked about like online dating and stuff too.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.340]   Like a lot of like these websites, what it is, it's like you'll see the pictures and
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:08.460]   you're like swiping whatever way you're supposed to swipe and then that's all it is.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.580]   It's like a physical thing.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.340]   People say otherwise, you know, I'll read the description and all that.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.020]   But many times that's actually how it works.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.620]   So let that move on and if you don't see that moving on, if you don't like see anything
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.500]   about their character or their godliness or how they serve and these things aren't like
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.060]   accompanying you, I'll just be like, yeah, just, you know, they're just an attractive
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.860]   person to you physically but that's about it.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.860]   Move on.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.860]   Don't linger there.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:45.700]   What are some of the dangers of dating people that go to other churches?
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.660]   It's not wrong to date people from other churches.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:55.660]   Like if you're trying to fish for like some potential difficulties, I wouldn't call them
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   exactly dangerous.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:03.380]   Maybe they could be dangerous if it goes to a certain point but obviously like you're
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.580]   not going to be able to see them in the context of church.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.140]   That's big.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:18.180]   Like I think that's a big part of like observation that we don't give enough credit to, you know.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.780]   Like how they serve, the fact that there are older sisters that can vouch for her, older
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.020]   brothers who can vouch for him.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.220]   Like you can't have that really if they're going to another church.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:36.260]   So it makes it more difficult but it's not wrong to date people from other churches.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.740]   Any follow-up questions to these?
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.740]   Yes.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.740]   Feel.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:57.700]   Oh, you're dating someone from another church.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.860]   Like before dating or while you're dating?
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.020]   Well like before you get to that question, I would ask them like why is it that you want
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.980]   to date that person, you know.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.660]   So like there's going to be answers, right?
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.740]   Like good and bad and like any time you ask that question to anybody.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.540]   So if it's very superficial, you know like some of the stuff that we talked about like
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.260]   pump the brakes and observe.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.300]   Like have you done that?
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.900]   Have you been able to really see if like past, you know, like back when I was in youth group,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.180]   you love the praise team, you know, whoever was like leading the guitar and things like
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.180]   that.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:42.260]   I don't know if it's so much like that anymore but like so like people like, "Oh, that person
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   is so good-looking" or "That person is so pretty" or that kind of stuff because of their
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.780]   voice and all that.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.060]   And like if that's all you have where you're like just seeing like a snapshot of someone
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   saying you want to date that person, then it's probably not enough to warrant just dating.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:09.660]   Especially in college because it's such a volatile stage in life.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.660]   But from then like if you guys have like groups of friends that kind of hang out together
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:22.420]   and you're hearing good things about the person and things like that, then maybe you can.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.420]   It's hard.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.820]   That's why it makes it more difficult.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.620]   If you happen to, I don't know, you're dating someone from cross life and so like if you
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.380]   happen to have a relationship with Patrick James, you could like, if you happen to cross
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.940]   him, you could like ask or whatever.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.940]   I don't know.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.940]   Is that weird?
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.940]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.940]   Is that satisfactory to you?
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.940]   Okay.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.220]   Dating, in the dating, okay.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.140]   So Pastor Ed in his winter retreat sermon alluded to girls playing hard to get.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.420]   You mentioned not playing games.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.300]   What does that mean and what does that look like?
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.300]   Well, there were certain things that Pastor Ed said at the retreat that I don't agree
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.820]   with.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.180]   This is kind of one of them.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.980]   And yeah, and that's okay.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.380]   It's okay to disagree on some of these things.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.260]   I just don't think this is the wisest thing, you know.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.260]   Like it's not a game.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:22.180]   If someone comes up to you and they say like, "Hey," like, and this is the girl, right?
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.180]   Yeah, this is the girl.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.180]   If a guy comes up to you and says, "Hey, do you want to grab a cup of coffee?
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.860]   I'd like to get to know you better or I'm interested in you," just make it clear.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.060]   Just make it clear.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.980]   If you're not interested, then just say you're not interested.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.980]   And don't let him down easy either.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   Make it clear.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.580]   If you say like, "Oh, I'm just not ready to date right now."
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.140]   But for real, your answer is, "I don't want to date you."
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.540]   Make that clear or else they're going to be like, "I'm just going to wait and wait and
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.220]   wait until they're ready to date and come again."
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.380]   And they're going to ask you two months later, you know.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.420]   And so be very clear about, I think, like if someone does that.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.180]   Now if someone is showing interest in you, they haven't DTR'd with you, but like you're
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:19.460]   seeing signs because that happens, then I would say, I would say you want to...
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:28.620]   You want to make it clear back to them in your interest level.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:34.420]   If you're not interested in them and they're showing signs of interest, then make it clear
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.820]   that you're not interested.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.740]   This is where it gets really sticky and this is where like now it's not Bible talking,
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.780]   it's just this is what I think.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.300]   So do you guys know what I mean by that?
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:53.580]   If there's a guy who's showing interest in you and you're not interested, then don't,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.580]   you know.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.860]   Sometimes you might like that because you like being liked and so you might play along
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.860]   with that.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860]   Don't do that, you know.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:07.220]   If someone's doing that, just maybe remove yourself from some of those kinds of situations.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.380]   If you see a guy who's like joining every ministry that you're joining, you're like,
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.940]   "What is going on?"
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.780]   Be aware of it and make sure that you don't give them hope.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.780]   That's important though, you know.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.780]   They're like, "Man, guys who like a girl will cling on to every little clue."
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:32.980]   So yeah, careful.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:38.380]   Any follow-ups?
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.020]   If there seems to be...oh, maybe I should read this first.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.420]   Hold on.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.820]   If there seems to be unspoken mutual interest, what is the next step if you both feel unready
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.820]   to date?
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.940]   Is it better to DTR or continue to get distracted?
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.340]   Are you answering your own question here?
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.280]   Okay, I'm just kidding.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.620]   This is actually a very good question.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.700]   If there seems to be unspoken mutual interest and you're not and you both feel unready to
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:15.580]   date, then I would just...some people think, "Oh, maybe we should DTR to clarify."
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.220]   I would just say, "Not really.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.220]   I don't think you need to DTR."
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:24.740]   Be like, "Hey, I like you, you like me, but we're not ready to date and we'll deal with
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.740]   it."
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:31.100]   Because when you do that, it actually starts to create more linkage and it gets harder
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.100]   sometimes.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.940]   And so what I would say is if you're a person and you like that person and maybe you've
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.900]   taken a couple of steps too far and said things that have revealed your heart to them and
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:51.700]   some reciprocity, whatever, they reciprocated in that and then you guys are playing this
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.540]   weird dance and then you recognize, you're like, "What am I doing?"
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:00.980]   And what you wanna do in that place is just take a step back.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.580]   Like if it's a bunch of texting that's going on, just slowly dial back on the texting and
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:11.420]   then take longer to text and then eventually let that kinda dissipate.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:16.820]   You don't need to open up a can of worms where it doesn't need to be opened.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.820]   Again, opinion, this is just my thoughts.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:25.700]   So yeah, there's no reason to do that.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:32.820]   I did that one time in college and then it just created a lot of unnecessary turmoil
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.820]   for me.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:39.980]   I personally, it was obvious that I liked this girl and that she liked me and I had
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:45.660]   not been wise about how I guarded our time and interaction with each other.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.420]   And then so I ended up...
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   My pastor gave me the green light.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   "Yeah, go out with her."
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   And I was like, "Ask her out."
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.920]   I didn't feel ready.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.820]   And so we sat down and I said, "We gotta clarify this."
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.380]   So we sat down and I said, "Hey, I'm interested in you.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.860]   I like you, but I'm not ready to date."
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.100]   And she said, "Well, I like you too."
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:12.380]   And what happened after that was it made it so hard because it cleared it up where it
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.220]   didn't need to be cleared up 'cause I wasn't ready to date.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.620]   And so that actually turned into this eight-month drawn-out thing.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.800]   It actually ended up sanctifying my heart, but at the end of it, I think there is wisdom
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   and just...
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.880]   There's nothing there.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.320]   Just start to be wiser about your interaction with them.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.520]   Any follow-ups?
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   Please expand on divorce and if it ever could be justified.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.640]   Yes, there are terms in the Bible where divorce can be justified.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.280]   God still hates it, but he justifies it in a place.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:53.160]   And that's when one of the spouse has committed adultery against the other.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.880]   And there are instances also of believing, unbelieving type of thing where you become
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.080]   a believer and then the unbelieving spouse doesn't want to be with you anymore.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   At a certain point, there's a justification that's kind of given out there.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:16.400]   Let's move on from that one though.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.560]   You mentioned warning signs like obsession, manipulation, and abuse.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.280]   How can someone be aware of some of these red flags?
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.400]   What are some specific ways that they might appear?
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   We can't do all of them.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.120]   We'll just take one, obsession.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.480]   You can just feel it.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.320]   I'm not a big fan of like, you know, trust your gut, but you can just feel it when sometimes
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:44.920]   they're like, they just want too much of your time.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.840]   Things are just kind of too over the top.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.160]   It's not wrong, but as you start questioning that, you start to realize like, oh, they're
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.800]   idolizing me.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:05.680]   And then obsession can come and like it can start to bleed over usually into manipulation.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.320]   When they start like, usually when people are manipulating you, they'll start in one
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.800]   way and then they'll like start to shift when they don't get the response that they want
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   from you.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.480]   So in the beginning, they want more of your attention and you're not giving it to them.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.320]   So they make you feel guilty.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.360]   And then like, and so because you feel guilty, you kind of give into that a little bit, but
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:31.560]   inevitably because the obsession is there, infatuation is there, they're going to want
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   more.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   They're going to want more of your time.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.200]   And then the guilty thing just stops working.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.880]   It just makes you tired and it's starting to like feel, this whole thing starts to feel
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   really difficult.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.880]   Then they grow angry, you know, and if that doesn't work, then they're going to get sad.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.840]   They're going to be like, okay, and then they want your sympathy.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.960]   So all of that is actually a type of manipulation and people don't, many times don't know that
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.520]   they're doing it.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.000]   But these are unhealthy signs.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.720]   These are warning signs.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.800]   And that doesn't mean, again, it doesn't mean it's like, we are break up now.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's a deal breaker, but it does mean that you have to be very careful and you got to
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   kind of walk through this.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:15.560]   And then if there's like a recurring pattern of things and you realize like, you guys talked
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.840]   about it and said that they're not going to do this anymore, but you see the same thing
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:25.160]   done in a different package, in a different way, then probably they just need space.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.680]   You need to break up with them.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   They need to grow in the relationship.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   They need to mature.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   And then, yeah, and then figure it out from there.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.680]   So.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   Okay, three minutes left.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   Some of these are good, but.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:26:16.640]   What does it look like to be content/enjoy the season of dating while still being in
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   love/seeking clarity/knowing that dating is still a waiting season?
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.760]   What does movement toward marriage look like in a dating relationship?
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   Let's just do the first one.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   What does it look like to be content and enjoy the season of, like while dating, right?
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.720]   So what does it look like to be content while dating, even though we understand that marriage
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   is the final destination?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   That's a good question.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.560]   That's why I like, I would say just get married as soon as you possibly can, because that's
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.560]   what you want.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.720]   That's what that's for.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.360]   And so that's why I would say just wait as long as possible, and as many things are kind
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.600]   of as stable as possible that you can do.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.200]   But while you're dating, to be content is the same thing as when you're single.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.680]   That's why we're talking about contentment before you're dating is so important, because
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.520]   you need to learn to see what it is to be content in Christ alone.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.920]   That's not just the word that we, that's not just a phrase we throw around.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.640]   God needs to be the treasure of your heart.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   He needs to be everything.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.240]   And if he's not, then what's going to happen in a dating relationship is that person will
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.840]   become that.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.240]   We make things into what God ought to be.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:36.560]   And so in a dating relationship, it's still the same struggle, like contentment in Christ,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   to love God.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:46.680]   And in the midst of that, that's why the movement and communication and clearly defining expectations
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.520]   is very important in a dating relationship, because then like that's going to help in
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.600]   that term, in the terms of contentment.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Last one.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.880]   What do you think about online dating?
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.720]   That's a good question.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:09.440]   I'm not like, I'm not hardline against it.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.840]   As a college student, I would say like, I would be pretty hardline no if you're a college
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.280]   student, because you have plenty of interaction in college without needing to go into that
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.960]   dangerous space.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:31.200]   But online dating, I have seen people who have started dating through online dating
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.360]   and then getting married through online dating and stuff, but I've seen more danger than
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.240]   the very few examples of it actually working out.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.680]   And so generally, the question I would like to ask for people who want to go into online
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.360]   dating is, what's going on at church?
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:59.480]   Why is it that, if I were to ask you, is there anybody that you would like to date at church?
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:05.280]   And then it's like, no, there's just no one suitable.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:13.720]   You have to really challenge that and really think of what does that actually mean.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.880]   And start to learn what it is to trust God in the middle of things while not lowering
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.640]   your expectations of what a girl or a good guy ought to look like.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.600]   But this is where, this is why like, counsel is so important.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.840]   So with online dating, I say, first place is always like, in the Christian community.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.720]   I think that's where you should be trying to date and trying to find people to date.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.480]   But if it gets to a point where it's just really, really hard, it's not wrong to do
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   that.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   Okay.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.880]   Anyone have any like, dying to have their question asked or answered?
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.200]   I saw a pointing.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.600]   Do you want to?
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.080]   Okay, are we good?
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   Okay.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.440]   Why don't you take just a moment to pray for yourself that God would absorb these things
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   into your heart.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.320]   I'll give you guys about 30 seconds and I'll close this in prayer.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.520]   (fades out)
