[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Okay.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:15.520]   Anybody want to take a guess why I chose Beauty and the Beast?
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.680]   Because I like that movie?
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.060]   Maybe but no.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.560]   It is related to what we're studying.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.200]   Alright let's pray and we'll jump in, okay?
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.640]   Let's pray.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the opportunity to continue to study through Revelation.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.560]   We pray that you would give us open ears and hearts, help us to understand and glean what
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.720]   you desire for us and all its effects and all your desire, Father, for us to stay sober
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.480]   and that the end times would not catch us off guard like a thief coming at night.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.600]   Help us to live in such a way, Father God, that all of these things are things that we
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.180]   would eagerly anticipate and wait and to prepare for.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.680]   So we ask for your wisdom, we ask for your Holy Spirit's help.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.080]   Alright so the reasoning behind the Beauty and the Beast theme behind us is that in contrast
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.180]   to last week's study and the previous week's study, this week and next week's study is
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.380]   in reference, in contrast to the Beauty and the Beast, Beauty, not the Beauty, the Beast
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.120]   last week and the previous week, remember the Beast going after the woman and the seed,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120]   right?
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.360]   And so the last two weeks is kind of a set up for this conflict that we're going to see
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.700]   in chapter 16.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.520]   So what is in chapter 16?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   It's the bowl judgments, right?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   And out of the three separate judgments that we've seen, the seal judgments, and then what's
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.760]   the second judgment, set of judgments?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.400]   Trumpet judgments, and then the seal judgments.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   And which is the most intense out of the three?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   The bowl judgments.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.880]   So we've been seeing an increase of intensity of judgment for each one.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.360]   So the seal judgment starts, again, if you look at it, it's pretty intense too, but then
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.640]   it kind of steps it up in the trumpet judgments, and then we haven't even seen the seal judgments,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.480]   but all of this is in preparation for us to get to the seal judgments, which is in chapter
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   16.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Okay?
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   And then what happens after chapter 16 is the end result of this conflict, and then they
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   get into, again, that Satan is bound, there's a thousand year reign of Christ, and then
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   there's description of the new heaven and new earth, and then there's, again, a description
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.760]   of eternity at the very end in chapter, at the end of the book.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   Okay?
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   So chapter 14 and 15 is in reference to the Lamb of God, right, today's theme, and his
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.680]   preparation and his angels and the worship of heaven, but the previous two chapters where
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.040]   we're looking at the activity of the beast and the dragon, right?
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.840]   So that's where the theme is from, the beauty and the beast, in contrast, right?
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.480]   So today, we're going to be looking at what's going to lead up to chapter 16.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.680]   Remember we talked about that in the last chapter, what was it, what were we on, 14,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.560]   13, so starting from chapter 12 where we started the second session, all the way to chapter
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.960]   15, all of it is kind of like the background behind what's going to bring chapter 16.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.800]   Was it meant to be taken chronologically?
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.080]   Not necessarily, right?
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.300]   So it explains all the activity of Satan from the very beginning of its creation until the
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.240]   end times, right?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.420]   And the same thing here, if we look at chapter 14 and 15, it's the description of the activity
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.960]   of the Lamb of God all the way up to the end times, and then these things are going to
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   clash, and then when that clash happens, we see chapter 16, okay?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.480]   Bits and pieces of it.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.920]   So the beginning, the contrast between chapter, I put chapter 13 and 14, but really it's chapter
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.860]   12, 13 versus chapter 14 and 15.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.960]   So these two chapters are going to contrast with what was happening in the two chapters
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.240]   that we looked at prior to this week, okay?
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.720]   So if you remember, the end of chapter 13 ends with the mark of the beast, 666.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.340]   Either it's going to be on the forearm or the forehead, and all the world is going to
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.160]   receive this number.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.080]   And the consequence of this is that there's going to be economic consequences for those
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.320]   who do not get this number, right?
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.960]   So that's how chapter 13 ends.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.680]   And then chapter 14 begins with mark of the Father, right?
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.040]   So we see a one who is like the Son of Man, and then 144,000 who is in its presence, and
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   they're going to be having the mark of the Father and the Son on them.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.920]   So again, there's a clear contrast between what's happening in chapter 13 and what's
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.080]   happening in the beginning of chapter 14.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.040]   Again, in chapter 13 is a description of satanic work all throughout redemptive history, and
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.880]   that's what we've been studying in chapter 14.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.440]   So it wasn't just description of the end time.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.520]   Remember that three characters that are mentioned in chapter 13?
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   What's the first one?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:38.280]   The red dragon, and then the first beast, and then second beast.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040]   Yeah, after the first beast, there's second beast.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.120]   So who's the red dragon?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   Satan.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.340]   Who's the first beast?
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.080]   And who's the third, or second beast?
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.800]   What did we say?
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.640]   False prophets, right?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.720]   Most likely false prophets.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.160]   So each one serving the other.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.040]   So the prophets glorify the Antichrist, the Antichrist glorifies Satan, right?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.720]   And then remember, when we looked at it last week, what are these three things mimicking?
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   The Trinity.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.600]   God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.640]   And each one of them, if you look at their activity, the activity of the dragon, the
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.200]   activity of Antichrist, the activity of the false prophets.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.720]   Remember the prophets, remember some of the things that he says?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.440]   It gives breath, it glorifies the Antichrist, it deceives, it makes the Antichrist look
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.200]   like he's going to...
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.080]   What is something specific that happens to Antichrist that mimics Christ?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.760]   Right.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   It seems to have a fatal wound, and then he gets miraculously healed, and people are
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.640]   in awe, and then they end up worshiping the Antichrist, right?
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.120]   And then the Antichrist deceives the world, and then he gives glory to Satan.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.680]   So ultimately, it's to bring glory and worship to Satan, right?
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.920]   So we looked at that last week.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   So all of the activity of chapter 13 is mimicking the work of God the Father, the Son, and the
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   Holy Spirit, in order to bring attention and glory to Satan himself.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.240]   So chapter 14 begins by telling us that there's a, again, there's a greater force in the kingdom
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.040]   that is, again, is not going to allow that to happen.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   And that's where the conflict comes.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.000]   That's where the Christian persecution comes in.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   So chapter 14 is the introduction of the opposing forces of God that will do battle with Satan
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.840]   and the two beasts.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:52.200]   So that kind of gives you the outline, the setup for this chapter.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.920]   It begins with a vision of the Lamb of God being worshipped by the 144,000, right?
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   So where do we see the 144,000 before in Revelation?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   After what chapter?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.440]   Chapter 7, right?
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.680]   So after chapter 7, it doesn't describe in detail who the 144,000 are, other than that
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.640]   they are redeemed, and then it gives the number, the 12 different tribes, right?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   And so we, again, my opinion is it is in reference to the redeemed among the Israelites, right?
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.560]   That doesn't mean that there's exactly 144,000.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.320]   It just, it could be symbolic of a number, and it doesn't mean that the Jews are saved
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.640]   differently than the Christians.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   They're saved the same.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.760]   So they're in the kingdom, but they're distinct from the Gentiles, right?
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.160]   And remember why we said that?
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.600]   Because after the 144,000, remember, in the throne, who is behind them worshipping?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.240]   The nations, the Gentile world.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.960]   So the scripture distinguishes in chapter 7 between the 144,000 and the nations that
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   are coming.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:07.280]   So that's about all the description that we have of the 144,000, chapter 7, and then we
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.600]   get to chapter 14, and the description is a little bit more detailed, right?
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:20.360]   So the first scene is that the vision of John, it goes back and forth between the tribulation
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.200]   of intense judgment and interruption, and just kind of projecting worship of God in
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.660]   his throne, right?
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.280]   So if you remember, these are the passages that I've noted, Revelation chapter 1, 9 through
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   16.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   Do you remember that vision?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.640]   What is John seeing in Revelation chapter 1, before he gets into all the different things
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.280]   of the seven churches?
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.880]   What does he see?
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.920]   He sees the vision of Christ on his throne, right?
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.840]   That's how the book begins, description of Christ.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:59.500]   Chapter 4, after the visions, chapter 4 begins with the vision of God, and Him on His throne,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.420]   Him being worshipped, right?
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.260]   And then so chapter 5, 7, 11, it goes on where in between all these intense judgments, John
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.700]   all of a sudden, it almost seems like it's random, right?
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.340]   Because it doesn't seem connected, but all of a sudden, in the context of this intense
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.660]   judgment, John would be taken back, and then he would be shown this awesome vision of God
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.940]   on His throne, being worshipped.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.260]   And that would happen periodically.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.360]   And I mentioned this before, right?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.120]   So if you read it without really asking, "Why is this here?"
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.020]   You may just say, "Well, it's kind of random," right?
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.020]   Like, "Where does this fit?"
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.860]   So some of it seems to fit, some of it doesn't seem to fit, but it almost seems like God
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:47.140]   is trying to remind John that in the midst of all of this chaos, the heaven is not in
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.740]   chaos, right?
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.780]   There's a third of the world being wiped out, a fourth of mankind, the rivers are turning
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.500]   to blood, there's all kinds of plagues and famines and disasters and wars, and in the
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.020]   midst of all of this, he sees a vision of heaven, God is on His throne being worshipped,
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.020]   right?
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.100]   And it is in perfect peace, and everything is functioning exactly the way it should be
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   functioning.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.860]   There is no panic in the kingdom of God, right?
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.060]   Nobody's hurried, there's no anxiousness.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.380]   Same thing that you see in chapter 1, you will see in chapter 4, chapter 5, chapter
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.660]   7, chapter 14, and chapter 11.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:27.100]   And the same thing is, God is on His throne, and He is absolutely sovereign, and everything
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.660]   that is happening on earth has been ordained by God, right?
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.340]   God is completely in control.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.460]   So again, we've seen the intense activity, Satan is released, the Antichrist is coming,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.460]   right?
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.220]   The false prophets have come and is trying to deceive the world, and then the first thing
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.260]   that we see in the next scene is 144,000 worshipping the Lamb of God, right?
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:58.820]   And before we enter into the Armageddon, the big fight in chapter 16.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.480]   It describes in the beginning, it says that 144,000 are the only ones who are able to
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.060]   learn the new song, right?
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.820]   This elaborate song of worship is taking place, but it said they're the only ones who are
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:16.300]   able to learn this song, and to sing this song.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.500]   So we're not told why.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.260]   It just says that they're the only ones that are able to do this, right?
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.220]   Anybody have an opinion as to why?
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   Don't say it.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.780]   I just want you to ask yourselves, right?
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.540]   One of the key qualities of if you want to do, you want to be a good Bible student, you
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.100]   have to ask a lot of questions.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.940]   Don't just assume, right?
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.620]   So why are they not, why are other people not able to learn?
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.940]   We don't know because it doesn't spell it out for us, but it gives us a more detailed
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.800]   description of what is happening and who they are.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.780]   So the first thing that we are told in description of who they are, they are sexually pure.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.420]   They are called virgins.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.960]   What passage am I looking at?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.000]   Verse four, right?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.200]   It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.240]   So this is not to say that anyone who is married has defiled themselves, because that was contradicting
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.240]   scripture.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   That's not what the scripture says.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.800]   Most commentators believe that this is in reference symbolically of sexual purity.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.040]   They're not virgins because they aren't married and they're single people.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   They're pure because they didn't defile themselves with sexual immorality, and that's probably
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.280]   a better fit or better understanding of this, right?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.960]   So let me give you a few passages.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.720]   Did you put that down already?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   Okay.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.800]   Revelation 14, eight, right?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.040]   Another angel, a second followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.760]   who made all nations drink the wine of passion of her sexual immorality."
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.780]   So again, when the description of satanic kingdom, one of the top qualities of the satanic
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.840]   kingdom is sexual immorality.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   Oops.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.440]   Okay, first that's on your four, three.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.280]   Paul says, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   immorality."
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.720]   So you'll see on the list of sins that are listed, remember in the Bible, I've said it
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.520]   many times before, that it is never written randomly, that whatever is on the top one
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.640]   or two, it's there for a reason.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:42.280]   So whenever you see a list of sins describing a rebellious world, what is one of the top
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.480]   sins that's always mentioned, always almost on the top?
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.960]   It's sexual immorality, right?
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.200]   So sexual immorality is almost one of the top sins.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.920]   So in 2 Timothy 2, 22, it doesn't tell us to fight the sin, it says, "Flee from sexual
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.080]   immorality.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.520]   Flee youthful passions and pursue righteous faith, love, and peace, along with those who
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.600]   call on the Lord from a pure heart."
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:13.080]   So most commentators believe that what's happening here is that the 144,000 hasn't been tainted
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.520]   by the sin of the world.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   They've kept themselves pure.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.920]   I think I got another passage.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.460]   First Corinthians 6, 18, it says, "Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.200]   Every other sin a person commits outside the body, but the sexual immoral person sins against
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   his own body."
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.300]   So again, the sexual immorality is singled out above other sins, right?
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.960]   So not all sins are equal.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:38.040]   Sexual sin says, you know, all the sins, not that they're not sinful, not that God doesn't
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.000]   hate it, not that there isn't consequence for it, but it says among all the sins, the
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.600]   sexual immoral sin is actually even more harmful, right?
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.360]   So there's a warning to not participate in it, there's a warning to flee from it, because
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.200]   it could easily be the downfall of our faith.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.500]   And so the first description of the 144,000 is that they're sexually pure, okay?
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.700]   Secondly, it says they follow the Lamb wherever He goes, right?
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.340]   And this may be in reference to their obedience.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.140]   Remember, Jesus constantly said, "He who comes after me first must deny himself, pick up
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.700]   his cross, and follow me," right?
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.600]   To follow the Lamb wherever He goes isn't just because the Lamb, you know, happens to
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.320]   be, you know, He's going left, so we're going left.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.720]   This is a description of discipleship, of obedience, right?
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.200]   Wherever Jesus goes, He follows.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   So not only are they sexually pure, they're obedient, right?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.360]   And they mimic Christ.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.800]   Wherever He goes, they go.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:55.260]   It describes it as being the first fruits for God and the Lamb.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.900]   The idea of the first fruit has two significance.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   One, it signifies that they symbolically represent the whole of God's redeemed.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.220]   We talked about, we happened to talk about that this Sunday, right?
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:14.260]   If the first fruits are holy, the whole dough is holy, meaning that it was symbolic of everything
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.420]   else.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.880]   So the fact that they're called first fruits, meaning that they're symbolic of all of God's
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.600]   redeemed, right?
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   But secondly, it also signifies a dedication to be used for God's purpose.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.480]   So the initial, the 10%, the tithing, it signifies setting it apart.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.800]   So in the larger context, it means that it's symbolic of all of it being dedicated to God,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.280]   but that 10% specifically was to be used for God's purpose, right?
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.080]   It was used for temple, it was used for supporting the priest, for whatever God needed to do
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.120]   to support the temple worship and the priesthood and the Levites, it came from that 10%.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:59.020]   So to say that 144,000 were the first fruits of God and of the Son is one, they're symbolic
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.600]   of all the redeemed, and secondly, they have specific use for God in His kingdom.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.160]   And that's exactly what we're going to see, right?
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.080]   And then fourthly, it said, "They do not lie and they are blameless."
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.320]   Scripture clearly says it's what comes out of the person's mouth reveals what's in them,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.180]   right?
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.920]   In Luke chapter 645, "The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.880]   good, but the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.240]   of the heart, his mouth speaks."
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.960]   So, the fact that they're described as people who do not lie and are blameless, they're
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   saying that they are pure inside and out, right?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.080]   They not only have a reputation of being pure, but they're actually pure inside and out.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:58.960]   And again, Matthew 5-7, this is in the Beatitude where it says, "Blessed are the merciful,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.640]   for they shall receive mercy."
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.160]   I copied the wrong verse.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.720]   That's not what I wanted to copy.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.520]   Verse 8 is what I wanted to copy.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.360]   "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Okay.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.480]   "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.760]   So, the original question I asked was, how come other people were not able to learn this
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.480]   song, right?
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.200]   It doesn't describe for us why that was the case, but then when you see the description
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.560]   of the 144,000, how they were blameless, they did not lie, they didn't give in to the sexual
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.120]   immorality, right?
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.680]   They followed Jesus wherever he went.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.720]   They were the first fruits dedicated for God's use.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:52.520]   When you look at all of it, it really is describing one of the Beatitudes in Matthew 5-8.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.040]   Because they are pure in heart, they are able to see God, right?
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:05.360]   Again, in a lesser way, the Scripture clearly says that spiritual things are discerned spiritually,
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.800]   right?
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.120]   Discerning right and wrong in the Kingdom of God is directly linked to your spiritual
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.280]   condition.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.360]   God didn't make it so that you can approach God with your logic and intellect.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.840]   God made it so that we are able to discern what is from God, what is not from God, to
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   be able to see his glory is not from much study and intelligence, right?
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.000]   The Scripture spells out, so if you're not walking right with God, it's hard for us to
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.280]   even understand God's Word and his purpose.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   So this 144,000, again, it doesn't say that this is the reason why they were the only
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.520]   ones to see or able to understand, but because of their dedication and purity to God, one
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.440]   of the benefits of their obedience and purity was that they're able to see this, sing this
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:58.760]   new song and sing it where other people could not understand, okay?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:06.580]   The second portion of that in Revelation chapter 14 are the three angels and their work.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.480]   And I want you to notice as we are looking at these three angels, the progression.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.560]   All three of them have different messages.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.200]   There's something distinct going on, but you'll notice that all three, there's some kind of
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.480]   a link to all three of them.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.560]   There seems to be some kind of progression in their message and what they're doing, okay?
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:31.600]   The first angel is given the gospel to proclaim to those on earth, right?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.980]   What kind of gospel is it?
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:39.360]   How is the gospel described?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.720]   What's the word in front of the gospel?
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.880]   Eternal gospel, right?
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.800]   And again, this is one of those words that you can just kind of skim through and the
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.600]   gospel is described in many different ways, but here it's described as being eternal,
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.200]   that it is not just a gospel until we get to heaven, right?
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.040]   It is not just a good news for redemption until we're saved from hell and we're in heaven
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   for eternity.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.640]   He said this is going to be good news for eternity.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.200]   So I think one of the questions that I get asked every once in a while is if Adam and
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:21.840]   Eve was able to fall before they had sinful nature at the Garden of Eden, what's going
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.760]   to prevent us from falling in heaven?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.720]   You ever asked that before?
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.960]   Have somebody ever asked that before?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.000]   It's a legitimate question, right?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.320]   The distinction between the fall in the Garden of Eden and our eternal state is that the
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.140]   Holy Spirit makes an indwelling in us.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.280]   We are united with Christ for eternity.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.880]   So this gospel that saves us doesn't save us and put us back into the Garden of Eden.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.200]   It elevates us beyond the Garden of Eden, right?
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.800]   You understand that?
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.380]   So when he describes the gospel, he doesn't say this gospel saves us, but this gospel
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.620]   is eternal.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.460]   So our redemption is going to be permanent and eternal, right?
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.160]   Our union with Christ is not temporary until we get to heaven and then we get to start
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.040]   this all over again.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.720]   It's permanent and it's final.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.600]   So if you notice, he says that he went out to proclaim the gospel and then after he says
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:29.760]   that, right?
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   What verse are we in?
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.160]   Oh yeah, in verse 7, he went out to proclaim the eternal gospel, to proclaim to those who
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.240]   And he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory because the hour of his judgment
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.480]   has come and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water."
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.440]   Typically when we think about the gospel, we think about how God loves us and he redeems
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.220]   us and he saves us and all of that is true.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:01.080]   But the end goal of the gospel ultimately is to bring us back into a proper relationship
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.200]   with the Father, right?
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.560]   Because that's what was lost at the Garden of Eden.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.000]   We were made in the image of God and then when we sinned against God, that image was
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.860]   tainted.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.180]   So salvation ultimately is to bring us back to the Father.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:22.040]   So Christ's crucifixion on the cross, redeeming us, saving us, making us his children, these
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.120]   are all means to get us to the end.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:32.440]   The end isn't ultimately so that we don't go to hell or to get us to get to heaven.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:37.260]   Ultimately we're in heaven because we are restored back to the Father, right?
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.400]   So the way he describes, he goes out to proclaim the gospel and the first thing that comes
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.720]   out of his mouth is, "Fear God and give him the glory."
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:50.960]   So I don't know if any of you came from a Presbyterian background or you were part of
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.280]   KCM, you know, if some of you guys were, this is one of the things that are emphasized,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   the shorter catechism that they learn.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   And this is the first question of all the doctrines that they learn is, "What is the
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   chief end of man?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.600]   What is our ultimate purpose?"
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.880]   And the answer is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.600]   And that summarizes human history.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.480]   That summarizes redemptive history.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.760]   That God is restoring sinful men so that we would be restored back to glorifying God,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.320]   to live out our purpose, which is to glorify God.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.560]   And so the gospel that is being proclaimed by the first messenger is to restore that,
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   return our gospel.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.320]   So again, I want you to notice the progression.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:42.560]   The second angel, the second angel starting from verse 8, "So another angel, a second,
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.000]   followed, saying, 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.640]   the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.'"
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   Right?
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.240]   And that's basically the whole description in verse 8 of the second angel.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.320]   Right?
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.960]   So it's basically declaring the spiritual state of Babylon and how judgment is going
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.280]   to come because of that.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.360]   Babylon in the scripture is used to symbolize the fallen world that's in rebellion against
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   God.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:16.760]   So who is the god of this fallen world, Babylon?
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.200]   Second Corinthians 4.4, right?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.660]   God of this age has blinded the mind of the unbeliever.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:26.180]   So Satan has been given reign over Babylon.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.540]   So Babylon appears in Genesis chapter 11.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.900]   Remember the Tower of Babel?
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.120]   And that's where the word Babel comes from.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.660]   So in the Greek or in the Hebrew, when that word is used, sometimes it's called Babel,
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.240]   sometimes it's called Babylon.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.360]   And the word Babel basically means confusion.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.740]   Remember what happens in Genesis chapter 11, right?
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.180]   The sin increase, the wickedness increases in mankind and they gather together and they
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.700]   want to build this tower to become like God.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.700]   Right?
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.940]   And basically they want to challenge God.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:02.300]   And so God is stirred up in anger and He destroys the tower and then He separates them and brings
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   confusion.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   Right?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.020]   So, that's where we first hear the word Tower of Babel.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.900]   And then the second area is Babylonians.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.900]   Right?
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:19.740]   The Babylonians were known for not their cruelty, but their beauty and comfort.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.420]   So you guys remember when we were studying Isaiah, right?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.100]   And there's a description of Assyria's oppression against Israel.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.720]   You know how they use fear and how they're cruel and they're, you know, going after children.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.900]   And so God was using the nation of Assyria to bring judgment upon Israel.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.900]   Right?
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.480]   So remember how that was described?
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.140]   So how was the judgment of the Babylonians described?
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.940]   Do you remember?
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.940]   Is it too far back?
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.140]   Remember when we were going through Isaiah?
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.140]   The distinction between the Assyrians and the Babylonians?
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.920]   The Assyrians were bringing fear.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.980]   You worship us, you bow down to us.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.580]   The Babylonians were tempting them with goodness.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:13.760]   So the Babylonians, when they took Judah into captivity, the Babylonians actually gave them
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.640]   a lot of freedom.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.940]   They treated the Israelites well.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:24.000]   So remember when the Israelites were given permission by the Persians to send them back,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   very few of them returned because they enjoyed their life in Babylon.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   They settled in.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Right?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.200]   So Babylon, at least the city, was known for temptation, sexual immorality.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.680]   They had wealth, they had beauty.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.260]   So why would they want to leave all that behind and come back to Jerusalem?
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.040]   And so it was the lure of the world.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:50.500]   So when the Bible describes Babylon, it's describing a rebellious world that God judges,
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.320]   that is under control of Satan, and its primary temptation is not fear.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.000]   Its primary temptation is the lure.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.480]   And one of the top lure that we've already looked at is sexual immorality.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Right?
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.400]   Sexual freedom to do whatever you wanted.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.440]   Right?
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:13.000]   And so the second angel is bringing judgment and saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.960]   great, she who made nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality."
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.800]   So the progression that we see from the first angel to the second angel is the first angel
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.440]   goes out to proclaim the gospel.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   Right?
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.720]   Fear God and worship him.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   The second angel comes out and he's saying condemnation upon mankind.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.880]   So it almost seems like the first angel is rejected by the world.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.600]   And as a result, the second angel comes and he declares condemnation.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.840]   And then the third angel summarizes all of this.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   Right?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.920]   And he brings a clear message of judgment that's coming.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:58.400]   He says, "Those who have given allegiance to the beast will experience the wrath of
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.080]   God."
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.860]   This is not the discipline of God.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.960]   And that's the distinction between the wrath of God and the discipline of God.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.000]   Right?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.340]   Even as he is bringing the trumpet judgments, do you remember?
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.400]   Even as he is bringing the trumpet judgments, he is pleading with the world to repent.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.800]   Do you remember that?
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   It's not the final judgment.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.320]   And he doesn't wipe them all out.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.840]   He wipes a third out or a fourth out.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.240]   And even in the midst of all of this, God is opening his arms saying, "Even if now you
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   would repent."
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.440]   Do you remember?
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:36.960]   As we wrap up the trumpet judgments, he said that he's not going to delay, meaning the
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.980]   final judgment is going to come.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.800]   So the description that we have of the third angel is the final judgment.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.040]   Right?
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.400]   That the way he describes it, let me read it.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   Right?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   The third angel.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.840]   "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If anyone worships the
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.220]   beast and its image receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.680]   the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger.'"
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.840]   Right?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   So it's not just that.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.960]   I mean, just to think about the wrath of God is enough.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.980]   But he describes it saying this is going to be full strength.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.160]   This wine is going to be full strength.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.100]   It's not going to be diluted.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.680]   And he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.840]   presence of the lamb.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.920]   So again, the description of wine that's not diluted, meaning that God is not holding
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.720]   back any of his anger.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.460]   At the very end, when the judgment comes, it's not for the purpose of discipline, but
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.060]   for judgment.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.540]   Undiluted judgment.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.140]   Which up to this point, we haven't seen.
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:42.360]   As intense as judgment has been, all of it was in hopes that those who are remaining
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   would repent.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.300]   But when the final judgment comes, it will be the end.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.180]   And he will not hold back.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.180]   Right?
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.180]   Oh, sorry.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.140]   So the second part of it is it will not be diluted.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.760]   It will be purely for judgment.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:32:00.180]   It will be complete, final, and eternal forever.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:09.940]   So this third angel is describing the very end, the white throne judgment.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:17.620]   So this section ends with an exhortation to persevere even unto death.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   Verse 12.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.220]   "Here is a call for the endurance of the saints that those who keep the commandments of God
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:31.060]   and their faith in Jesus."
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.560]   Rest, right?
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   In verse 13.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.140]   "And I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Write this, blessed are the dead who die in the
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.920]   Lord from now on.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.760]   Blessed in these says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   follow them.'"
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.740]   So, again, the angel is describing a scene where Christians are going to be intensely
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.540]   persecuted and as a result of that, many of them are going to die.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.220]   And is reminding them that if you persevere, there's going to be great reward.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:04.820]   So in verse 13, he says, "From this point on, those who die are going to be blessed,
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.500]   because those who die are going to find true rest."
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.740]   So scripture often describes hell as a place of no rest.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.820]   So look at verse 11.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.700]   "Smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   for he is worshiper of the beast and its image, and the worshiper receives the mark of its
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   name."
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:31.100]   So, if rest is salvation, unrest is hell.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:38.380]   So if you look at the Garden of Eden, God enters into the Sabbath, Sabbath is broken.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:45.700]   And so the whole redemptive history is trying to restore this rest.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:51.540]   So I think it's a very vivid image of mankind.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:57.100]   Very vivid image, maybe I don't know the right words to describe it, but it gives an image
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:04.060]   of whether you are living in peace or rich or poor or having a lot of friends or few,
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:11.020]   I think mankind in general is at unrest.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.700]   There's something inside of mankind.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.420]   When we talk about there's a void, there's a need to pursue something, to make meaning
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.460]   of life and find purpose for existence, all of this is pointing to unrest.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.020]   We're not at peace, right?
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.700]   And so the Bible describes salvation as restoring that Sabbath, restoring that rest.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:36.580]   And so in Hebrews 4, 1 through 11, I don't think I have that.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.020]   I didn't put that.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:48.620]   So let's turn our Bibles there to Hebrews chapter 4, just a few pages flipped.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.340]   I don't think I have that passage, but I want to read it.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:35:01.420]   So Hebrews chapter 4, 1 through 11.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.860]   I'm just going to read the whole thing, but I want you to pay attention to the word rest
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.420]   and how it's used.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:13.940]   "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands," so again, in chapter
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.660]   4, verse 1, when it says promise of entering this rest, what rest is he referring to?
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.980]   Salvation, right?
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.820]   "While the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.380]   seem to have failed to reach it.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.460]   For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.060]   them because they were not united by faith and with those who listened.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.740]   For we who have believed entered that rest as he has said, 'As I swore in my wrath, they
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.260]   shall not enter my rest.'"
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.980]   So again, repeatedly over again, the word rest is used interchangeably with salvation.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.380]   "Although his works were finished from the foundation of the world, for he has somewhere
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.380]   spoken of the seventh day in this way, and God rested.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.860]   And on the seventh day from all his works," and again, in this passage, he said, "they
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.940]   shall not enter my rest.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.500]   Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.620]   news failed to enter because of his disobedience."
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:19.220]   Again, he appoints a certain day, "today saying through David so long afterward," in the words
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.740]   already quoted, "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:29.520]   For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.940]   Then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:38.320]   For whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.300]   Let us therefore strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by the same sort of
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.300]   disobedience."
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:50.460]   Now, there's more of this doctrine that's stated in the book of Hebrews and other passages,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.500]   but again, the Bible uses the term rest and Sabbath interchangeably with salvation.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.620]   But it's more descriptive.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.420]   Rest is because we've been separated from the agent of rest, which is God.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:12.740]   God entered the rest, and our God the Father has been in the Sabbath where he originally
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.740]   took us.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.300]   So sin caused us to be in unrest.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:23.700]   And that's why this doctrine of Sabbath is so important, central in the Old Testament.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.700]   And then it carries over to the New Testament to teach us about this rest.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:32.660]   So again, when this angel comes, he says those who have the mark of the beast, they will
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.740]   be in torment and unrest.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.060]   They will not be able to find rest for eternity.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:47.500]   And those who enter into God's salvation will be at rest for eternity.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.900]   The last part, the final harvest and the sickle.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:57.840]   You know, typically when we think about the sickle, the angel of death, right?
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.940]   We think of the angel of death with the long hood, and he usually shows up during Halloween
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   and is sickle, and he's the bad guy, right?
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.260]   Who holds the sickle in this scene?
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.660]   Is it the beast?
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.980]   Antichrist?
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.780]   Who holds the sickle?
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.540]   Jesus.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.460]   Jesus holds one of the sickle, and who else holds another sickle?
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.460]   An angel.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.020]   Angel of God holds the sickle.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.860]   So in this text, the angel holding the sickle is God's angel.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.340]   It is not demonic.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.940]   It's God's agent bringing the harvest, meaning that he's going to bring final judgment.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:44.180]   When he says that, you know, before Christ comes, he will not divide between wheat and
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:52.220]   tares, but at that time, when the harvest comes, he will divide, right?
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:59.140]   So we see that Jesus initiates the final harvesting of the world, again, described in Daniel 7,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.980]   13, and 14.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   Okay, let me...
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:09.260]   Daniel 7, 13, and 14, it says, "I saw in the night visions, and behold, the clouds of heaven.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.900]   There came one like a Son of Man."
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:17.500]   So again, the description of the one like the Son of Man is a very specific description
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.060]   of the Messiah, right?
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.840]   And so the term that Jesus used of himself, more than any other term, is Son of Man.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.480]   Not Son of God, right?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.980]   Not the Messiah, but the term that he used most commonly in the context of the Jewish
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.800]   community was Son of Man, right?
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.940]   He described himself Son of Man more than any other.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:42.300]   And that's a very specific description of the Messiah that is described in Daniel chapter
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   7.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.860]   And Daniel chapter 7 describes a man who is eternal, who is from God, right?
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.980]   And so what is being said here is an exact description, or almost verbatim, of what we
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.100]   see in Daniel chapter 7 of this Messiah King that's coming, right?
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.900]   "He's like the Son of Man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.500]   him and to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom that all people's nation languages
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.500]   should serve him.
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.020]   His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.340]   shall not be destroyed."
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:20.740]   And again, in Acts chapter 1, 9, if you remember when Jesus is taken up, he says, "And a cloud
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.500]   took him out of their sight."
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.460]   And then remember the angels say, "As he went, he will come," right?
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.580]   As he went, and he went up in the clouds, and he will return in the clouds.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:37.020]   So that's the description that we see here, right, in Daniel chapter, or the text that
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.340]   we're looking at, right?
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.340]   The earth is described as fully ripe.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.260]   It's ready for harvest.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.100]   And so Jesus came at the fullness of time, right?
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.980]   Again, I mentioned this a couple weeks ago, at the fullness of time when sin became utterly
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:41:01.580]   sinful and Israel's sin has climaxed to its peak where they could not have possibly thought
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.620]   that they can redeem themselves, and God allows that to happen, right?
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.820]   God allows sin to run its full course before he comes.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:15.380]   And at the end times, he said, he is also waiting for the harvest to be full.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.380]   He's going to allow sin to become utterly sinful, but this time he does not come to
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.380]   redeem.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.060]   He will redeem his church, but he will also come to judge.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.340]   And it is the final judgment.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.980]   It is not discipline.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.740]   He's not disciplining the world, hoping that someone will return.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.940]   When the final judgment comes, it is a divide between the weak and the terrorists, right?
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.860]   And that's the judgment that we see here.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   It's fully ripe.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.780]   There's nothing more to wait for, right?
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.900]   And all of that is to set up for the final seven judgments, seven bold judgments in chapter
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   16, right?
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.340]   So I don't know if you've read it yet, but if you've been following us, you're kind of
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:59.500]   like, what is in these bold judgments that all of this is to set up for the six bowls,
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.580]   right?
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:07.500]   So before the millennium comes, before the new heaven and new earth and eternity comes,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:14.060]   there's going to be an increase of turmoil, increase of sin, increase of persecution,
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.260]   increase of wars and famine, and it's going to be intensified.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.980]   So if you're paying attention, you won't miss it, right?
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.180]   That's what it's all setting.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.480]   All of this was a setup for that, okay?
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.020]   It ends with something, and I was kind of debating whether I'm going to get into this
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:37.060]   or not, but it ends by something strange when it says in verse 20, "And the winepress was
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.740]   trodden outside the city, and the blood flowed from the winepress as high as horses' bridle
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.740]   for 1600 stadia," right?
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.860]   And I was debating whether I'm going to get into this.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:52.420]   And I'm just going to mention and move on because no one knows this for sure, but 1600
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:57.420]   stadia is approximately 184 miles, right?
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.380]   Again, this is one of those things that you can look at and take it for a grain of salt.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.500]   You can receive it, not receive it.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.820]   But some of the commentators, or a lot of the commentators who take these things literally,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:15.140]   say 184 miles is approximately the distance of Palestinian land.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:20.060]   And so some of them have interpreted this, that this intense judgment, at least this
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:26.460]   final Armageddon battle and this intense scene where the blood is going to flow and all this
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.740]   stuff that's described by the third angel, and it also describes that it's outside the
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.580]   gate, so outside of Jerusalem would be Palestine.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:41.140]   And so how the judgment is going to be coming upon this particular area, okay?
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.860]   Now you can take that as a grain of salt.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.180]   Again, it's just one of those things that's interesting because the numbers happen to
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.980]   line up and match.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:53.220]   But outside of that, again, it's just an educated guess, okay?
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:58.580]   Let me go over the discussion questions real quick.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.660]   In light of the contrast between darkness and light in chapter 13 and 14, what is the
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.300]   greatest contrast that you have seen in your life before you became a Christian and after?
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:12.180]   I know some of you guys have been a Christian for a while, and some of you guys may not
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:19.260]   remember that well what it was like before you committed your life to Christ, right?
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.740]   But when you think about your walk with God, when you committed your life to Christ, what
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.660]   was the most obvious difference that you saw in your life in darkness and your life in
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.660]   the light?
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.660]   Okay, that's number one.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.140]   Number two, what is something that you didn't understand about Christianity until after
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.180]   you became a Christian?
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.300]   This is related to the 144,000, and they were the only ones who were able to learn the song
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.260]   and the description of their obedience and purity and all of that.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.020]   And so what are some things that you remember that before you became a Christian that you
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.900]   didn't understand and then after you became a Christian?
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:57.180]   The first thing that I thought about was prayer, you know, because I grew up in a Christian
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   home.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.180]   I prayed all my life.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.260]   What I didn't understand was people who really prayed.
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.980]   I understood why people came to church, at least from a non-Christian point of view,
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.940]   because it's social, right?
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.060]   At least that's how I interpret it.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.060]   They come because they need friends, and they want to hang around with their friends and
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.140]   their peers, so that's why they come to church, because I didn't understand the aspect about
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.780]   God, right?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:24.140]   So everything that the church did made some sense to me, because the worship, you know,
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.700]   people worship because it's kind of like a security blanket.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.260]   They hold onto it because, you know, just in case God exists, and it makes you feel
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   better.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.660]   So some people do it through Buddhism, some people do it through Hinduism or Muslim.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.660]   So Christians, this is just their way of holding onto, hoping for something better, right?
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.240]   That's how I understood it, right?
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.060]   But the one thing that I didn't understand is their fervent prayer.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.700]   So, you know, like just going and burning incense and doing some ritual things, like
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.940]   just for your comfort, I can get that, but really clinging, like God's going to answer
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:02.700]   your prayers, like that didn't make sense to me until after I became a Christian, because
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.940]   only if you really believe God would answer prayer would you pray like that, like praying
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.300]   until God answers.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.500]   That didn't make any sense to me, because it didn't fit what I thought was happening
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.220]   in the church, right?
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.420]   So do you remember anything before you were a Christian, certain things that didn't make
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.140]   sense to you until you became a Christian, right?
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.140]   That's what that question is.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.420]   Number three, read 1 John 2, 15-17, it states that if you love the world, the love of the
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:33.100]   Father is not in him, why is it impossible to love both the world and God, right?
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.620]   Again, this is not my statement, this is what it says in that passage.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.500]   How does love of God weed out the love for the world, and how does the love for the world
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.460]   frustrate the love for God?
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.780]   Okay, and that's pretty straightforward.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.780]   So let me pray for us, and I'll break you guys up into your small group.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:53.060]   Again, if you are new to the church and you don't have a small group to be plugged into,
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:57.740]   Jeremy, if you turn your head to your left, he's going to plug you in.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.580]   So if you need to be plugged in somewhere, just go see him and he'll help you find a
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.220]   small group to belong to.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.380]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:12.900]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your living word.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.380]   We pray, Father God, as you promised, that your word would judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.660]   of our heart.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:23.580]   And we know all of these things, Lord God, and some of it is confusing, but we see who
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:31.220]   you are, how you are a God deserving of worship, and how you are so patient with beings that
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.900]   are rebellious, that you can so easily just squash.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:41.460]   We pray that you would allow us to see a greater picture of who you are, so that we may see
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.120]   a greater picture of ourselves.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.340]   We pray, Father, that you would bless the time of our small group, and may it be sharpening
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.500]   as iron sharpening iron.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
