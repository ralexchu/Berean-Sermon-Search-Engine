[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Romans chapter 1, we'll be reading from verse 18-23.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Romans chapter 1, verse 18-23.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And I'm reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   who by their unrighteousness oppress the truth.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   For His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and divine nature,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   in the things that have been made, so they are without excuse.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   For although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank You again for this morning.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   We thank You, Lord God, for the Chung family.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We thank You for the many families, Lord, who are having children.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We thank You, Lord God, for blessing our church, Lord, with many graces.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We ask, Lord, that with all the blessings that You give us,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   that it would return to You in praise and adoration,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   knowing that every good gift comes from You.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize who You are in the midst of all that You've given.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So for that end, we pray that You would open our ears,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   that You would soften our hearts. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   You know, as we've been talking about in the book of Romans,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   that Paul has been introducing the Gospel to the Romans here,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and we talked about how in chapter 1 and all the way up to chapter 3, verse 20,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   his main point is that we recognize why we need Christ.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And without recognizing what it is that we have received,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   what it is that we have been saved from,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   we can say it's grace, but we don't recognize it as amazing grace.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You know, we worship a God, we worship Him, but it's not coming out from an over,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   an abundance of thankfulness, what God has given.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You know, I remember, I know Jeremy is sitting here,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   but I remember when Jeremy was a little kid, you know,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   when he was about 2 1/2 to 3 years old, back when we used to live in Corona,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   we used to have a swimming pool in our backyard,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and his two older cousins, they already knew how to swim,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   so they would jump in the water and go back and forth,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and Jeremy didn't know how to swim at that time.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, right around that time, you know, this one particular day,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and I forget which day it was, but this one particular day,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   my father had a heart attack a week before, so he was in the hospital for a period,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and then we actually picked him up, and on the way back home,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   we stopped at our house.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And so my dad was resting in our backyard, you know,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   like just resting before we sent him back home.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And so we were all inside, and all of a sudden, we hear this splash in the swimming pool,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   so we run out to see our dad, you know, we're all kind of freaking out,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   because he just had a heart attack, and we see our dad in the pool,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   you know, fetching Jeremy out of the water.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And so basically what happened was, you know, his cousins were swimming,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and they went inside, and Jeremy wanted to imitate them,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   so he got on the slide, and he slid into the pool, and he was face down.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So the only adult that was outside was my dad, so he just jumped into the pool.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And again, you know, he just had a heart attack.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He was in the hospital for five days.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So he was soaking wet, and he came out, and I remember when my dad pulled him out of the water,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   that we were expecting Jeremy to be like, you know, choking and crying,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and pulled him out of the water, and he just walked out, and said,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   "Thanks, Grandpa," and then he just walked in.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So obviously, we were watching that, and we were like,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   "That kid has no idea just what happened."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You know, this grandfather, I mean, after five days of being in the hospital,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   he ran in, he sprained his legs, you know, sprained his ankle,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   fetching him out of the water, basically saved his life.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You know, but he's just like, "Oh, thanks, Grandpa," and then he just walked in,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   tiled off, and went out and played with his cousins.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Again, you know why I share this story, because sometimes we receive salvation
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   in a flippant way, and we just kind of, "Thanks, God, thanks for saving me,"
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   you know, "We praise you," and then we go home like nothing happened.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   If we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   what it is that we have been saved from, our response would be just as flippant.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   "Thanks, God," and you say, "Oh, we talk about His grace,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   we talk about salvation and going to Heaven, but it doesn't make any effect on us
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   because we don't recognize exactly what it is that we have been saved from."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And again, you know, when my children are younger,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   you know, one of the things that I used to do to discipline them
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   is that if they did something, I would ask them,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   "What do you think you deserve for this, for what you just did?"
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You know, every once in a while, they'll say something, you know, horrendous,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and I'll say, "Oh, maybe I shouldn't eat for three days," or something like that,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and I'll say, "You know, that's too harsh." You know?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But when they say something like that, I know that they understand the gravity of what they did.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Maybe they hit their sister, or they lied about something,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   and so they are broken for what they did, so they know they deserve the punishment.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so that's all I wanted to hear, is that I wanted to hear that they know the gravity of what they did.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So again, every once in a while, they'll say something, and then I would kind of have to show grace,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and say, "No, no, no, we're not going to go that far, but you understand what you did."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But then every once in a while, they'll do something, and then I'll say, "What do you think you deserve?"
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And then they'll give me something flippant, like, you know, instead of having two candy, let me just have one,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   or something like that, or, "Oh, I won't eat ice cream after dinner." You know, that would be the punishment.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And then I know that they don't fully recognize what they did.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Then I have to sit down and explain to them, "Do you know why that is so hurtful?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Do you know what happens? Do you know the consequence of this behavior?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And then they would adjust, "Okay, then maybe I won't eat for two days," or something.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You know, then they would adjust their punishment, right?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But that's how I know that they recognize exactly what they did.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So whatever punishment is coming their way, to make sure that it's not just punishment,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   they're kind of like, they don't really fully get it, you know?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But, so that whatever punishment it is that comes their way, that they fully understand why that was coming.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   See, in our Christian faith, when we talk about the judgment of God,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   the scripture says the reason why the righteousness of God is being revealed,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   is because the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And when we don't recognize the wrath of God, and why we are deserving of this wrath,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   then even the righteousness of God that is revealed, we're not going to fully comprehend it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   In order to be able to recognize His righteousness being revealed,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and I'm not talking about mentally, I'm talking about spiritually, emotionally.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   To truly be able to recognize and see that, we need to first recognize that you and I,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   every single one of us, we're deserving of this wrath that is being revealed.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Again, we talked about how when we think about wrath, we normally think of thunder.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We think of some sort of a mass, you know, war going on, a mass death or shooting.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So, it's only when we see things like 9/11, I know, you know, just a few days ago,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   we commemorated the, what is it, 14th year of 9/11,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and some of you guys may have been old enough to recognize and be able to fully be impacted
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   by everything that was going on that day.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Watching videos of people screaming in horror, and watching again the buildings falling down,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   it just kind of reminded me of all the emotions that were going on that day.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But when we think of the wrath of God, typically we think of that kind of stuff.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But on a day-to-day basis, we don't really think about that.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   We think of, you know, it's a great day, and we don't want to ruin it by thinking about the wrath of God.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   But the scripture says that the righteousness of God is being revealed
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   because the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And we talked about that last week, how the most tangible evidence of the wrath of God
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   is the death, the universal death of mankind, which God did not intend.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And every single day, I know it's a morbid way to think about life,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   every single day we're getting closer and closer to what is inevitable.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And we try so hard to hold on to our youth, but only for a while.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   You know, some of you young guys are boasting about your energy on the court,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and you make fun of these older guys, you know, saying, "I can't keep up."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Sooner or later, you're going to be there too, you know.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Sooner than later, you know, you're going to be there too, you know.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   That's inevitable. We said that the wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   The wrath of God is being revealed in the futility of life.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   You know, no matter how hard we try, we think like, if we do this, then everything is going to go our way.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And you'll see, in life, ask anybody who's lived 30, 40 plus years,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   if life turned out exactly the way they wanted.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Every single person will say, "Only if I did this, only if I did that."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Futility of life, no matter how hard we work.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And every single person thinks that it's them. It's not just them.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Every human being in this world thinks the same thing.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And then third, and finally, we talked about, which we're going to get into next week,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   about what the ultimate judgment of God is when He finally just lets you go.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And you know, the sad thing is, a lot of times when God lets you go,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   a lot of times, they don't even recognize it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Because you resist God, you kind of like, picked and chose, like,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   "This I'm going to follow, this I don't agree with, this I'm going to do, this I'm not going to do."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And you don't realize that you don't have 30% of God or 80% of God.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   You have none of God.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You don't pick 70% of God and 30% choose to not.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He said, "Either you will follow me, either you are with me, or you are against me."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   There is nothing in between.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And so when God chooses to turn you over during this life,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   you know, we talked about that last week, where your heart gets hardened to the point
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   where the grace of God is no longer affecting you at all.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And you kind of, just kind of coast along in the Christian culture, and that's about it.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And then the final result of this handing over happens after we die,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   where God's grace is withdrawn, and His presence is no longer active,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   at least not in His grace.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And all of this stuff is being revealed.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And the reason why it's being revealed in that way is what he's getting to in verse 9, or 19.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   He says, "Because the truth of God is being suppressed by unrighteousness."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And he says, "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   God has made it plain to them.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   "For His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and His divine nature,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world, and the things that have been made,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   so they are without excuse."
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   You know, most of you who went to secular universities,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   you probably read that the secular universities tend to lean left.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They tend to be more atheistic.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And so if you've gone to secular university, you almost kind of come out thinking
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   that science and Christianity somehow doesn't mix.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   That if you pursue science, if you have questions and you pursue it too hard,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   somehow you're going to end up questioning, "Do I really believe this?"
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And "Can it be?"
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So you kind of keep the scientific aspect of it very vague.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You leave it up to the professionals.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I'm just going to stick to theology.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   But that's not what the scripture says.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Scripture actually says, "He left His imprint on His creation."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So according to scripture, the more you study science without bias,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   the more you take a deep look at His creation,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   that you're going to see a greater imprint of God, not the opposite.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Okay, I have an article here.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   How many of you have ever seen the show "This Old House"?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Okay, a few of you.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And you guys are all a little bit older than other people.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   All right, so "This Old House" is a show basically--
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   it's a home improvement show.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And at the end of the show, the host would come out,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and they would bring a little product from 100 years ago, 150 years ago,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and they'd say, "What do you think this is used for?"
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And every single one of them would take a guess.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "Oh, that's this, and that's this."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So I brought something from my house to get you to take a guess.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   What do you think this is made of?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   All right, let's keep going.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Just take a guess.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Somebody in the first service said CD holder.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I could see it.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   One end of a CD holder, maybe.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Okay, so you guys are confused.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   What did you say it was?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Jack stand, what is that?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Okay, that's good.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   All right, so that's exactly what this is.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Usually the show doesn't go like that.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   They all get it wrong.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Thanks for helping with the illustration.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Anyway, basically what this is, if you've ever had a flat tire,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   you know how you put it under the car and then you raise the car up,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   but they don't use this anymore because so many cars would fall out,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and it's not stable.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   If it's not on solid ground, if you don't hook it on the right thing,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   it kind of slips out, right?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   So it's kind of dangerous, so they stopped making this.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So those of you who've only been driving for the last 10 years,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   you probably haven't seen this in your car, right?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So basically what this is, you put it under the car and they would jack it up,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and then one by one, you would raise your car.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   That's what this is. This is one end of it.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I have no idea why I had this in my garage,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   but I looked for something that I thought maybe you would have a hard time figuring out.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But the point of my story is that when they have that,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and they bring these products out, they would guess.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   It was made for this, it was made for that.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I've never seen, in all the years that I've been watching this show,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I've never seen somebody come out and say, "I think it's just part of nature."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I think in billions of years, the metal particles just kind of flew together and created this.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   So nobody actually made this, it just happened.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Now if I told you that that's what this was, there's no purpose,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I just found this, I went digging, I just found it,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and it's just part of nature. It just happened.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And after billions of years, it just kind of somehow figured out, got together.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Now this is just a piece of metal. This is just a piece of metal.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It doesn't think, there's less complicated thing to bring this together
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   than a little tip of your finger has more details and more complex than this.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Yet, the world tells us that everything around us, the universe, the human being,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   the eyeball, the fingertips, all of this happened by chance.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   You would never accept if I said this was just by chance.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It just showed up. It had no purpose. Nobody made it. It just happened.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And yet, all the great supposed great minds have concluded that that's the case.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And so many Christians hear this and it's like, "Can I be a Christian and believe this and not believe this?"
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, the scripture makes it very clear that God left his imprint on creation.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   There's a man named William Dembski. He wrote a book called "Design Inference"
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and was published by Cambridge University Press.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And in it, he describes this and how supposedly these great minds of the world in our generation,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   how they are suppressing the truth that many other scientists claim.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Richard Dawkins, I know many of you probably heard his name before.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   He's an atheist who goes around and debates other Christians.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And basically says, "If you're a Christian, you're stupid." Basically, that's what he says.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And this is one of the quotes that he has.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   He says, Richard Dawkins claims that, "Biology is the study of complicated things
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And the reason why he quotes it and says there's an appearance of design
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   is because you may naturally look at, and the more you study it,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   it seems like there has to be some kind of design.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   But what he's arguing is, you've got to throw that away.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You may naturally think that way, but you've got to suppress that because God doesn't exist.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   He quotes another man, Francis Crick, who is a co-discoverer of DNA.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And he says this, "Biologists must constantly keep in mind
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   In other words, you may study in biology and how the body works and all that stuff
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and naturally conclude there must be a design, but you must suppress this.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Because God doesn't exist.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Because he already concluded God doesn't exist.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So even though all these things must point to some kind of intelligent design,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   you have to get that out of your system.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   In fact, many, many scholars, many physicists, engineers, scientists,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and I'm going to read you some of the quotes that he quotes.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Tony Rothem, a physicist, says this,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "When confronted with the order and beauty of the universe
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and the strange coincidences of nature,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   it's very tempting to take the leap of faith from science into religion.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I am sure many physicists want to. I only wish they would admit it."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Paul Davies, a British astrophysicist, says,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   "The laws of physics seem to be the product of exceedingly ingenious design.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   The universe must have a purpose."
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Vera Kistiakowsky, and I'm butchering his name, he's an MIT physicist,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   he says, "The exquisite order displayed by our scientific understanding
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   of the physical world calls for the divine."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Arthur Shalau, professor of physicist at Stanford University,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   he was a Nobel Prize winner of physics in 1981, and he says this,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "It seems to me that when confronted with the marvels of life and the universe,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   one must ask why and not just how.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The only possible answers are religious.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I find a need for God in the universe and in my own life."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And then finally, Werner Von Braun, pioneer of rocket engineering, says,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   "I find it as difficult to understand scientists who does not acknowledge
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   In other words, he's saying that these two things are not in contradiction.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And that's exactly what the scripture says.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   That God deliberately left His imprint on His creation.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Just like if we were to look at this and we wanted to find out what this is.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   You say, "Well, we find out it's a car jack.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And if we wanted to find the creator of this, we can find something.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   He must know something about cars.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   He may have been hired by an automobile industry.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Maybe he has some kind of engineering background because in order to know
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   if this is going to work, obviously plastic is not going to do.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   So he needs to have some knowledge of material science."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   So based upon just this one little thing, we can deduce certain things about the creator.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Looking at the complexities of the universe, the scripture says
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   that what may be known about God, His invisible attributes,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   His power, His divine nature, have been clearly seen
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   because God deliberately left an imprint of Himself in creation.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Psalm 119, 1-6, it says, "The heaven declares the glory of God,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and the sky above proclaims His handiwork.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   There is no speech, nor are there words whose voice is not heard.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Their measuring line goes out through all the earth,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and their words to the end of the world.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   In them He has set a tent for the sun."
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Again and again, scripture declares that God left His imprint.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Now why did He do that?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Now obviously, you can't be saved by looking at the world and say,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   "Oh, you know, it seems like God does exist."
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Nobody can be saved by general revelation.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   But Paul describes in Acts 17 what the purpose of this general revelation is.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Acts 17, 24-28, it says, "The God who made the world and everything in it,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   nor is He served by human hands as though He needed anything,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   since He Himself gives to all mankind like the breath and everything.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   having determined allotted periods and boundaries of their dwelling."
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And here, this is the point, verse 27, after he says all of this,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   "God is the creator of all of this, of mankind, of nations," verse 27,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   "that they should seek God in the hope that they might feel their way toward Him and find Him.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yet He is actually not far from each one of us, for in Him we live and move and have our being."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   He said the reason why He left His imprint upon His creation
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   is so that they may recognize, that you and I would recognize,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   there must be a designer. And this designer must be a powerful designer.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   That maybe He's a creative designer. And He left all of this so that we may find ourselves.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Again, the general revelation is not the gospel.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   But He said the general revelation would lead us to look for Him.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   If there is a designer, who is He? Can I have a relationship with Him?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And I remember when I was saved, when I made the sinner's prayer,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   that was a thought that I had. I always said that I believed because I was raised in a Christian home.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   But He was not a personal God. Until I saw a group of Christians who were praying like God really listened.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And then I started asking myself, "Does that God really listen?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Is He somebody I can personally know?" And that's when I made, first time I prayed,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I mean I prayed all my life, before meals, at Sunday school.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   The first time in my life I prayed, "God, if You're really there, I want to know You."
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And that's what caused my eyes to be opened. And the scripture says,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   God left His imprint for that purpose. So that we would recognize that there is this powerful being,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   this divine being, that we would search our way with Him.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And then He concludes by saying, "Yet He actually is not far from you.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   For in Him we live and move and have our being."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   If you are genuinely interested in God, you don't have to go far to see.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   We can give credit to the scientists and say, "You know what? The reason why we woke up this morning
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   is because the scientists figured out how to keep this earth rotating at the exact same speed
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   for thousands and thousands of years. And the reason why we didn't burn out in the night
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   is because they somehow figured out how to keep the earth at the exact distance.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Not too far, not too close. And constant all the time.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So either we can wake up and say, "I woke up because human beings figured out how to live.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   We figured out how to keep the oxygen here. We figured out how to eat. We figured out how to live.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And that's why we were produced. We figured out how to make babies.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And that's why we have babies." Or you can recognize that the only reason why you and I
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   live and breathe and wake up and go to sleep is because there is a God who created all of this.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And so that's what Paul says, that if you are willing, He is not far. He is near.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And God deliberately made it that way. But here's the punchline.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Even though he left all of this in print, the scripture says, "For although they knew God,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking."
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And because they became futile in their thinking, they became darkened in their heart,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   claiming to be wise. Sounds a lot like today, doesn't it? Claiming to be wise.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   You know, they say, "Ah, you Christians, you don't know anything." And then when you sit down
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and actually try to have an intelligent conversation, they can't go beyond the prejudice.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   They claim to be wise, but they became fools. They exchanged the glory of the immortal God
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   for images resembling mortal man. Before we say, "Oh, okay, that's why the Gentiles are judged.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That's why they were judged." We may look at that and say, "Well, thank God we're not like them."
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Let's take a step back and look into what they struggled with. He said, "They exchanged the glory of God
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   for foolishness of idols." Idolatry. You know, I always question,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   why did the nation of Israel struggle with idolatry? Did you ever see pictures of the idols
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that Israel struggled with? They are ugly. You know what I mean? If it was a Lamborghini,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I was like, "Okay, I can see. I see why." You know what I mean?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It was something, but they're ugly. It seems like some third grade art project
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   that failed some contest, and that's the thing that they chose to be the idol.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And Israel constantly walking by, "Oh, maybe I'll worship that."
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   When I first started reading, it didn't make any sense to me, because here are these people
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   that God called "apple of my eye." He delivered them. They saw the miracle
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   of the 10 plagues. They saw God open up the Red Sea and swallowing up their enemies,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   gave them supernatural food and water, protected them from their enemies,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   walked into Jericho without a single man being lost. They saw all the miracles of God.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   God coming in His Shekinah glory. And yet, every time they were presented by these idols,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   they said, "Oh, maybe we'll worship that." What was it about these idols that was so attractive
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   that they would do something so foolish? It is foolish, and that's exactly what the Scripture says.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   They became darkened in their heart and futile, dumb in their thinking.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But why was it so attractive? What was the first idol that Israel wrestled with?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Do you remember? Golden calf, right? The golden calf.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   As soon as they come out, Moses goes up to the mountain and he receives the 10 commandments,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and the people start stirring up, saying, "Why is he taking so long?" Right?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So they became antsy, like, "He left us out in the desert. Oh no, who's going to protect us?"
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And so Aaron has a great idea, so let's get all the gold and melt it and make it into a golden calf.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And then he presents it to them, and then when he presents it to them, he says,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   "Here's your Yahweh that you've been waiting from the sky. Here He is."
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   So it wasn't straight up idolatry, it was kind of syncretism.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   They were kind of mixing some of the Egyptian background.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   But the reason why, why this golden calf? Right?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   All of a sudden this golden calf appears. Not only appears at that time,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   do you remember that golden calf? All throughout Israel's history it became a stumbling block.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Do you remember when the northern kingdom and the southern kingdom splits in half after Solomon?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Because of David's sin, the kingdom splits in two.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So Rohoboam takes the south, and Jeroboam goes up north, and he takes ten of the tribes with him.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   But he doesn't want the Israelites in that side to come to Jerusalem to worship,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   because he's afraid if they come to Jerusalem that he's going to lose his people.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So he sets up this golden calf worship in Dan and Bethel, and he said,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "You don't have to go there, you can worship this calf here."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And he presents it again, "Here's your Yahweh, worship it."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And all throughout Israel's history they were stumbling over this worship of this golden calf.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Now, I know a calf is not the ugliest of the animals, you know what I mean?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Maybe they chose the best looking animal, I don't know. Right?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   But when you look back in history, the worship of a bull or a calf in Egypt was one of their popular idols.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And the reason why is because it represented fertility.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Now you have to think, at that time, calves and animals represented riches.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   So it's like today, it's basically worshiping money.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So if they worshiped this idol, they were thinking that somehow the blessing of whatever is going to come through this animal.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So if you were to think of it today, it's kind of like chasing after money. Right?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Because in their mind, if they worship Yahweh, and then He leads us out to the desert,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and we're not seeing the milk and honey flowing, maybe if He's not going to do it, maybe this calf is going to do it.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And we'll worship it. And they never fully, completely got rid of it.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Even in times of revival, they would do this and they would kind of keep that.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   So we can kind of see, you know, we talk about idols, "Oh, we don't do that.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   We don't have any golden calves or anything set up in our backyard. We're too sophisticated." Right?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   You don't have any ashtray. I mean, if you are, you're in big trouble. Right?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   You know, Christians, non-Christians will make fun of you.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   But you know what an idol, idol basically is replacing God with something else.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Just like he says, instead of worshiping the Creator, you worship the creation in the image of us.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So whatever will suit us, we go after.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   So you don't have to have an idol. You don't have to have a physical product.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Whatever is in your heart that you worship becomes your idol.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   You have the calf worship and then the two other worship when they go into the promised land that they struggle with.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You have the ball worship, and you know that. Right?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   The ball worship keeps coming up. And you know what ball worship was?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   It was a god of, you can guess, fertility. Right?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Again, god of fertility.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And so they were easily, if they came and then God didn't provide for them what they wanted,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   they basically dropped him and went to ball worship.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Look at the Canaanites. Look how well they're doing.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And maybe the reason why they're flowing with milk and honey is because they're worshiping this ball.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   So that's why they were so tempted.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   We'll go worship that. Now again, today we're a lot more sophisticated than that.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   We don't go and say, "I'm going to worship a ball. We're going to set up a shrine for money."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   We don't set up a piggy bank.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And then every time we walk in, we rub the belly.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And maybe some people do, but we don't do it that way. Right?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   All that idolatry happens in our heart. Right?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Where that becomes our priority and that's what we're pursuing.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And that becomes our idol. So we can easily see why ball worship was so tempting to them.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   There's another idol that was very prominent.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Anybody remember any Bible scholars?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Such with the A?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Asherah Pole.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Again, hideous. If you ever type in Asherah Pole in Google, it is a hideous, hideous looking thing.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Why was that so popular? Why did Israel keep falling into that temptation?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Well, Asherah was a female version of ball and it was known as a goddess of love and war.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And so whenever they had political conflict or they felt like maybe one family to another
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   in order to be a conqueror, to dominate, they would worship this goddess.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And another added benefit for the pagan worship was because she was a goddess of love,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and again equated with fertility, they would have mandatory prostitution at Asherah's temple.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   So oftentimes, whatever worship that they have for Asherah would end in some kind of orgy,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   some kind of sexual immorality.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And you see that all throughout Israel's history.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And then by the time you get to the time of Christ, that was one of the primary things that Paul had to deal with
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   when the gospel began to go out to the Gentile world.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Sexual immorality because they kept on going back to the temple.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Even though they were worshiping Yahweh, they would keep going back to the sexual immoral behavior
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   through whatever idol that they were worshiping.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Now every single, I don't think there's a single person in this room, I don't think,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   and I can pretty much bet that you don't have Asherah poles and you don't have Baal,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   you don't have Golden Calf set up somewhere.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   But I would be equally confident that that idolatry, what they represented, is prevalent in our hearts.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It is prevalent in all of our hearts.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   We naturally are idolaters.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I know that may be difficult for some of you to swallow.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   We naturally give credit to the creation rather than the creator.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So we feel more confident. We celebrate when we get a little raise and we say, "Thank God for His blessing."
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And we feel more confident at peace over that, over our own salvation.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   We think about the things that we celebrate.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   You know, we celebrate the Great Wall.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people come to celebrate this wall.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And it's a big joke because I've been to the wall so many times and that's not Great Wall, it's just a wall.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   You know? Because we've been there so many times.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   But you know, people come and say, "It's this Great Wall. It spans over 5,000 miles.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   You know, it took 500 years, three or four dynasties.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   It's the only structure you can see from space.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And basically it's just a tiny line. That's the only structure."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And they celebrate. This is awesome.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And then to completely miss the mountains that it is built on.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And you celebrate this tiny piece of line. It's the stone that the people put together.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And you climb up the mountain to see this and then completely miss the mountain.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   That was created by God.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Think about the tallest buildings.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   You know, you go to New York and at one point Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And people pay hundreds of dollars just to go on the elevator and go on the top and say, "This is tall."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And they celebrate. People pay hundreds of dollars.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And yet when they're up there, they look up at the sky and there's no end in God's creation.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And completely miss that whole thing.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You go to the Hoover Dam and you celebrate this Great Wall
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   to prevent this tons and tons of water that it holds back.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And instead of celebrating this creation, this magnitude of water that just sits behind this tiny little wall,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   we come back amazed by the wall that the men created.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   We naturally give credit to creation rather than the Creator.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   We completely miss the point.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We are idolaters at heart.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   We naturally, even when we talk about church growth, we can say, "God bless us, God bless us."
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   But then when you see the books being written, it's all about what men did and who did it.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   What strategies did they use? How is the church organized?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   How does discipleship look?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   What's the teaching like?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And we give credit to man instead of the Creator.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   So our confidence comes from man-made things.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   If we're not careful, we're guilty of the exact same thing.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   That we are overjoyed by the promises of men, but when we read the promises of God, it does nothing.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   See, the Scripture says, "This is why the wrath of God is coming."
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Why is God so offended by this? And why is this such a great sin?
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Because it is thievery. It's robbery.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   What if somebody just came and, you know, like Picasso drew this painting, it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and somebody comes and says, "Nah, it's not Picasso."
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   You know?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   That's His. He created that. And if you don't give Him the credit, you're robbing Him of His glory.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   If we don't recognize that our very breath is from Him.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   You know, we wake up, and again, even as Christians, we think, "God's shown me some kind of miracle."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   We're waiting for God to walk on waters. We're waiting for God to stop the rain.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And we're waiting for some miraculous things to happen.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   But remember what Jesus said to Thomas?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   When he was resurrected, He said, "I'm not going to believe it until I see Him."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   So Jesus shows up, allows Thomas to touch his scars, and He recognizes this is Jesus.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   He falls to the ground, and He worships Him, "My Lord and my God."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Remember what Jesus says? Jesus doesn't say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Remember what He says?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   "You believe because you saw. Blessed are those who do not see, and yet they believe."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   For years, I had no idea what He was talking about.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Of course He would believe, because He saw.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Of course we would believe if we saw. If you would just reveal yourself.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   If you would just show yourself. If you would just speak, and let me know. Make it clear.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And yet, the Scripture says that God has made it plain.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   That it is not because God is playing hide and seek with us.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   That He is hidden somewhere, and He's waiting for us to come out, figure it out, and then, "Oh, there He is!"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   He said He has made it plain, but we have become so saturated with the thinking of this world,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   that we completely miss Him.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   We're standing at the Great Wall, looking at the vast mountain, and saying, "God, where are You?"
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Wake up in the morning with breath in our nostrils again.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   "God, where are You?"
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   We're able to sleep. You see little children being born.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   It's amazing. Anybody who's seen their child being born, it's amazing that they don't die.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I don't know about you, those of you parents, especially the young parents,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   when they hand you your child for the first time, and you bring that child home,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   it's amazing. Like, they're going to, you know what I mean?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I can't even handle a little puppy. You know what I mean?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I'm afraid that I'm not going to feed it. You know, I'm going to forget to feed it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I'm going to forget to bring it. I mean, you bring a baby alive, and God gives me this life?
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And we experience all of that, and we say, "Where are You, God?"
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Because we completely miss it. We have a tendency to miss God.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   And that's why the Scripture says, because mankind refused to give credit where credit is due.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And instead of worshiping Him and giving Him glory, we exchanged the glory of God for mankind.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   We chose to celebrate idols. We choose to celebrate money. We choose to celebrate safety.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   We choose to celebrate the promises given to us by this world,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and trivialize the things that God has given.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   We celebrate the trivial things while trivializing our mighty God.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And that's why the Scripture says, "The wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Until we recognize that we are these people, there will be no repentance.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   That it is a danger for us to read these Scriptures and say, "Oh, I'm glad. That's why they needed Jesus."
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And then we're going to talk about the Jews, and that's why they needed Jesus.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   But thank God, I'm okay.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   The moment that we forget what it is that we have been saved from, we are also in danger to drift away.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I want to invite you guys this morning to take some time again to pray, and to ask yourself,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "What are the idols in your heart?"
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Do you celebrate the promises that your boss gives you, or your friends give you?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And you're so filled with thankfulness of somebody remembering your birthday.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And yet when it comes to the gift of salvation of Jesus Christ, it's kind of like, "Thank you. Thank you."
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   We say, "Thank you," but we don't worship Him.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   We're bored with Him, because we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   We don't recognize who He is, and we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Is that us?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer, that God would truly open our eyes.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   That He would open our eyes and soften our hearts.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   That He would save us from feudal thinking.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He would save us from darkened hearts.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   That we may worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   As we ask our worship team to come up, take some time to, again, to pray.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And to see if you've climbed big hills to completely miss Him.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   That you've been coming to church every single Sunday.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And you've been looking for human comfort, rather than God's.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   You've been looking for human connection, human organization, human talent, human energy.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But you haven't been looking for God.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Let's take this time to come before the Lord.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And if we've been missing the point, to come before God and say, "Lord, open my eyes."
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "That I may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   "That I may worship You in spirit and in truth."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.600]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
