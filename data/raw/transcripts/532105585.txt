[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.140]   You know, I want to embarrass Karen a little bit more, but if you guys know about our travels
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.040]   to India, Karen was actually the first optometrist to go with us our first year, and so she was
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.020]   very much a trailblazer of sorts.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.440]   And in India, what she would do is we would set up this kind of like eye tent, and there
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.260]   was like a black curtain over it.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.320]   You needed that in order to examine eyes, and it would be super stuffy.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.880]   You know, you couldn't breathe in it, and she'd just be in there and just soldiering
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.440]   on, and you know, she's 4'11", you know, and we were in this remote part in India, and
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.240]   she's just soldiering on.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.560]   As I was just listening to her testimony, you know, someone who had no intention of
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.580]   seeking God, and God knows, though.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.500]   He's going to save her, and then years later, He's going to place her in some random village
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.200]   in India, and she's going to do His work, and that is glory to God.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.480]   You know, this entire week, we've been here at church listening to devotions by several
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.100]   leaders, and it's been incredibly encouraging just to see such a big portion of the church
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.240]   here to give worship and glory to our God, because He deserves it.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.080]   And I was just thinking about this today as I was preparing for tonight's devotion.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.360]   I remember being at this church and not really knowing how to worship God.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.040]   I remember it very well, because I was in college.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.280]   I was just left college.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.560]   I was 22 at the time.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.600]   And just echoing what Karen said, I'm so thankful for this church.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.200]   I'm thankful for Pastor Peter, that God gave him the convictions that he has, and that
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.280]   just many years later, God is continuing to work, and His kingdom will always continue,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.480]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it as a church invades the world.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.280]   And I hope you guys get to know that in a deeper way.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.560]   So before I continue to ramble, because I can do that, why don't we pray and get to
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560]   the devotion, okay?
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   Let's do that.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.160]   Father, we thank You, Lord, for Your Word.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.680]   We thank You that You have made it clear to us what You desire for us, Lord, that You
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.280]   have provided everything for salvation.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.640]   You are the one who chose us.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.780]   You are the one who regenerated us.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.400]   You are the one who have placed in us this faith.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.360]   And Lord, as we live a life that is grace-fueled, Lord, help us to live a life that is worthy
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.800]   of the calling that we have received.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.640]   And we know, Lord, that there is no area of our life that is untouched, Father.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.120]   And so because every area of our life depends on how highly we think of You, especially
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.600]   this week as it is the cornerstone of our faith, help us to think deeply, Lord, of the
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.080]   events that transpired, that we might look forward, Lord God, to seeing You again.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.880]   Lord, I pray, Lord, that the words that I say tonight, Lord, that they would come from
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.600]   You and anything that I say that is not of You that You would take away.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.160]   So give us this time and pray these things and name Your Son.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   Amen.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   Okay, so today is Thursday of Passion Week, and there are several events that occur on
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760]   Thursday of Passion Week.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000]   The most significant, arguably, is the institution of communion.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.640]   Now the inauguration of communion, we know, though, had a previous shadow, right?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.720]   When Jesus institutes communion for the first time, He was building upon Passover.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.560]   So Passover was this shadow, and Jesus is giving the actual flesh to it.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.920]   He's giving the substance to it, right?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.600]   So we find the Passover instructions in Exodus 12, verses 1 through 13.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.480]   And I'm going to read it for us because it's relevant here, okay?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.560]   Exodus 12, 1 through 13, says this, "Now the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.760]   Egypt, 'This month shall be the beginning of months for you.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.640]   It is to be the first month of the year for you.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.200]   Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month, they are each
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.600]   one to take a lamb for themselves, according to the father's households, a lamb for each
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   household.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.720]   Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.640]   are to take one according to the number of persons in them.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.440]   In proportion to what each one should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.760]   Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.240]   You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.680]   You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.040]   Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.480]   Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.920]   lintel of the houses in which they eat.'"
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.280]   The lintel is the top part.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   The doorposts are on the sides.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.200]   "They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.320]   unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.960]   Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roast it with fire,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   both its head and its legs, along with its entrails.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.600]   And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.640]   morning you shall completely burn with fire.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.840]   Now you shall eat it in this way, with your garment belted around your waist and your
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.240]   sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand, and you shall eat it in a hurry.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.640]   It is the Lord's Passover.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.720]   For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night and fatally strike all the firstborn
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.240]   in the land of Egypt, from the human firstborn to animals, and against all the gods of Egypt
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.200]   I will execute judgments.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.760]   I am the Lord.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.320]   The blood shall be a sign for you in the houses where you live.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.200]   And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will come upon you to destroy
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.540]   you when I strike the land of Egypt."
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:33.520]   We don't exactly know when the exodus happened, but it's about 1200 to 1400 years before Christ
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.320]   appears on the scene.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.800]   So that would mean for about 1200 to 1400 years, the nation of Israel, or at least the
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:49.960]   faithful ones, would practice this God-ordained sacrament, reminding them, teaching them,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.880]   and even giving hope in times of despair of who God is, what he had done in the past,
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.160]   and that he is in complete control of all things, because this is taking place on an
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.480]   international scale.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.680]   So when we fast forward to the time of Jesus and his apostles, when he takes the last Passover
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:20.080]   before his crucifixions, what we see is we see Jesus giving instructions, the disciples
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.940]   implementing those instructions, and then the eventual celebration.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.720]   This is what Matthew 26, 17 to 29 says.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.480]   Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.360]   do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.880]   And he said, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The teacher says my time
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   is near.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.360]   I am keeping the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.000]   The disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve, and as they
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.000]   were eating, he said, "Truly I say to you that one of you will betray me."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   Being deeply grieved, they began saying to him, each one, "Surely it is not I, Lord."
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.080]   And he answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the bowl is the one who will betray
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.120]   me.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.320]   The Son of Man is going away just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.840]   whom the Son of Man is betrayed.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.680]   Then Judas, who was betraying him, said, 'Surely it is not I, Rabbi.'
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.880]   Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself.'"
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.760]   Now while they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a blessing, he broke it and
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.580]   gave it to his disciples and said, "Take, eat.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.120]   This is my body."
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.520]   And when he had taken a cup and given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.600]   all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.920]   of sins.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.080]   But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now until that day
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.680]   when I drink it with you new in my Father's kingdom."
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.920]   So what Jesus is doing here, he is taking a centuries-old tradition, okay?
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:25.760]   The centuries-old tradition that for the nation of Israel has been the most significant redemptive
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   event in their history.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.640]   It is the most significant event.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:38.880]   He's taking that event, and he's saying that's actually a shadow.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.160]   The 10 plagues, the passing over, the parting of the Red Sea where you guys were baptized
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.600]   with the Red Sea, that's actually a shadow.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:01.720]   Consider the absolute arrogance of Jesus if he is lying, but the exorbitant grace of God
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.640]   if he is telling the truth.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:12.600]   The exorbitant grace because if he's telling the truth, in their lifetime, the shadow is
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   finding fulfillment.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.920]   The shadow is finding fulfillment.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:27.200]   And as great as that event was, they are going to see the actual substance of it.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:37.360]   Of course, for us as God's children, we are absolutely sure that this is indeed the fulfillment.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.320]   There are other people in the world right now who are celebrating the shadow.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.520]   Many of them do it sincerely.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.820]   But not because of anything we've done.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.320]   We celebrate the substance.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.840]   Christ is our Passover lamb.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.800]   And notice what it says in verse 29 here.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   Notice what it says.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.600]   I refer to the last Passover meal with the disciples because that is what it is before,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.760]   prior to the resurrection.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.040]   But in verse 29, he says, "But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.200]   from now until that day when I drink it with you new in my Father's kingdom."
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.640]   There's going to be an actual day when Jesus will drink with his apostles new in his Father's
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   kingdom.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:29.160]   A day that has not been fulfilled yet, even for us, but that will find its fulfillment
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.720]   in the future.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:41.600]   So for us, communion, the substance of Passover, commemorates our hope based on an event that
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.480]   took place in the past, but sustains us now.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.720]   And it gives us hope for the future.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   At the end of this meal, they probably would have sang Psalm 136 together.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.920]   Psalm 136 has about 26, it has 26 verses.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.400]   So I'm not going to read it to you.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.040]   But you could break it up into three general parts.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.680]   The first general part deals with God as King of the universe, as creator and sustainer
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.020]   of the universe.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.020]   And there's an oft repeated phrase.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.520]   And that oft repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.660]   For his loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.580]   The second general part speaks of the Exodus account.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:32.560]   How God rescued them through various miracles, and how God led them out through the Red Sea
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.800]   and gave them land as an inheritance.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.520]   And again, the oft repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.600]   For his loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:53.040]   The third part, the shortest part, is a concluding section that ends with Israel understanding
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.440]   who they are, a humble nation, rescued from their adversaries and from their adversities.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.320]   And the oft repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.640]   For his loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.920]   It sounds pretty triumphant, right?
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.520]   I mean, his loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   And that's what they would have sang together.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:30.080]   So if that is the case, why is it that in the next arc of the story, they are filled
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.740]   with sorrow?
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.520]   Not godly sorrow that leads to repentance, worldly sorrow.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:43.800]   That sorrow where you just want to sleep because you want to check out from reality.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.980]   The sorrow that we've all experienced, where it's just too much.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.600]   And we just say, "I'm so tired.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.440]   I'm going to go to sleep and pretend that reality isn't real."
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.360]   Well, you read about it in Matthew, right?
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.600]   They were grieved because one of them was going to betray him.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:08.000]   But in order to feel the punch just a little bit more, it helps to look at John chapters
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.900]   13 to 17, the upper room discourse.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.800]   Because in John chapter 13 to 17, we have what the synoptic gospels kind of leave out.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.440]   So I'm going to do like a bird's eye view, kind of like a jet flyover of John chapter
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.400]   13 to 17, because I want you to feel that punch.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.320]   In John chapter 13, we see Jesus.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.880]   He takes a towel, he wraps it around himself.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   And then he motions to his disciples that he's going to wash their feet.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.160]   And remember for these disciples, they didn't have the comfy new balance, right?
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.600]   I mean, with the memory foam, their feet were dirty, right?
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.320]   It was extremely dirty.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.600]   So you have this picture here of the king of the universe stooping down to wash the
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.460]   feet of sinners.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:04.000]   And afterwards, he tells his disciples, "You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.820]   But if a teacher and Lord does this, then you ought to do for one another."
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.880]   It would be after this moment that Jesus breaks the news to them that one of them will betray
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   him.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:24.440]   Judas, upon leaving, afterwards, Jesus predicts his coming glory and tells his disciples that
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.960]   he would be with them for a little longer.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:34.880]   And just as he had told the Jews earlier that where he is going, they could not come.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.240]   And as someone who is getting ready to be dispatched on a mission of certain death,
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   he is leaving behind important instructions, instructions for them to know.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.140]   So that command is to love one another.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:55.480]   But Simon Peter, more interested in where he's going, it's like he almost disregards
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.180]   these instructions and he asks him, "Where are you going?"
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:05.180]   Jesus responds, saying, "Where I'm going, you cannot follow, but you will later."
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.340]   And you know the response to this, right?
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.060]   "I'll follow you to death."
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:18.940]   And Jesus says, "Well, before the rooster crows, you are going to deny me three times."
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:28.860]   And so despite the fact that it will be Jesus, he will be the one that will be before this
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:34.460]   illegal quasi-judicial kangaroo court.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:42.660]   He is the one doing the comforting as opposed to the other way around.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.060]   In John chapter 14, Jesus tells his disciples that although he is leaving, he is leaving
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.420]   to go to prepare a place for them, that he would come back, that he would take them to
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.100]   himself.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.360]   That they need not be concerned about seeing the Father because if you had seen Jesus,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.100]   you have seen the Father.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.700]   And that it was to their advantage that he was leaving because he could send a helper.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:15.140]   The helper was with them, but then the helper would now be in them.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:21.900]   The great shepherd, the one they had been walking with over the last three years, the
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.800]   one whom they saw walk on water, feed thousands upon thousands, control the elements, heal
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.680]   the mute, deaf, and blind, the one who had power over death.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.760]   This same Jesus was now going to leave.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.480]   Jesus understands that punch.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.560]   So he tells them, "I'm not leaving you as orphans.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560]   You guys are thinking I'm leaving you.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.680]   I'm not leaving you as orphans.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   The Holy Spirit is going to be in you.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.440]   And to give you a little primer on discernment, the real believers are the ones who follow
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   my word.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.520]   They are the ones who love me."
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:13.840]   And it's almost like he's telling his apostles, "In case you ain't taking notes, in the event
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:21.040]   this news is causing you to hyperventilate, in case either you will misremember or not
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.320]   remember at all, the helper is going to come, and he's going to guide you into all truth.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.440]   He will bring to remembrance all the things I have said to you.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.200]   And so you are going to be crushed, absolutely crushed by my death."
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.600]   But he is telling them in advance so that they would believe.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.760]   What's going to happen isn't some random, chaotic series of unforeseen events where
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.960]   things got out of control.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.920]   Maybe we should have just pleased Judas.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.920]   What's going to happen is quite the opposite.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   Scripture needs to be fulfilled, and the Father is the one sending the Son to the cross.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.480]   In John chapter 15, Jesus will go on exhorting them to abide in him, stating again to love
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.120]   one another, to remember that when the world hates them, they do so because the world hated
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.400]   Jesus first.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.040]   In John chapter 16, he again reminds them of the Holy Spirit, that the Holy Spirit will
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.680]   convict the world concerning sin and righteousness, and that he had much more to say, he had much
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:41.840]   more to say, but because of their grief, they could not bear it now.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.200]   They would all eventually all scatter and leave, and so Jesus encourages them in John
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:53.920]   chapter 16 verse 33, "These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.520]   In the world you have tribulation, but take courage.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.880]   I have overcome the world."
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:08.920]   And finally in John chapter 17, what we know as the high priestly prayer, a prayer that
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:15.020]   was prayed for the benefit of the disciples, a prayer that the apostles probably overheard.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:21.800]   He says this in John chapter 17 verses 1 through 5, "Jesus spoke these things, and raising
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.440]   his eyes to heaven, he said, 'Father, the hour has come.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.080]   Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.800]   Just as you gave him authority over all mankind, so that to all whom you have given him, he
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.880]   may give eternal life.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.920]   And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.400]   you have sent.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.580]   I glorified you on the earth by accomplishing the work which you have given me to do.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:57.120]   And now you, Father, glorify me together with yourself, with the glory which I had with
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.760]   you before the world existed.'"
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.640]   So imagine you're the disciples here.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.760]   Imagine you're one of them.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.680]   Despite all the reassurances that Jesus is giving to his apostles, the promise of the
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.360]   Holy Spirit dwelling in them and no longer with them, the promise that they would come
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:26.280]   along but later, the promise that Jesus would come back, take them to where they were.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:35.840]   Despite all of that, if it were you and me, we would be pretty discouraged too.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.680]   They had left everything they knew to follow Jesus.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.080]   They left their entire world to follow him.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.720]   They gave up everything.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:55.680]   And upon following him these past about three years, they had witnessed the feeding of the
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.120]   masses with the child's meager portions, the curing of the nobleman's son, the hauling
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.140]   in of the great amount of fish, the casting out of unclean spirits, the healing the servants
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.960]   of Roman officials, controlling the elements.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:19.320]   They were also almost literally imbued with power at one time to go do the same.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.160]   They had felt what it was like to cast out spirits in Jesus' name.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:33.800]   They had experienced a life, a fullness of life, a robustness of life unlike any other.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.040]   And now it's seemingly crashing.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.480]   And now it is seemingly all coming to an end.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.040]   So despite the fact that Jesus told them that it was to their advantage that he would go
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:53.600]   away, you would understand why they were sorrowful.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:02.640]   But more than just understanding, we are the disciples many times, right?
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:17.560]   How many times in our own life have we felt beset, immersed in sorrow, in guilt, in sin,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:25.600]   almost nearly always because of the choices that we have made in our own very lives?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:33.560]   But then we see the absolute humility and selflessness reflected in the Son of God.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.640]   That the little amount of time that he has, just the little amount of time he has before
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.200]   his betrayal and his crucifixion, he is the one praying for his disciples.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.120]   Because the disciples check out and just go to sleep.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.040]   And what's interesting about John chapter 17 verses 13 to 20, he's praying for his disciples
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.920]   but also in that moment, he's praying for you and he's praying for me.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.560]   John chapter 17 verses 13 to 20 says this, "But now I am coming to you and these things
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.680]   I speak in the world so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.400]   I have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are not of the
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.880]   world just as I am not of the world.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.040]   I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to keep them away from the evil
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   one.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.640]   They are not of the world just as I am not of the world.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.880]   Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.720]   Your word is truth.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.280]   Just as you sent me into the world, I also send them into the world.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.160]   And for their sakes, I sanctify myself so that they themselves also may be sanctified
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   in truth."
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:50.840]   Verse 20, "I am not asking on behalf of these alone but also for those who believe in me
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.600]   through their word that they may all be one just as you, Father, are in me and I in you
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.280]   that they may also be in us so that the world may believe that you sent me."
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.600]   Oh, so the precious amount of time that he has left as he's praying, he's also thinking
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.120]   about us.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.320]   And in that way, you and I are just like the disciples.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:25.000]   And so you see, he had to go.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:36.600]   He had to be our Passover lamb because our sin required him to go.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   Satan was the one trying to stop him from going to the cross.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:47.920]   We know that because Jesus' response to Peter is, "Get behind me, Satan," after he tells
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.560]   him he's going to be killed and raised.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.680]   It is the Father sending his Son to the cross.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:06.080]   It is the Son willingly laying down his life in obedience to the Father for the joy that
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.440]   is set before him.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:21.520]   So as Passover was celebrated for hundreds of years, as Christians, we remember and relish
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:28.200]   in the fulfillment and in the substance, no longer the shadow.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.160]   And as New Testament communion is instituted for the first time during that night, now,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.600]   whenever we take communion, we also do it in obedience of our Lord and looking forward
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.240]   to God's promises in the future.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.680]   I want to end this with a quote from Charles Spurgeon on this subject.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.480]   He preached about this, and he has a quote that I really like on this subject.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:59.360]   And in the quote, he is discussing whether or not anything plus Christ washes away our
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   guilt.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:06.640]   In the quote, he is discussing anything plus Christ washes away our guilt.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:14.720]   Anything such as godless ideologies that we syncretically wed to the gospel and alleged
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.760]   good work that we wed to the gospel, right?
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:28.440]   Church association, legalism, abused grace, CRT, social justice, worship of the state,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:34.140]   Christless conservatism, anything that is wed to the gospel.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:40.140]   He says this, "You may be as righteous as you like.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.640]   If you have not the blood sprinkled, all the goodness of your doorposts and lentils will
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.040]   be of no avail whatever."
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.400]   "Yes," says another, "I am not trusting exactly there.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.880]   I believe it is my duty to be as good as I can.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.320]   But then I think Jesus Christ's mercy will make up the rest.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:05.000]   I try to be as righteous as circumstances allow, and I believe that whatever deficiencies
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   there may be, Christ will make them up."
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.200]   That is as if a Jew had said, "Child, bring me the blood."
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.680]   And then when that was brought, he had said, "Bring me some water."
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   And then he had taken it and mixed it together and sprinkled a doorpost with it.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   Why?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.760]   The angel would have smitten him as well as anyone else.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.880]   For it is blood, blood, blood, blood that saves.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.540]   It is not blood mixed with the water of our poor works.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.880]   It is blood, blood, blood, blood, and nothing else.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   And the only way of salvation is by blood.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.760]   For without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.920]   Have precious blood sprinkled upon you, my hearers.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.960]   Trust in precious blood.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:01.480]   Let your hope be in a salvation sealed with an atonement of precious blood, and you are
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   saved.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:09.920]   But having no blood or having blood mixed with anything else, thou art damned as thou
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.000]   art live, thou art alive.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.760]   For the angel shall slay thee, however good and righteous thou mayest be.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.160]   Go home then and think of this.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:29.600]   Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.080]   Let's pray.
