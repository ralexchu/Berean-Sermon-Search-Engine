[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   - All right, good morning everyone.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.320]   For once, I'm not an undergrad computer science major at UC Irvine, so I'm sorry to disappoint
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.840]   and for breaking that trend.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   Well, let's go and get started.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.360]   My name is Enoch, and to start things off, I would just like to say that growing up during
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.880]   my younger years, I absolutely hated my name.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.440]   I know there's one other Enoch somewhere in this church.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.640]   I'm not sure if he feels the same way or if he's braver than I am, who knows?
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   I might talk to him later.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.920]   But I would have countless nicknames like Enoch, Eggnog, and my personal favorite, Enush.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   Not sure where that comes from.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.840]   So as a chubby Korean 14-year-old boy, I didn't dare correct my massive ex-NFL player of a
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840]   coach.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.120]   So for three years, I was formally Enush, right, growing up.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.520]   But at least my wrestling coach got it right, so I stuck with that sport a little longer.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.240]   Anyhoo, without digressing too much, like many other Korean Americans, I grew up in
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.720]   a Presbyterian church.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   So specifically as a pastor's kid, as I got older, I really began to understand why I
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.080]   was named Enoch.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520]   However, as I previously stated, I honestly did not like my name, nor did I really want
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940]   to live up to what it really meant.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.280]   So once again, growing up, I was more afraid of people mispronouncing my name at the local
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.240]   Starbucks rather than understanding the strong Christian roots from which it was derived.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.560]   So I'm sure as you all know, there's a common stereotype that pastor's kids go one of two
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560]   ways.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.820]   They're either very good or terrible and rebellious.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.880]   So if I told you that my brother was perhaps the most innocent, mission trip volunteering,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.200]   praise leader, goody two-shoes, you can easily guess where that puts me.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.800]   So to be frank, I can truthfully admit that I was not a Christian growing up.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   Oftentimes I would catch myself leaning towards more agnostic beliefs, especially as I saw
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.640]   the sinful nature of the so-called Christians within the church.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   So to really put things into perspective, I had to ask my dad, my pastor, my father,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.360]   whether or not I was even baptized.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   So apparently within the Presbyterian church, once you're sprinkled as an infant, you eventually
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.720]   go through a confirmation process at the ripe age of 18.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   So I have zero recollection of going through that confirmation process.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.960]   So this really has to be the epitome of going through the motions to appease my parents,
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.640]   who of course I love very much and respect.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.760]   So I'm actually someone who unfortunately always learns the hard way.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.080]   And it was only until the very recent year of 2019 that I went through personal hardships
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.320]   beyond what I could have imagined, whatever happened to me.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.520]   So I've always thought of myself as tough, you know, as a tough, resilient person who
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.280]   could not really be easily broken, but I was proven very wrong.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.080]   So lying alone in the hospital bed of the emergency room on multiple occasions really
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   reminded me how fragile life can be.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.640]   And honestly, up until that point, I was extremely comfortable constantly giving in to my personal
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.320]   vices without a second thought.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.200]   So ultimately, this was due to the fact that I was never essentially penalized for my moral
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.480]   behavior, which eventually became habitual.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   And once again, ultimately, my sense of morality and faith in God quickly diminished.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.560]   So hitting rock bottom made me realize how insufficient I am on my own.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.040]   And I've since accepted Christ into my life to be my Lord and Savior.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   I was essentially able to recover by his grace, and I was healed mentally, physically, emotionally,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.240]   and spiritually by admitting my weaknesses and confessing my sins before God.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.800]   However, the primary and most important difference this time around was that I found Christ for
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.520]   myself and not solely to appease my family.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.400]   I'm very grateful to have taken the chance to come out to Bahrain Community Church.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.240]   For once, I can say that I'm surrounded by a genuine community of Christ-loving individuals.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.780]   And even after such a short time at the church, I definitely feel supported by my fellow brothers
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.520]   and sisters in Christ, as well as the excellent leadership team at this church.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.480]   I just want to thank everyone here for your patience as my walk with Christ is still relatively
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.280]   new, and I will undoubtedly stumble here and there.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.560]   So thank you for joining me today on such a huge milestone in my life, and hopefully
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.600]   this time around I can actually remember it.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Thanks.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   [applause]
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   [applause]
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   [applause]
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   [applause]
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   [applause]
