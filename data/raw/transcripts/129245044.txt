[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   So if you get done reading, again I wanted you guys to read up until the end of Chapter
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   2.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   Do you realize that the section actually goes much longer, but I stopped it there because
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.960]   it's a good stopping point.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.480]   But once you guys finish reading that, please try to write out a summary and then you guys
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.800]   can look up or...
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Okay.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   Let's see.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560]   Alright.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   So if you guys didn't get a chance to write a summary, please be in the habit of trying
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.000]   to do that when you guys read.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   Just by way of thinking through our own devotions.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.200]   It is always good to look at things in great detail and it's always good to wrap your mind
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.120]   around that detail so that you have something to take away.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.200]   Something that will last, something that you can meditate on, right?
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.220]   And writing summaries for different sections is good.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.600]   It's kind of like actually sometimes talking with somebody, you know?
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   You can be in a conversation with somebody and talk to them over coffee for about an
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.080]   hour.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.000]   Sometimes they'll say things and they're a little disconnected and you're kind of like,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.400]   what are you talking about, you know?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.600]   And you want them to kind of boil down it by saying, wait a minute, so what you're saying
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.800]   is and then you summarize it for them and we do that because we want to understand.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.700]   So likewise, get in the habit of summarizing sections and paragraphs so that you can retain
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.040]   and understand, okay?
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.080]   Now I had you guys read up to the end of chapter two for the sake of summary, but if you notice,
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.020]   if you look at chapter three, notice how he says, "And I, brethren, could not speak to
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.080]   you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ."
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Right?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.440]   So you think, okay, he's talking about now fleshliness.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.920]   So rightly in my Bible, it talks about, or it has this title heading, Foundations for
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.800]   Living, but he references again the same thing that we mentioned at the very beginning.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.160]   Look at verse four, "For when one says, I am of Paul and another, I am of Apollos, are
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.080]   you not mere men?"
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   Oh, so now he's going back to where we started.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.020]   So you realize he's been saying so much already, but actually this section continues.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.020]   So how to outline this whole thing is difficult.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.060]   From one commentary to another, the outlines are really different.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.380]   But I would again recommend you guys be observant of these things to see what is Apostle Paul's
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.260]   flow of thought, okay?
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.460]   That being the case, I want to at least summarize section by section for us, and I think verses
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.920]   10 to the end of chapter two is a good chunk.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.580]   It's pretty broad, but it's not so small that we're kind of disconnecting his thoughts.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.860]   Let me ask you guys, what are some summaries you came up with for chapters 1-10 through
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.260]   the end of chapter two?
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.460]   Any volunteers to share their summary?
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.460]   Yes.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.020]   You have sort of a long one.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.020]   That's okay.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.020]   So I guess I'll summarize the first part.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.020]   Unity is essential because of the unity of Christ and the power of the gospel through
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.020]   Christ.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.020]   The bigger part is, "God has totally upended the normal order of the world and its value
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.020]   system in order to bring glory to his name.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.020]   Now the wisdom of the world, the strength of the world, means nothing.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.020]   The wisdom of God is revealed in Christ by the Spirit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.020]   Only those he has called can use the wisdom of the Spirit of the Holy Spirit to do such
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.020]   a thing."
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.020]   So I guess I'll summarize the first part.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.020]   Unity is essential because of the unity of Christ and the power of the gospel through
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.020]   Christ.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.020]   The bigger part is, "God has totally upended the normal order of the world and its value
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.020]   system in order to bring glory to his name.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.020]   Now the wisdom of the world, the strength of the world, means nothing.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:54.020]   The wisdom of God is revealed in Christ by the Spirit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   Only those he has called can use the wisdom of the Spirit of the Holy Spirit to do such
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.020]   a thing."
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.020]   So we no longer rely on wisdom or strength of persuasion from our God.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   Nice.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.020]   Very good.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.020]   I'm just kidding.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.020]   I'm just kidding.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.340]   But there are other things to notice and other things to summarize.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.620]   So who else has another summary perhaps?
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.660]   That was really well said.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.660]   If you can boil it down.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   Yes.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.660]   Okay, do the shorter one.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660]   No divisions.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   Okay.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.660]   Great.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   Anything else you guys see?
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:29.500]   There has to be some middle ground.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.580]   Yeah, there should be some middle ground.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.500]   I'm going to call on a few people just so that, you know, to keep you on your toes.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   How's it going?
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   Dee Dee, you're looking right at me, so.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   I kind of took questions from the first six and that one.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   I think I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   I'm going to go with that one.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   - You said that you have one spirit.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   You have one heart.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   - Good, okay.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   Good.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   That was well said, too.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   Excellent.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   Okay.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   Anybody else?
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   All right.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   So, you guys can see that, obviously, perhaps, again,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   sometimes I compare how I used to think about things
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   when I first read it.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   Let's say when I was a young Christian in college
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   or whatever, and then how I'm older,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   and then how I'm more of a Christian.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   And I compare that to how I used to think about things.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.940]   in verse 18 for the word of the cross is foolishness.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.380]   And I want to ask you guys,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.320]   so from your summary and from looking at this next section
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.940]   that we're gonna be focusing on today,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.660]   verses 18 and down,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.320]   what do you think is the logical connection for him
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.180]   from going to talking about unity in their vision
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.060]   to now talking about the foolishness of the cross?
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.060]   Let's try to identify that.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.860]   Okay, so you guys get my question, right?
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.100]   He uses the word for, which is a connecting word,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   and he goes from talking about unity
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.460]   to now for the foolishness of the cross.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.440]   So the word of the cross is foolishness, okay?
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:40.500]   What would be the logical connection for him to say for,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.740]   and then he's moving into this?
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.400]   (water falling)
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:08:05.040]   Thinking about it.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.700]   (water falling)
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.360]   (water falling)
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.020]   (water falling)
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:22.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.260]   (water falling)
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:38.100]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.760]   (water falling)
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:48.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.300]   (water falling)
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.140]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.800]   (water falling)
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Okay, good, good.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.680]   Good, were you guys able to hear what he said?
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.240]   All right, good.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.060]   So thank you for sharing that.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.440]   So as you guys do your Bible studies,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.520]   be always asking questions like this.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.760]   If you actually notice, looking down at our passage,
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.680]   starting from verse 18,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.360]   he actually uses that word for a lot,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.040]   verse 18, for the word of the cross,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   and then he asks in verse 20,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.880]   where is the wise man, all this kind of stuff.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.680]   Actually, sorry, verse 18, there's for,
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.040]   verse 19, there's for, verse 20, there's the question,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.420]   verse 21, there is for, verse 22, there is for,
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.140]   and then connecting the next section,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.460]   verse 26, there's for,
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.860]   and you notice that he's really building up a case, okay?
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.380]   And so it's important for us to follow the logic.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.020]   And Matt was really getting at to the right focus
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.560]   of what he's trying to do.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.940]   He's talking about their unity and disunity,
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.980]   and he is looking at their disunity,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.040]   and seeing it's not just a disunity
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.020]   as in like a discord between two people.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.180]   He's looking at their strife,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.580]   and he's looking at their, you know,
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.980]   the factions that they have,
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.740]   and the dissensions that they have,
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.700]   and he's not just saying,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.700]   hey, it's just relational problems,
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.420]   we can get through this.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.620]   He's seeing it as a much bigger category, right?
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.620]   And so Matt was right.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.620]   In seeing their disunity,
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.800]   he was pointing to the fact that there is already then
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.620]   a contrast between worldly wisdom and God's wisdom.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.780]   There is then an existence of a bigger,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.140]   I guess something bigger at stake,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.560]   which is their understanding of what is at the core
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.780]   of who they are, the gospel of Jesus Christ, right?
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.220]   And so he is making a plea through this,
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.100]   he's making a plea through this,
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.860]   to say don't be misled by worldly wisdom,
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.540]   but come back to the core of the gospel, okay?
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.980]   Now, I mentioned for you,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:10.460]   that, or I guess in your packet,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.300]   that verse, verse 18,
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.660]   for the wisdom of the cross,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.740]   sorry, for the word of the cross is foolishness
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.900]   to those who are perishing,
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.820]   but to us who are being saved,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.700]   it is the power of God.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.300]   That is like a proposition statement
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.140]   of the whole paragraph or thought
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.100]   from verse 18 through 25, okay?
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.420]   So think of that as your proposition.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.440]   That is a great verse to memorize.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.880]   A great verse to memorize, okay?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.920]   Because it's giving us the spiritual position
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   or the spiritual principle that he sees working in them
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.460]   when they are disunited, okay?
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.640]   So, I wanna ask you a question here.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.240]   Just from this one verse,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.440]   what kinds of spiritual realities
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.860]   can you deduce from verse 18?
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.620]   (silence)
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.760]   Well, Matt already mentioned,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.800]   like the world sees the cross as foolishness.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.820]   That's the reality, okay?
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.840]   Sometimes we hope, right,
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.140]   that it wasn't so foolish when we go evangelize.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.680]   We wish it wasn't so laughable.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.500]   We wish it wasn't so offensive,
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.000]   but that's the spiritual reality we have to accept, right?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.900]   But what else can you deduce from that?
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:39.440]   (audience member speaking)
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   Good, okay.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.360]   So there's, you know, that the spiritual truth
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.780]   of our destiny, whether we're going to heaven or hell,
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.220]   relies upon saving knowledge.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.700]   Does that kinda summarize what you're saying?
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.660]   What else?
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.660]   (silence)
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:13.460]   Okay, things of God are foolishness
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.900]   to the eyes of the world.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:21.500]   You notice also how it's talking about, you know,
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.900]   in terms of those who are perishing
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.940]   and those who are being saved.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.100]   You see how it kinda spiritual reality
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.500]   of the current condition, so to speak,
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.100]   that what God is doing currently.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.560]   So anyway, this verse is one
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.860]   that's really good to memorize, okay?
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.340]   Now I wanna move forward and lay out for you
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.980]   the rest of the paragraph in this way,
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.980]   'cause I think there's more structure to be seen
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.860]   than kinda meets the eye.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860]   Just for your blank there, the logical layout
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.260]   of the passage from verse 18 to 25,
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.180]   because I noticed that there was this repetition
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.300]   of the word for, and for me then,
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.260]   I had a way to kinda outline the passage for me.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.620]   For could mean, yes, you know, like,
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.140]   for something, as in this is for the purpose of,
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.740]   or intent, or goal.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.540]   For could mean kinda suitability or fitness.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.940]   So I think I have blanks for you there.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.940]   This is just, I'm gonna go through it quickly, okay?
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.020]   So the first one was, for could mean purpose.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.460]   Second one, for could mean suitability,
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.740]   like, hey, this is not for you to decide,
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.300]   or this is not for you to know.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.780]   But as you guys know, for could also mean because.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.540]   This is the reason, right?
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.020]   And I think that's what Apostle Paul is doing.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.660]   So what is his main point is he's showing
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.660]   the superiority, or at least the crucialness,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.980]   importance of the gospel, right,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.740]   which is the wisdom of God.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.260]   So if you guys can, in that little blank,
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.420]   this is the way I would like to write it.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.700]   Reasons why God's wisdom is superior, okay?
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.860]   So let me repeat that.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.900]   Reasons why God's wisdom is superior,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.160]   as a layout of the passage from verse 18 through 25, okay?
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.460]   Okay.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   So, I'm gonna read to us verse 19 and 20,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.780]   and we're gonna observe the first reason.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.940]   And we're gonna observe it by way of just kinda, again,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.860]   asking questions of what's taking place.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.700]   So Apostle Paul has said, I look at your dissension,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.440]   I see not only just relational problems,
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.940]   but I see a division of the way that you're thinking.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.580]   You are thinking according to worldly wisdom.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.140]   And then, in describing it, he says,
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.540]   basically the foolishness, or the cross is foolishness
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.580]   to those who are perishing,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.700]   but to those who are being saved is the power of God.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.320]   And he's going to lay down a case
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.300]   as to why the power of God, the wisdom of God, is greater.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.500]   Verse 19 says, for it is written,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.900]   so I'm taking that for as to say because it is written,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.820]   I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.120]   and the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.220]   Where is the wise man, where is the scribe,
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.780]   where is the debater of this age?
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.100]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.740]   My first question to you is, as we observe verse 19,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.900]   what is God's attitude towards the wisdom of the world?
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:27.000]   In verse 19, when you read that,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.160]   what is God's attitude towards the wisdom of the world?
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.800]   He what?
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.060]   He despises it.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.720]   Now, what's really interesting about that is this,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.640]   is as we know God to be a kind God,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.320]   wouldn't he be one where he wants people
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.040]   to exercise their discernment?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.440]   And wouldn't he want them to exercise critical thinking
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.600]   and analysis and to exercise the use of their brain?
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.480]   Well, yes.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.960]   But what is he saying there?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.340]   That he's going to destroy the wisdom of the wise
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.840]   and the wisdom of the world
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.400]   and all the wisdom of the clever ones,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.280]   he's gonna lay aside.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.760]   What's even more interesting about this
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.840]   is that this quotation comes from Isaiah chapter 29,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.040]   verse 14.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:16.880]   You don't have to turn there,
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.720]   I'm just gonna tell you a quick story, okay?
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.320]   Isaiah is prophesying in a time, obviously,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.780]   when the nation of Israel is not doing well.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.160]   The northern kingdom is constantly under threat
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.200]   by the Assyrians of being destroyed, okay?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.740]   Remember, the Assyrians are a nasty group, pagan group,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.200]   and they ultimately destroy the northern kingdom.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.720]   Well, Sennacherib, who is the king of Assyria,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.200]   is threatening Israel and saying,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.520]   "I'm gonna destroy you, I'm gonna destroy you."
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.800]   And Isaiah gives a prophecy from the Lord
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.860]   telling the people, "Don't worry about it.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.760]   "They're not gonna win.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.700]   "They're gonna fail, they're gonna fail miserably."
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.680]   But what's really interesting about the whole story
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.200]   is this, is God makes sure to tell Hezekiah,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.000]   through Isaiah, you are not going to win
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.060]   and they're not going to fail because you're strong.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.560]   You're not going to win because you have lots of advisors.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.480]   You're not gonna win because you are clever,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.840]   but you are going to win because I am with you.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.000]   And so the story goes, over 180,000 men
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.800]   of Sennacherib, the Assyrians, get destroyed,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.120]   not by the people, but by one angel, okay?
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.920]   The reason why I say that's really interesting
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.620]   is because God is making a point to them
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.880]   that they're not going to be successful
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.400]   based on their wisdom, but He's telling that
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   to His own people, right?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.160]   He wasn't necessarily speaking and addressing Sennacherib.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.840]   He was addressing Hezekiah.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.000]   And if you know Hezekiah, he was a good king,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.980]   but at the tail end of his life, he fell to his pride.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.640]   He fell to his pride.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.440]   And so here, what we have, again, is this thought for us.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.260]   When we try to apply our own wisdom,
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.600]   our own understanding, to scenarios and situations,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.320]   that's fine, so long as it's what?
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.240]   According to the Lord's wisdom.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.600]   And as soon as our wisdom, our cleverness,
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.240]   is placed above, placed priority over God's,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.900]   it's not as if God says, "Well, good try,
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.280]   "but here's what I would have to say to that."
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.140]   God says, "No, not only is it not acceptable,
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.520]   "I am going to destroy whatever you place above my wisdom."
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.480]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.680]   From the Bible stories that you guys know,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.320]   whether it be Old Testament stories or New Testament stories,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.160]   what are some scenarios where people apply
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.440]   their understanding, their wisdom, their ingenuity,
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.600]   for whatever success or goal they wanted?
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.520]   What are some biblical examples of people going outside
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.640]   of what God was trying to do to accomplish their ends?
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.480]   There's a lot.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.240]   Just think about it for a moment.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.400]   (silence)
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.960]   Abraham and Sarah.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.360]   I don't have a baby, I'm getting old, so?
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.160]   He's gonna go use one of his servants.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.720]   And then, you know, the story goes
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.960]   that there's strife then in the family,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.560]   there's all this and that.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.400]   What else?
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.080]   (audience member speaks)
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   Yeah, Peter, he's got a lot of moments, like in the Bible.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.720]   Where he's like, Jesus is like, ah, you're not shaking his.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.800]   There's a lot of moments like that.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.360]   What other examples are there?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.440]   Okay, are Isaac and Rebecca?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:55.000]   Right, oh, Rebecca, okay, I got you guys.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.520]   Rebecca and Jacob, where Rebecca is trying to fool Isaac
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.280]   by dressing her son up as Esau and making him all hairy.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.320]   And he's all worried, like, I'm smooth, though.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.920]   I don't have hair.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.080]   And so the mom is thinking, like, just trust me, son,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.120]   like a good Asian mom.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.040]   And then he's like, it forces him to do all this stuff.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.580]   And yeah, and what does that end up in?
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.920]   Now there's family strife, now Esau hates him.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.880]   And Esau is sitting there saying,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.480]   when Isaac gets old enough and dies,
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.460]   I'm gonna go kill you.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.080]   And then, you know, they're at odds and all that stuff.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.340]   And he's known as a deceiver.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.800]   What other stories are there?
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.120]   - Esau would be an offended, often sacrificed,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.320]   and was regarded as a hating person.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.120]   And as a victim of his own.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.420]   - Right, right.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.240]   You know, it was forbidden.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.000]   That role of the priesthood was only appointed by God.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.120]   And Esau, because he wanted to make sure he has a blessing
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.400]   before he goes into a fight, decides,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.760]   well, Samuel's coming late,
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.880]   so I'm just gonna go ahead and do it, you know?
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.080]   And that ends up, again,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.440]   actually, it's a pretty intense moment
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.280]   where Samuel starts to say,
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.560]   and the Lord has rejected you, you know?
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.500]   So, great example.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.160]   Above these and more, we realize,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.960]   what's really interesting about this scenario
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.640]   and all the examples you gave,
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.280]   a lot of those examples,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.880]   it wasn't like the people were trying to accomplish
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.240]   an end that was like completely,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.000]   completely contrary to God, right?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.720]   Like, did God wanna bless Jacob?
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.740]   Yes.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.480]   Did God wanna provide Saul,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.440]   like, victory in war?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.640]   Yes.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.160]   It was kind of strange to think about,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.080]   these are God's people,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.800]   but what ends up happening is,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.720]   they apply their own cleverness and wisdom.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.000]   And in so doing, it's almost as though
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   they were pursuing a completely different ends than God was.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.480]   And so we realize, from passages like this,
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.680]   that even for us, when we think about our lives,
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.940]   when we think about situations and circumstances,
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.820]   yes, are we supposed to apply discernment and wisdom
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.660]   and careful thinking and intentionality?
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.560]   Absolutely.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.180]   But we have to make sure that we never cross that boundary,
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.400]   we never cross that line,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.180]   where we all of a sudden apply our ingenuity,
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.420]   and we decide, well,
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.940]   this is the only way it's going to succeed.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.900]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.300]   And whether it's a silly goal like,
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.900]   I just wanna date somebody,
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.620]   and I wanna, you know,
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.000]   like, it's beneficial to have a family.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.900]   Well, great.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.460]   Do I think that's the Lord's will
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.540]   for the vast majority of the people in this age?
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.880]   I do.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.020]   But when people start thinking,
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.980]   well, I'm gonna try out this Buddhist guy,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.000]   and I'm gonna try out this, you know, Catholic girl,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.540]   and all of a sudden, your wisdom takes over,
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.980]   then you're absolutely wrong.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.060]   Whether it's your job, whether it's your school,
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.180]   whether it's your family life,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.060]   if you start to think,
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.500]   well, I know this is what the Lord says,
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.580]   but in order for this end to happen,
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.380]   I have to do X, Y, and Z.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.500]   Now, all of a sudden, it's the same as,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.820]   you're completely, completely overriding God,
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.380]   and you're designed to pursue an end
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.540]   that the Lord will not bless.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.940]   Okay?
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.220]   So, one of the things I want you to jot down is this.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.180]   For verse 19, part A,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:15.240]   an interesting truth, a principle we have to realize is,
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.820]   God's wisdom is exclusive.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.380]   You don't say, okay, I understand God's wisdom,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.840]   and I'm just gonna apply mine on top of that, no.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.540]   God says, it's God's wisdom, it's God's way,
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.660]   it's God's methodology,
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.180]   and the wisdom of the world,
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.560]   is he gonna be like, good try?
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.440]   No, he says, I'm going to destroy.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.340]   God's wisdom is exclusive.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:47.460]   But part B, we observe, he starts asking these questions,
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.980]   and I wanna ask you,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.380]   when he asks these questions of like,
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.460]   where is the wise man, where is the scribe,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.980]   where is the debater of this age,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.540]   has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.560]   Through these questions, what truth is he trying to conclude?
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:17.820]   Through these questions, what truth is he trying to
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.660]   conclude?
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:38.200]   Just try, you guys, you know.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   I'm not gonna be like, I will destroy your,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.220]   (laughs)
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.900]   For me, I'm gonna say, good try.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.940]   It's fine, and a lot of times,
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.460]   the things that you guys say are really insightful.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.980]   Excellent.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.940]   They're not to be seen.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.860]   And so what we realize is, where are they?
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.500]   They're not here.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.660]   And so the principle that I see is,
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.180]   the wisdom of the world, the debaters of the age,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.740]   the scribes of the day, guess what?
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.300]   They are temporary.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.500]   And so by contrast, God's wisdom is what?
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.340]   Permanent.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.500]   And so, I left a big blank for you guys.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.660]   The reason why God's wisdom is so much more powerful,
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.420]   the reason why it's so much more superior,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.060]   the reason number one is because it's exclusively permanent.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.060]   And nothing else is.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.660]   Nothing else lasts generations upon generations
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.140]   for ages upon ages.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.540]   Nothing else lasts forever, like God would say.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.080]   That out of the grass of the field
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.180]   and all the stuff would wither,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.660]   his word, what?
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.260]   Lasts forever.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.780]   God's word, his truth is exclusively permanent.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.700]   And so that's what he asked.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.020]   He was like, where are they?
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.620]   What have they become?
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.740]   And I wanna take a moment to say,
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.820]   you know, the things that I think are so,
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.580]   you know, people would try to elevate
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.460]   as to be so wise and so academic, so to speak?
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.300]   What have that concluded?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.820]   See, for me, I was a philosophy major.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.740]   I feel like it was a really bad decision in my life.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.700]   Now, I did learn how to read better
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.300]   'cause my reading was horrible.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.620]   And I did learn how to write better
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.140]   'cause my writing was also horrible,
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.820]   as you guys sometimes see in your packet.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.740]   So at least I gained skill.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.620]   But it did confuse me a lot
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.540]   because I started learning about things like metaphysics.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.020]   You know, metaphysics, you know,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.140]   just actually to start even broader than that,
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.740]   philosophy is a love of wisdom.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.940]   Philosophy is questioning all these various things.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.780]   What's your destiny?
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.900]   What's the value system?
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.740]   What's your knowledge?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.020]   How do you know things?
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.700]   Epistemology, that's the study of like your knowledge
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.940]   and the gaining of truth.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.580]   And then I started learning the metaphysical stuff,
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.500]   talking about beyond physics,
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.660]   transcending the stuff of being, you know?
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.260]   And then you come out like,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.260]   what do I know and what do I don't know?
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.100]   What do I not know?
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.580]   And it's just an interesting thing.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.380]   But what's the fruit of all that?
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.900]   Has that caused me to be a more moral and upright man?
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.500]   Has that caused me to be more disciplined?
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.660]   Has that caused me to be more godly?
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.620]   Has that caused me to love people more?
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:17.660]   And then, you know, I realized there are certain areas
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.340]   where we should always excel in learning.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.180]   We should excel in learning God's creation.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.780]   We should excel in learning, you know, who we are.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.380]   We should excel in learning truth.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.580]   But there are things that really,
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.780]   you just keep learning and learning,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.660]   it just has no fruit.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.420]   And for me, as, you know, someone who went to seminary,
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.580]   I considered, do I go to, you know, get a PhD in this?
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.460]   And I'm gonna just throw out a couple things for you guys.
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.580]   Right now, what's huge is redaction theory
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.460]   and source theory.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.700]   You know what that is?
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.420]   It's a bunch of PhDs sitting together,
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.820]   wondering what's the source of the Bible?
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.100]   Did they have common sources?
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.060]   Did they have certain people?
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.740]   And so they'll look at the book of Deuteronomy
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.620]   and say maybe it had a, you know, a priestly source
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.700]   that they all kind of corporately got,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.860]   like, their resources from?
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.340]   Or did they piece together different mythologies
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.340]   from their generation and age?
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.300]   So they're sitting there learning and learning
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.620]   and studying, and I'm gonna tell you honestly,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.940]   if you go into the Christian academic world,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.500]   if you don't understand that, they look at you as stupid.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.380]   And they're like, oh, you don't know the broader discussion
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.260]   of what's going on in academic Christianity.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.180]   And I'm sitting there looking at them like,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.340]   if you're gonna call me stupid
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.640]   'cause I don't trust my Bible, call me stupid.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.500]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.380]   Like, I'm sitting here asking them, like,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.660]   so you're gonna get your PhD,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.940]   you're gonna learn for like five, six years,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.540]   and at the end of it, you're just gonna doubt the Bible.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.940]   What's the fruit of all that?
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.180]   Seriously, it's this question of, like,
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.620]   when you apply worldly wisdom,
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.680]   where are you at the end of this?
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.460]   There's no godly wisdom, you have no knowledge of God.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.860]   And so I see a vain pursuit of earthly wisdom,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   vain pursuit of new ideas and new systems and new theories.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.420]   I'm not saying all academia is bad.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.940]   As a matter of fact, we've advanced a lot
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.420]   in different fields of study,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.180]   and I think it's awesome, you know?
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.300]   But you have to realize there is a question in all that is,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.660]   a lot of that is temporary.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.860]   And I wanna say to you guys, just as Apostle Paul
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.060]   is looking at the church saying,
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.900]   you guys have to be wise, you guys have to be discerning,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.660]   because there's so many pull, there's so much luring you
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.920]   to apply worldly wisdom to your circumstances, right?
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.660]   Like, case in point, you know,
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.160]   lately I'm doing a lot of counseling
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.300]   for different scenarios in your life.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.980]   How to, again, how to choose spouse,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.420]   how to choose jobs, what to do in certain circumstances,
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.820]   how to deal with personal struggle,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.180]   how to deal with emotional struggle,
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.260]   how to deal with all of this.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.340]   And to tell you honestly,
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.880]   in every one of those circumstances,
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.340]   there is either a worldly philosophy to apply,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.820]   or there is a biblical godly philosophy to apply.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.940]   And Apostle Paul is challenging them
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.060]   to be discerning enough to see
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.460]   that God's wisdom is stronger,
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:07.180]   God's wisdom is more, or is superior, okay?
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.840]   I have some verses for you here.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   There is a way which seems right to a man,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.200]   but its end is the way of death.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.040]   He says in verse Isaiah chapter 19,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.420]   well then, where are your wise men?
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.920]   Please let them tell you, and let them understand
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.360]   what the Lord of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.120]   The princess of Zion has acted foolishly,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.920]   the princes of Memphis are deluded.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.040]   Those who are the cornerstone of her tribes
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.880]   have led Egypt astray.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.700]   The Lord has mixed within her a spirit of distortion
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.780]   that have led Egypt astray,
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.660]   and all that it does,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.020]   as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:43.240]   That's how God sees the counselors of Egypt.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.540]   You know, the scribes of Egypt.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.260]   That's how God sees them.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:53.020]   So again, just kind of summarizing that point though,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.820]   he's again pitting against worldly wisdom and godly wisdom.
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.160]   And he's saying godly wisdom is exclusively permanent.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.560]   The rest, look at their fruit.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.600]   Where are they?
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.440]   Okay?
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.760]   Oh, it's already eight.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.080]   Hmm, okay.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.020]   Moving forward to verse 21.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:18.020]   I'm gonna smash together then verse 21 and 22.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.560]   He says, for since in the wisdom of God,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.680]   the world through its wisdom did not come to know God.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.820]   God was well pleased through the foolishness
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.140]   of the message preached to save those who believe.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.160]   For indeed, Jews ask for signs,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.860]   and Greeks search for wisdom.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.180]   But we preach Christ crucified to Jews a stumbling block
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.860]   into the Gentiles' foolishness.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.420]   Okay?
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.740]   So, in this, there's another reason to be observed.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.700]   And you look at what's being said here,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.140]   and then in verse 21, part A,
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.860]   he says, for since in the wisdom of God,
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.900]   the world through its wisdom did not come to know God.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.300]   And I ask you this question,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.060]   which is a pretty profound question
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.780]   in my studies of apologetics, okay?
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.340]   I read different theories of apologetics.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.500]   There's what's called a classical apologetic.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.340]   There's a presuppositional apologetic.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.840]   And that's another field that you guys
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.180]   can study in your own time.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.220]   And this question really struck out a core
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.780]   of why the different philosophies of apologetics existed.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.520]   Can a man from his natural state know God?
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.620]   Can they?
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.780]   What do you guys think?
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:31.020]   Yes, no, maybe so, I don't know.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.100]   (laughs)
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:48.820]   (laughs)
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.460]   I'm just gonna let you keep going.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.020]   (laughs)
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.260]   Good, good, Romans chapter one and two has a lot to say.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.340]   It does say that they are without excuse for,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.280]   you know, through creation,
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.140]   the things that are to be known about God are known,
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.820]   his vast power, all that kind of stuff.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.500]   And through the testimony that's in our heart,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.580]   men are able to come to a point in which
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.340]   they recognize that there is God.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.560]   And so that's why they're absolutely without excuse, okay?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.800]   But there exists this question,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.920]   and obviously this verse is kind of like,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.280]   Pastor Mark, I think the verse kind of says it.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.600]   (laughs)
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.480]   It says, no, it cannot come to a knowledge of God.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.000]   Well, what's really interesting to me about this is,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   he mentions that according to the desire of God,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.760]   God, it was well pleasing to God,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.040]   that through the foolishness of the message preached
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.720]   to save the people, and so on the flip side,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.000]   it was pleasing to God, this wasn't God's plan and design,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.480]   that a man will not sit and reason
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.800]   and then start climbing the ladder to the Lord.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.760]   You see what that's saying?
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.040]   And so to answer that question,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.320]   in many sense, the answer is no.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.680]   You can deduce that there exists a higher being,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.440]   you can deduce that you are small.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.800]   You can understand that you are this tiny,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.720]   minuscule little thing in the vast array
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.800]   of all the universe, but you cannot come to a knowledge
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.360]   to understand God and have a relationship with the Lord.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.320]   And so, on the flip side of that,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   we understand, verse 21, God is limitless.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.880]   Whereas the world is so limited,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.120]   so what if somebody can study all their life,
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.960]   so what if somebody has observed the world,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.600]   so what if somebody can really kind of pinpoint
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.240]   how things function on earth,
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.440]   and they can pinpoint how people function,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.560]   and maybe they're the master at understanding
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.760]   and diagnosing people?
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.200]   But what is the end of all that
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.760]   when an individual gains knowledge but has no power,
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.520]   whereas God, he does as is well-pleasing to him?
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   He sets the criteria, he sets the agenda,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.960]   he sets what is necessary of man.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.880]   And so, for me, this passage,
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.080]   why is it that God's wisdom is so superior
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.160]   is because reason number two,
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.560]   God's wisdom is limitlessly powerful.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.600]   Limitlessly powerful.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.880]   I think that's what he's getting at.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.960]   In the wisdom of man, it could not know God, restricted.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.520]   But God, in his wisdom, does as he pleased.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.360]   That's his power, unrestricted, right?
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.080]   And so, as we think about that,
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.520]   there is our second reason as to why
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.600]   Apostle Paul is making this case
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.840]   that God's wisdom is superior.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.200]   And then in verse 22, it says,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.120]   for indeed, Jews ask for signs,
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.520]   and Greeks search for wisdom,
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.960]   but we preach Christ crucified to Jews a stumbling block
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.300]   and to the Gentiles foolishness.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.080]   What I'm actually gonna do is try to squeeze
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.680]   verse 22 through 24 all together, you guys.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.520]   So let me read it in kind of unison here, okay?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.420]   So again, Jews seek for signs, Greeks seek for wisdom,
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.680]   for the Jews a stumbling block,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   Gentiles foolishness, verse 23,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.440]   but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.320]   Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.880]   Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.040]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.480]   So what he does is he used two bookends.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.840]   At the very beginning, this is the power of God.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.480]   That's verse 24.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.720]   Oh, wait, hold on.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.260]   That's verse 25, sorry.
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.960]   Verse 25, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.720]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.800]   So essentially, this whole paragraph,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.000]   again, the main theme is God's wisdom is greater.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.520]   Now, in thinking through the middle part of it,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   I wanna hit upon just a convicting portion for all of us.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.900]   Okay, a convicting portion for all of us.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:04.700]   I asked this question in verse 22,
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.640]   why do the Jews keep seeking signs?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.400]   What sort of signs are they seeking?
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   These are all good questions to ask, right?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.640]   And for the Greeks, why are they keep seeking wisdom
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.240]   and what kind of wisdom are they seeking?
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.440]   Now, remember, Jews seek a sign, right?
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.080]   Jews seek a sign.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.920]   And all throughout various moments in history,
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.600]   when they're interacting with God
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.640]   and when they're interacting with Jesus,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.600]   they were always seeking a sign.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.040]   But the thing about it is, God gave them signs.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.600]   Remember God miraculously healed people?
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.440]   He miraculously raised people from the dead?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.000]   He miraculously caused coins
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.640]   to come out of the fish's mouth?
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.960]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.560]   even in an instance when Jesus healed the blindness
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.600]   of a man and then he sent them,
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.040]   and he sent the man away,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.160]   that man went back to his hometown
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.680]   and he was praising the Lord
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.080]   and he showed himself to people.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.040]   Look, I was blind from birth, but look at me.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.280]   That's John chapter nine, right?
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.840]   The response of the Jewish community,
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.880]   did they believe because they saw a sign?
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.200]   No, right?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.280]   No, they did not.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.560]   And so, there's a sense in which you think about it,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.440]   they're seeking a sign,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.360]   but what kind of sign are they looking for?
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.400]   They're definitely not seeking a sign that God would give.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.800]   They're seeking a sign in which would satisfy
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.840]   their own heart's desire.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.200]   The sign they wanted was triumph and victory.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.440]   The sign they wanted was overthrow
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.760]   the oppressive government of Rome.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.680]   What the sign they wanted was rulership
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.400]   and superiority of Israel.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.360]   Likewise, the Greeks are the same thing.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.560]   Did they not receive wisdom?
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.360]   Did Apostle Paul not reason with them?
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.160]   Did Apostle Paul not reveal to them?
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.320]   Did Apostle Paul not preach to them?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.040]   Was he not at the street corner?
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.440]   Was he not at the temples,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.040]   standing and preaching all day long?
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.120]   The fact of the matter is,
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   the reason why he denounces the wisdom of man,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.160]   oh shoot, sorry,
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.320]   is because the wisdom of man is not really wisdom, is it?
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.040]   It's just fleshly.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.000]   It's just seeking after the heart's desire.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.040]   It's just seeking after the things they want in the moment.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.440]   It's just seeking after their ends.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.680]   And so although they say, yes, I want a sign,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.840]   great God signs, that's not really what they wanted.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.280]   Yes, oh, I want wisdom, I want knowledge and revelation,
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.320]   that's not really what they wanted either.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.560]   And so later on in the book,
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.760]   Apostle Paul's gonna talk about that.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.880]   Part of the reason why your dissension
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.280]   and your disunity exists
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.640]   is because underneath all this pride and arrogance
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.800]   and underneath all this wisdom
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.520]   and calling out Paul as my teacher
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.840]   and Paul as my teacher,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.360]   there is something more base and fleshly.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.240]   That's a convicting thing for us, isn't it?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:09.640]   When we think about the practice of our wisdom,
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.240]   our ingenuity, our cleverness that I mentioned earlier,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.920]   you dig deeper down into why we pursue those things,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.080]   why we apply those things
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.920]   into our lives and life circumstances,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   is it's not sometimes more deeply rooted
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.080]   in simple fleshly desires,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.800]   things that our hearts have attached to.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   And so, again, coming back to just conclude,
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.320]   in a moment of division,
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.800]   in a moment when the church is kind of
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.560]   in a pretty pinnacle moment,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.600]   a crucial moment when they need to set their eyes straight,
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.960]   Apostle Paul is addressing,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.440]   yes, there are relational issues
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.280]   where you guys are in strife with each other,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.520]   but he extrapolates out and says,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.800]   there is a spiritual issue
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.320]   where you guys aren't connected with true spiritual truth,
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.400]   where you guys aren't really thinking in biblical wisdom,
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.320]   but he is also going to address,
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.880]   even underneath that,
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   there is a division in which your heart
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.800]   is seeking after that which God has not blessed.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.000]   All right, well, I hope again,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.720]   you guys will continue just kind of study,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.800]   or not kind of, but continue studying the passage in context,
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.200]   but I did wanna leave you guys
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.840]   with some discussion questions and thoughts for yourselves.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   And, oh man, can you read for me question number one?
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.960]   I forgot to write it down on my own notes.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.800]   - What examples are there
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.880]   in respect to biblical wisdom and human wisdom?
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.440]   - Okay, now, when I say examples,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.360]   you guys can address examples
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.920]   that are more broad, philosophical system,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.040]   practices of the church at large, mainstream Christianity,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.800]   okay, or practices that you see in more personal lives.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   Question number two.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.080]   Yeah, Chris, sorry.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.800]   - Are there things that you want God to put you in charge of?
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.040]   - Okay, I did want you guys to ask more personal questions.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.400]   So, there are times in which life circumstances,
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.040]   or wherever you find yourselves,
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.000]   you want to make good, wise decisions,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.480]   but it's really hard.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.720]   And sometimes, you expect God to show himself,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.040]   to prove his wisdom, to show his way before you act.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.640]   Are there things like that in your life?
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.040]   Are there things where you want God to prove himself,
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.640]   or prove that this is going to work first,
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.760]   before you actually follow?
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.960]   Last question, Eugene, can you read that for us?
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.200]   Okay.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.400]   In this talk, it was pretty general, okay?
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.960]   In this talk, it was talking about
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.360]   pitting against worldly wisdom and biblical wisdom.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.000]   But what would constitute worldly wisdom?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.760]   If I sit down and do a pro/con chart,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.480]   is that worldly wisdom?
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.120]   If I sit down and ask one of you guys for advice
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.560]   on what to do in my life circumstances,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   is that worldly wisdom?
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.080]   Because you don't happen to be the Bible.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.320]   What would classify as worldly wisdom?
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.160]   Like, to what contents, you know?
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.600]   So again, please talk about those things
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.160]   to make it a little bit more specific, okay?
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.040]   All right, let's pray and wrap up,
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.400]   and you guys can get into your discussion groups.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.920]   Heavenly Father, God, I do pray
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.400]   that every single one of us would learn to think
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.520]   more and more biblically, day by day.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.680]   God, from both learning your scriptures
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.080]   and taking it into our minds and our hearts,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.680]   help us to know that,
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.640]   but also help us to know experientially,
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.560]   to see the power of your truth.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.600]   God, that in moments where there's a decision to be made,
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.600]   we would always lean on the scriptures
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.200]   and practice it.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.360]   For the Bible itself says that we are able to discern
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.800]   what is good and what is right
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.440]   based on our practice of godliness.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.200]   So I pray, Father, that you would, again,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.000]   help us to know these things,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.040]   both from the scriptural propositions,
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.520]   but also from applying them in our lives.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.240]   God, I pray, Lord, that as Apostle Paul
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.440]   is rebuking the early church,
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.480]   rebuking them of arrogance and pride
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.360]   and exercising their own will above God's,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.200]   I pray, Lord, that we would avoid
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.680]   the examples we listed earlier,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.520]   where although you wanted to bless,
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.560]   the people had to have it their own way
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.640]   and they had to have it now.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.080]   I pray, Father God, that we would exercise great control
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.360]   so that, Lord, we would always be following
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.880]   your spirit's lead.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.600]   God, I pray for our time of discussion.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.080]   Pray that it would be fruitful.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.720]   I also pray, Father God, that we'd be able
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.760]   to make applications into our own specific life scenarios.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.660]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
