[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I don't have a recollection of that at all.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.640]   Well, as you guys--since you guys are all here, you guys know all the stuff that transpired
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.260]   over the last few days.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.760]   And you also have been aware that the theme is on drifting.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880]   So it's not like a easy theme.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.680]   We're not talking about like joy or peace or loving each other or like just true fellowship.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.500]   We're talking about some serious stuff.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.400]   We're talking about your souls.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:48.960]   And I think ultimately what I wanted for our group to get out of it really was rest.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.160]   To sort through all of the noisy clutter and all of the distractions to come together,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.080]   to look into His Word, to be challenged by His Word and at the same time uplifted by
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.440]   His Word and just to find rest.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   There's no pastor who can give you rest.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.120]   There's no great praise music that can give you rest.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.560]   There's no amount of fellowship that can give you rest.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.680]   The rest really comes from just communing with the Lord.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   Amen?
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.120]   And location doesn't matter.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.400]   I would have preferred to have been in Idyllwild.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.480]   My kids cried because we couldn't go play with the snow.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.200]   And then they kept looking at the street and they're like, "Why did the mountain break?"
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.640]   and stuff.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.360]   So they're sad.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   And I was sad that they were sad.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.680]   But it is what it is.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.040]   And one thing that I--and I'm used to change.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.320]   You know, I was on 70 flights a year from 2012 to 2018.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.160]   And a lot of times when you take 20, 30 strangers to different countries, a lot of things don't
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.920]   go the way you planned.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.720]   And so you just roll with the punches and move.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.720]   But the more obstacles that are in the way of a work of God, usually there are bigger
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   blessings attached.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.200]   And so last night I was actually here up on the stage around 11 o'clock just praying.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.480]   I had no idea we'd be here just last night.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600]   But I was just praying that God would give us a time of rest.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.040]   And so I'm hoping to do that.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   Tonight's topic is not restful.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   Tonight's topic is actually one that will cause us to struggle.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.600]   Even the holiest of people will look at it and wrestle.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   And so fortunately the messages don't end tonight.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   But tonight is going to be mostly about drifting.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   And that is not a pleasant topic.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.280]   So if you guys have your Bibles, turn to Matthew 7 and then we'll pray.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:06.440]   We'll ask the Lord's blessing and then we'll start our session one.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.720]   Matthew 7, we're going to read verses 13 and onward.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.560]   But before we do that, let's just pray to the Lord for just His guidance at this time.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.320]   The Father, we pray that you would help us to understand your heart for us, your love
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.960]   for us, that you, God, gave your only begotten Son, that we would have eternal life.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.480]   And eternal life, we know, Lord, is not about a place, but it is about a person.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.680]   It's about a relationship.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.320]   And God, we get so entangled with the things of this world that we lose sight of our purpose.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.400]   So we pray that tonight that you would start just the work of resuscitation for those of
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   us who are struggling, that you would start genuine repentance and worship in our hearts
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.840]   and be reminded of our identity in Christ.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.120]   Protect this pulpit.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   Protect our hearts.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.440]   We pray that you would help us not to be sleepy even, but to be fully engaged in your Word.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.000]   We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Amen.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.400]   I didn't pick the theme.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.800]   If you don't like the theme, you have your BAM inReach team and core members to thank
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   for it.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.160]   But our theme is drifting, the dangers of drifting.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.520]   And when they first told me that this was a theme, I actually was glad that we're starting
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.000]   with this because there are real dangers, and you guys are all very aware that there
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.840]   are dangers in your life.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.320]   And I don't even have to go into the various things that compete for your heart's affections.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.000]   But the theme comes from Hebrews 2 to 1, or 2 chapter 2, verse 1, about how we need to
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.820]   take care that we don't drift.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.560]   And we're going to be looking at this tonight and tomorrow.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.160]   Coincidentally, you guys know that Pastor Peter started a series on the book of Hebrews,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   right?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.800]   And in the last two sermons, he actually brought up the dangers of drifting.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.400]   And he said, "We never drift toward what?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Who?
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.560]   We never drift towards God.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.320]   We always kind of drift away."
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.800]   So he emphasized this.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.760]   And for you and me living here in Orange County, drifting is a very real and present danger.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.560]   And so, like I said, we didn't necessarily intend for all of this timing to be put together
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.200]   like this, but I am very thankful because it will cause us to kind of focus our attentions
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.060]   on what's important and what's not.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.060]   So what causes drifting?
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.580]   What are the things that are scary about drifting?
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.420]   How do we prevent it?
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.860]   And I'm sure for every single one of you, you absolutely do not want to drift too far
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.300]   away.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.160]   If you didn't care, you wouldn't be here, but you don't want to drift too far away.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.700]   And I'm sure there are some of you in here, you're putting your, you know, your church
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.780]   face on and you're saying the right stuff, but in your hearts, you feel like you're already
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.500]   drifting and you're so discouraged you don't know how to swim back.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.260]   So I want, if that's you, I want this retreat really to be one that is filled with hope,
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.260]   okay?
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.500]   How many of you guys would prefer to pick someone up at John Wayne over LAX?
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.060]   Raise your hand if that's the case.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.100]   If you have a friend coming in, if you have a family member coming in.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.580]   I hate LAX.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.580]   I've been to many airports in the world.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.940]   LAX sucks.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.440]   I hate it.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.140]   So I would much rather, so when the India team was leaving for John Wayne, I'm like,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.540]   no problem, I don't mind waking up at like 4 or something.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.620]   I have no problem going to John Wayne airport because it is close.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.100]   But if you were to pick up someone who just left JFK, you guys know where JFK is?
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.460]   It's New York, right?
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.820]   If they leave JFK on a flight toward John Wayne, but they're just one degree off, they
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.620]   end up at LAX.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.780]   So I would hate to be waiting at John Wayne and get a phone call from one of you, let's
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.220]   say, you're like, actually, I'm at LAX.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.020]   Can you come pick me up from LAX?
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.740]   I would say sure, but in my heart I would wrestle with hatred, right?
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.980]   Because it would take a couple hours to get there, because the freeway usually is not
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.580]   that bad, it's just when you get off the ramp, sometimes leading up to the airport takes
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.880]   an hour in and of itself.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.560]   I hate LAX.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.420]   But coincidentally, from John Wayne to LAX is 42 miles.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.220]   So if you're leaving from JFK, coming toward John Wayne, and you're off one degree, you
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.900]   go 50 miles adrift.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.900]   If you are leaving from Long Beach Harbor, and you want to go to Maui, I don't know why
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.980]   you would want to do this on a boat, but let's say for adventure's sake, you leave Long Beach
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.900]   to go to Maui, and you're one degree off, you end up in a very hostile territory of
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.980]   Papua New Guinea.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.980]   One degree.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:30.620]   So one degree off course from JFK to John Wayne, no biggie, a couple hours lost.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:39.380]   But one degree off course, Long Beach to Maui, you can end up with your life endangered.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.160]   So even one degree, given enough time, can radically take you away from where you're
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.500]   supposed to go.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   I'm looking right here, okay?
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.780]   What does one degree look like?
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.660]   I actually moved about three, okay?
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:03.440]   But one degree is not a big drift, but if you give it enough time, you end up very far
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.340]   off course.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:12.180]   And you know that when we usually drift, we're not just drifting one degree.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:18.740]   If there's like a swell or a storm in our life, oftentimes it ends up changing our entire
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.920]   trajectory, and this you guys are all well aware of.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.380]   If you drop your compass and you have to just figure stuff out by sight, you're screwed.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.060]   One degree makes a big difference.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.000]   So we're going to start out today in the first of our three sermons by looking at how frightening
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.160]   spiritual drifting and strain can be for us.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.700]   And imagine right now where you're sitting, I'm hoping that you are hoping to get to heaven
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.260]   at the end of your earthly journey.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:01.480]   I am hoping that you have assurance of your salvation that at the great white throne judgment,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.740]   you will be pronounced innocent.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.020]   That's what I'm hoping you're hoping.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:13.620]   But what if you're convinced that you're headed there and then you end up in a place where
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.820]   you don't want to go?
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.540]   That's a scary thought.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.300]   So we need to think through seriously how not to drift.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.140]   You have to pay careful attention.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.140]   And what do we pay attention to?
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.140]   What do we avoid?
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.700]   And we're going to look at that tonight.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.420]   So Matthew 7, 13, you guys are probably familiar with this.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.460]   This is on the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.540]   But I'm going to outline it for you first.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.140]   So if you're taking notes, you can just kind of follow along.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:52.100]   The first point is don't follow the crowds, Matthew 7, 13 to 14.
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:00.260]   Don't follow the crowds, 13 to 14.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   Second, don't follow blindly and don't follow the blind, verses 15 to 20.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.620]   Don't follow blindly and don't follow the blind, 15 to 20.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:21.700]   Third, don't follow false fruits, chapter 7, verse 21 to 23.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.420]   One, don't follow the crowds, 13 to 14.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:31.300]   Two, don't follow blindly, don't follow the blind, verses 15 to 20.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.180]   And third, don't follow false fruits.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.300]   If you are having a hard time keeping up, just email me.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   I'll send you my notes.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.940]   So don't stress too much about that.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.940]   Okay.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.380]   Verse 13 to 14, don't trust the crowds.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.420]   Let's look at this together.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.300]   Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.660]   destruction.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.300]   And there are many who enter through it, for the gate is small and the way is narrow that
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.340]   leads to life, and there are few who find it.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.980]   So what Jesus is saying here is the wide and the broad lead to what?
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.540]   Destruction.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.620]   Okay.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.460]   And then the small and the narrow lead to life, but only a few find the small and the
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.460]   narrow.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.380]   And that's what it's saying.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.320]   So a question that I have for you that you don't have to answer out loud, please do not
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.940]   answer out loud, just think through your head.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:34.220]   Is this person sitting on my right or my left?
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.900]   On the wide and the broad or the small and the narrow?
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:45.980]   Is this person on my right and on my left, is he on the broad and the wide or is he in
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.980]   the small and the narrow?
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.620]   It's kind of uncomfortable to think about, but what would you gauge that with?
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.200]   What would you judge that with?
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.260]   Where is this person on my right or my left?
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.660]   Where are they headed?
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:06.900]   Are the pastors at our church on the wide and the broad or the small and the narrow?
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.140]   I know what you're hoping for, okay, but are we, the four of us, indeed on the wide and
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.540]   the broad or the small and the narrow?
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:26.020]   And a more personal question, are you on the wide and the broad or the small and the narrow?
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.420]   How can you know for sure?
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.980]   What gate am I entering through and what road am I on?
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.700]   So this is a very important question.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.460]   Naja has a few who'd agree with that.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.780]   And you don't want to get this one wrong, okay?
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.940]   Is there a way to know for sure where you're headed?
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.900]   Is there a way to know for sure you have the right answer and you're headed in the right
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.420]   direction?
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.820]   Because the person on your right and the left can't answer that for you.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.220]   That is something that you have to discern, okay?
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.540]   So here's a description.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.140]   Jesus is saying, "Many are headed toward destruction.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.260]   Few are headed toward life."
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.900]   So for you and me, it's absolutely imperative every now and then to look around to see where
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.140]   my spiritual feet are, okay?
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.500]   So don't blindly follow the crowd.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.060]   Matthew 7, 13 to 14 is a very strongly worded passage.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.180]   15 to 20, I'm going to read this for you.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.380]   "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.100]   ravenous foals.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.100]   You will know them by their fruits.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.980]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.380]   So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.940]   A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:50.220]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:57.820]   So then you will know these false prophets by their fruits."
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.340]   Do you guys know how to pick out a false prophet from a true one?
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.180]   Some of them are more obvious.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.580]   If you're a false prophet and it's very obvious to everyone that you're a false prophet, you're
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.340]   a pretty bad false prophet, okay?
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.580]   So the ones that are really like obviously heretical and false, you don't need to worry
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.820]   about them.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.560]   They're dumb, okay?
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.820]   But can you recognize a false prophet when you see one?
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.180]   And this question, this is maybe a little bit tough, okay?
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:35.500]   You know what about something about false prophets?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.580]   It may not be obvious right away that they're false prophets.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.540]   And another thing that's scary about false prophets is they don't realize that they're
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.540]   false prophets.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:53.460]   You know 2 Timothy 3.13 says, "But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse,
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   deceiving and being deceived."
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.420]   So I actually often ask myself this question, "Am I a false prophet?"
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.980]   I stop and I ask myself this to align myself to make sure I am really seeking to speak
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.460]   on behalf of the Lord and not on behalf of myself.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.620]   But can you discern a false prophet?
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.340]   Many of the false prophets that are around you are ear ticklers.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.500]   If you look at 2 Timothy 4.3, they will say what the masses want to hear.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.140]   In Southern California, in Orange County, in the United States of America, and I guess
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.580]   globally, nod your heads if you would think that there are a lot of false prophets saying
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.340]   all kinds of things, guaranteeing all kinds of bad things, good things that are bad.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.420]   Yes, yes, right?
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.160]   Matthew 7.15-20 says that you and I need to beware, okay?
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.820]   That you will be able to pick out a false prophet by his fruits.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.300]   Grapes grow on grapevines, figs grow on fig trees.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.260]   True God-word genuine and real fruits come from true servants of God.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.380]   Bad fruit comes from the likes of these false prophets.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.260]   Okay, you guys logically following this?
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.300]   So here's an important question.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:19.600]   What are these good fruits that Christians must look for, not just in their spiritual
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.880]   guides, but in their own lives as well?
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.720]   What are these good fruits?
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:34.660]   What do you need to judge your pastors by?
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.840]   What do you need to judge your own life by?
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.480]   Can you discern a good from a bad fruit?
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.320]   And that is the question that I want to ask you today.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.400]   Matthew 7.13-14, don't follow the crowds.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.000]   Matthew 7.15-20, don't blindly follow, don't follow the blind.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.700]   So make sure if you really want to find yourself on the small and the narrow, that you're paying
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.440]   attention to the right guides.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.640]   And you get to this last section in Matthew 7, and this is where I'll be spending most
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   of the time this evening.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   Okay, don't follow false fruits.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.880]   So let's read this together.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.640]   Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.000]   does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.920]   Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.680]   name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?"
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.960]   And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.840]   This is one of the scariest passages in all the Bible.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:54.920]   This section here used to keep me awake at night.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.200]   I never knew you.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.880]   What we may think of fruits and what Scriptures define as good fruits actually may be very
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.920]   different.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.360]   Many will say to me on that day.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.880]   So there are many, okay?
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.160]   And so what do these many, what kind of fruit do these many have that doesn't quite fit
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.480]   the bill?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.880]   What are the things that these many did?
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.560]   First they called Jesus by the right title, okay?
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.880]   Lord.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.440]   They say it twice, "Lord, Lord."
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:35.480]   So these false people believe that Jesus was God.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:42.360]   And you guys know that just believing God is not enough, right?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.840]   You believe that God is one, you do well.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:52.000]   Even the demons believe and they, you guys are, the 69 of you who are memorizing James,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.800]   you've caught this, okay?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.280]   Even the demons believe and they shudder.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.800]   So these guys also prophesied in Jesus' name.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.080]   And prophesying is not necessarily teaching about or predicting the future.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:18.240]   When the Bible talks about prophesying, it means handling the Word of God in Jesus' name.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:27.040]   So these many, these fellows who are on the wide and the broad, they are calling God correctly
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.980]   and assessing His Godness.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:40.520]   They are accurately in Jesus' name teaching the Scriptures, handling His Word, perhaps
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.440]   even predicting things to come.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440]   What else are they doing?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.920]   They are casting out demons in Jesus' name.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:21:02.320]   If you saw someone casting out a demon legitimately, you would assume that that person is on the
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.140]   right side of God.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.320]   I would.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:13.560]   If someone was like flailing, clearly demon possessed, and a pastor of the church walked
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.200]   up to that person, laid his hand, and just prayed, and all of a sudden the person calms
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.040]   down, I would be like, "Dude, you're legit.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.320]   You've got some spiritual power.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.800]   I would be scared of that pastor."
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.400]   It's like, "Do you see a demon in my life?"
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.600]   You would literally be a little uneasy when you're around someone with this kind of power.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:44.200]   So this guy, Lord, Lord, handles prophesying in the name of Jesus, casting out demons in
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.240]   the name of Jesus, and they are performing a miracle, miracles.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:22:03.280]   If you saw me, Peter Chung, perform one miracle, if you saw me perform just one miracle, you
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.720]   would be amazed, especially if it wasn't like an illusion.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.160]   If it literally was a legit miracle, you'd probably be amazed.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.960]   And you may be tempted to think without a doubt, "Oh, that PPC guy has divine power."
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:26.680]   One, what if I performed five?
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.440]   What if I could raise someone from the dead?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.080]   What if someone had cancer, and I put my hands on that person's shoulder, prayed for that
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.880]   person, and next thing you know, the following week, that person is healed of cancer?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:53.760]   You would think that I am on the right side of God for not just one miracle, but many.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:03.760]   In verse 23, Jesus says to these guys who have called him the right name, prophesied
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.160]   in his name, cast out demons in his name, and performed many miracles in his name, Jesus
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   does not say, "No, you didn't do these things."
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.960]   Do you guys notice that?
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.600]   He doesn't say, "No, you didn't."
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.320]   And that's what's scary.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:31.080]   Acknowledging rightly who the Lord is, accurately handling and spouting off teachings and correct
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.960]   doctrine, casting out demonic influences and performing supernatural miracles are not the
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.640]   fruits that we're supposed to look for.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.320]   These are not the distinguishing marks of a God-approved spiritual leader or a God-approved
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.400]   saint.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.600]   Nod your heads if you understand.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.320]   Okay?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.120]   So in other words, I'm going to personalize this a little bit for you.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:07.240]   Don't automatically assume that every pastor or elder at Berean are ourselves on the small
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.360]   and the narrow.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.800]   Don't ever blindly trust me as the BAM pastor.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.960]   I may be a charlatan or a fraud, and I might not even be aware of that.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.600]   So don't ever trust me blindly.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.120]   And here are some things that you guys now have known me for about a year, for most of
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   you.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.360]   Some of you I've known for over 15.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.240]   But here are some things you may be tempted to trust in me.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.960]   One, it's hard to become a pastor at Berean.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.360]   There are many people who would love to be a pastor at Berean.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.720]   It's hard to get in here.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.520]   Nod your heads if you already do that.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.840]   We take our sweet old time.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.480]   The church took five years to ordain me.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   How many years?
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   Five.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   Okay?
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.360]   So I could have purchased my ordination in Korea, but I waited five for here.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.840]   All right?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.540]   So the qualifications are high.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   I got in.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.040]   Second, I've spent nearly a decade doing Great Commission work.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.480]   In fact, you can say I've even risked my life.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:21.200]   I've gone into North Korea twice after having a will written to scope out orphanages all
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.840]   over that place.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.120]   I done that.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.080]   I care about the poor.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   I want you to care about the poor.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.600]   And I've seen, people say, to have a decent handle on the Bible, Pastor Peter Kim trusts
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   me.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.640]   And when I preach, occasionally, not all the time, I may even cry.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.000]   Okay?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.680]   So these are things that might cause you to want to put your trust in what I say and listen
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.080]   to it with any kind of authority.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.200]   Those are solid qualities.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   If I objectively assess myself and if I could raise someone from the dead or heal someone
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.480]   from cancer, that really would help my case, would it not?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.200]   Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name cast out demons and in your
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.120]   name perform many miracles?
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.080]   I want to draw your attention to someone who did these things in even the context of the
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.680]   gospel accounts.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.800]   There was an apostle of Jesus Christ by the name of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.080]   You guys heard of him?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.420]   Apostle Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.520]   Let me tell you a little bit about him.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   He was with Jesus just like the other apostles for most of the three years Jesus did his
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.600]   public ministry.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.040]   He was with Christ.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.840]   Also, he was the keeper of the money bag.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:01.040]   Usually the people who are in charge of finances or accounts, you just assume that they're
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.120]   responsible and upright, right?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.680]   So we have some people in charge of our money, our BAM account, right?
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.540]   I'm hoping that they're trustworthy.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.360]   I assume that they're trustworthy.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.280]   Whoever is handling money, we naturally assume that they're a little bit more trustworthy
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.640]   than the others and that they're good at math, hopefully, right?
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:30.040]   In Matthew 10, you also see that Judas was given authority to heal the sick, raise the
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.440]   dead, cleanse the leper, cast out demons.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.720]   Freely you've been given, freely you've received, freely give, it says in Matthew 10.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.600]   So Judas had all of these things.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:55.800]   He knew how to even perform miracles that at that time would have astounded people.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:02.160]   Judas actually usually gives the right answer too and he's fast.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.020]   If you actually look at Matthew 25, it ends with this whole thing on why we need to serve
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.240]   the poor, okay?
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.200]   Matthew 25, when I was hungry, you gave me something to eat.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.940]   When I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.660]   When I was a wanderer, a soldier, you took me in.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.040]   When I was naked, you clothed me.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.600]   When I was sick, you took care of me.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.800]   And when I was in prison, you visited me.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:34.080]   And this whole section about how God is judging depending on how they handle the poor is immediately
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.000]   preceded by Matthew chapter 26.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.840]   A woman breaks an alabaster jar of fine perfume and one of the disciples in Matthew 26 says,
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.820]   "Why this waste?
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.480]   This could have been sold in the money given to the poor."
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.560]   It was worth what?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   A year's wages.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.280]   And you look at John's account, that was Judas who said that.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:13.640]   Judas can hear a good sermon and verbally give the right answer where the other disciples
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.300]   rarely ever did.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.580]   I want you guys to look at John 13.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:26.240]   Keep your finger here on Matthew 7 and I'm going to do a little bit of Bible study with
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   you.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   John chapter 13.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.200]   In John 13, people know better as the love chapter, okay?
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.840]   I want to show you, I think of it as the Judas chapter.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   John 13.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:53.160]   So verse 2, we see that the devil has put into Judas' heart to portray Jesus.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.240]   You guys read that?
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.720]   On a side note, Jesus washes his feet with tender love.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.120]   And that's something that is dumbfounding.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.840]   He knows that Judas set up this betrayal already and he's washing Judas' feet like he would
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.520]   the other 11 with the same compassion and love.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   That's our God.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:21.560]   But anyway, in verse 2, Judas is put, the devil puts in his heart to portray him.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:27.200]   Verse 10, Jesus is starting to get a little bit spiritually agitated and he says in verse
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   10, "Not all of you are clean."
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.880]   You guys see that?
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.920]   That's the first time Jesus is pointing to a betrayer.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.000]   Not all of you are clean.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.200]   Verse 18, "I do not speak of all of you."
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.640]   Okay?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.080]   Second time Jesus is talking about a betrayer.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.760]   Verse 21, "One of you will betray me," he says more explicitly.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.720]   Third time.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:02.120]   Verse 22, "The disciples began looking at one another at a loss to know of which one
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   he was speaking."
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.800]   They have no idea it's Judas.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.380]   You guys pick up on that?
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.560]   If you don't pick up on that there, we're going to keep reading.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.640]   Verse 24, Peter says, okay?
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.360]   So Simon Peter gestured to him and said to him, "Jesus, tell us who it is of whom he
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.720]   is speaking.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.840]   We have no idea one of us is going to betray you."
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:48.320]   Verse 28 to 29, Jesus in front of everybody says, "Whatever you're going to do, go and
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.640]   do quickly.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   Here is the morsel."
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.240]   Jesus said, "Whoever I give this to is going to betray me."
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.320]   He gives it to Judas and Judas hears, "Whatever you're going to do, go and do quickly."
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.200]   In verse 29, 28, 29, "Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.640]   he had said this to him.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.080]   For some were supposing because Judas had the money box that Jesus was saying to him,
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.720]   'Buy the things we have need of for the feast,' or else that he should give something to the
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   poor."
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.180]   Because remember, he said that, right?
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.080]   He had the right answer and Judas leaves.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:29.560]   That's fourth time that Jesus says, "One of you is going to betray me."
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:40.100]   He actually points to Judas as the betrayer and the disciples have no clue.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.960]   I remember as a child, I've had lots of children's Bibles, but I remember there's a one coloring
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.840]   book, like a Jesus and his disciples coloring book that I had, and in every page, you could
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.280]   tell who Judas was.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.000]   You know why?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.960]   He always has like a ... He's always like, "Every page, you knew right away who Judas
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.180]   was.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:15.800]   If you look at paintings of the disciples, you know who Judas is.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.080]   But you know what I learned from John 13?
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:33.240]   Judas was probably the last person they assumed would betray Jesus.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   Judas probably had no idea that he would do this when he signed up to be a disciple.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.920]   What does all this teach us?
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:57.160]   Why does God tell the likes of Samuel, and in a sense, to all of us, not to appearances?
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:05.040]   Because your spiritual vision and my spiritual vision are horrible.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:13.060]   We do not know how to judge people rightly in the flesh.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:24.800]   So Matthew 7, 21 to 23, I want to turn our attention back there.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.400]   Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord, we'll enter the kingdom of heaven, but he
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.440]   who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter."
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.400]   Many will say to me, like Judas, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.000]   In your name cast out demons, and in your name perform merry miracles, and then I will
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.440]   declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.060]   Apart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'"
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:51.220]   Matthew 27, verse 3, it says, "When Judas saw that Jesus had been condemned, he felt
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:57.820]   remorse and he returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders."
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.540]   And that's Matthew's account.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:09.260]   And I like to think through sometimes what was going through Judas' mind.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.040]   It doesn't say he wept, but I would assume he did.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.060]   I have shed innocent blood.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:24.940]   And I heard initially when people commit suicide or attempt to commit suicide, there's a lot
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.740]   of weeping and a lot of snot and a lot of tears the first time around because there's
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.980]   a terror.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:41.340]   Judas felt remorse, sadness, regret, remorse.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:47.740]   That's important to remember that the worldly sorrow does not lead to life.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:55.080]   So you and I feeling badly about not being perfect, you and I feeling badly about a sin
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.780]   or two that we commit is not repentance.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:09.140]   That could just be worldly sorrow, aka remorse.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.100]   Scariest passage in all the Bible.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.260]   Verse 21 to 23.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.940]   Verse 23, Jesus makes a declaration, okay?
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:26.420]   The Greek word is homologuesoi, so, so, homologueso.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.860]   That's a Greek word for declaration.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.740]   This is the only time he uses this word in all the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:40.140]   Jesus says, "Then I will declare homologueso to them.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:48.220]   I will pronounce, 'I never knew you.'"
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.700]   If you read John 5:22, you'll read that God the Father gives God the Son all judgment.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.860]   So the Father doesn't judge.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.500]   The Son judges.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:04.420]   And here you actually get a little preview of Revelation 20, the great white throne judgment.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:12.580]   And you see in verse 23 the shock of many who say, "Did we not?"
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.460]   And the judge says, "I never," he declares it.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.660]   A declaration is a pronouncement that cannot be reversed.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:26.180]   "I never knew you, depart from me you who practice lawlessness."
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:33.100]   So can you imagine with me, let's say you've given tons of money to the church.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.600]   Let's say you ended up serving the Lord as a pastor or a long-term missionary.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.340]   Let's imagine that you've shared verbally the Gospel with people.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.480]   Let's say you've done lots of, lots of Christian-y things.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.300]   You've been a member at a Bible teaching church for a few decades.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   You're a deacon.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.300]   You're an elder.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:55.020]   And you get to the throne of God and you hear this irreversible pronouncement, "I never
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.020]   knew you."
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.620]   Yeah, you would go out weeping.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.180]   Yeah, you would go gnashing your teeth.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.860]   Would you not?
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   This freaks me out.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.580]   I did all this stuff.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:15.300]   I thought, "Get out of here, forever."
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   I think I would do more than weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.820]   I'd probably like sock myself in the face.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.820]   I wouldn't know what I would do.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:33.140]   The point of this first sermon that we're talking about tonight, here's what it's not.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:38.020]   First, I'm not encouraging you to start judging people and wondering whether or not they're
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.020]   saved.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.020]   Okay?
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.220]   Pastor Peter, his child is saved.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.820]   You know?
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.380]   Ryan hasn't cooked as often lately.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.580]   Is he really saved?
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.420]   You know, that guy lost his temper on the basketball court.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.740]   Yeah, see, that's an unbeliever.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.460]   Elder Philip occasionally falls asleep during service.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.820]   Is he saved?
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.680]   That's not the point of this.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.140]   For you to go around and say, "Ooh, bad fruit.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.420]   Ooh, real fruit.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.660]   Ooh, preaching in...
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.980]   Oh, you had a good sermon, but that doesn't mean you're a Christian."
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.540]   That's not the point of this.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.020]   Okay?
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:27.100]   Second, I'm not telling you to never trust or submit to the leadership at Berean.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.620]   Just don't fully give all of your trust to us.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.220]   You guys following me?
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.340]   Is submitting to the leadership of the church, is that biblical?
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   Yes, it is.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.700]   Just don't treat us like we're Jesus.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.340]   Third, I'm not telling you to spiritually freak out and start doubting your salvation,
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:51.860]   although that might be what you feel like doing right now.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.900]   Do I really have real fruit?
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:02.860]   You might right now be wondering, "How do I then know?
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.740]   How do I judge this?"
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:13.100]   Because right now, I am scared that verse 23 is going to be said to me at the end of
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.060]   my life.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:23.860]   Don't freak out yet.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:29.060]   This is what I am doing to start off our retreat.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.100]   Two things, okay?
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:39.740]   First one, 2 Corinthians 13.5, there's an encouragement for you and me to examine ourselves.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:47.620]   It says, "Examine yourself to see whether you are of the faith.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.480]   Test yourselves.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.300]   Don't you realize that Christ Jesus is in you?"
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   Unless what?
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.060]   Unless, of course, you fail the test.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:07.740]   It is a healthy thing for you, occasionally, to check the location of your spiritual feet
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:16.260]   and wonder, "Am I on the small, gated, narrow road?"
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:25.100]   It is a healthy thing for you, occasionally, to examine your location with the help of
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.260]   a spiritual GPS.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:43.220]   And you will discover, if Christ is in you, you will be sure.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:54.620]   If the Holy Spirit of God is residing in your heart, you will know for certain.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:00.340]   You can't not know this if Christ is in your heart.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:05.100]   You guys following me?
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:10.140]   If you look into your heart, if you check your spiritual feet and you're thinking through,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.540]   "Am I on this small and narrow?"
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.620]   If the Word of God, by the empowering of the Holy Spirit, starts judging the thoughts and
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:26.780]   attitudes of your heart, He will make clear whether or not you really have His Spirit
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.020]   residing in your heart.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.220]   You can't not know it.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.060]   You guys with me?
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.500]   Okay.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.620]   This is not a call to trick yourself into thinking, "I am saved," when you're not.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:48.340]   But if Jesus Christ is powerfully residing in your heart, you will know for sure.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:54.020]   If you don't, keep examining yourself, is my encouragement.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:58.540]   And also, the second thing I want to do is just kind of set up the parameters for our
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.260]   retreat.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.460]   Recognize that you and I are naturally religious creatures, okay?
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.180]   Our natural response is, "Oh, what do I do?"
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:17.340]   And we judge others and ourselves by what we see on the outside, right?
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:22.740]   We actually look at the visible to judge.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.840]   But here's what a relationship with Christ is not, and this is what I tell our Sunday
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.780]   school teachers all the time.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.580]   A relationship with Christ is not morality.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:39.500]   If you are trying to be more moral, you may succeed in improving your morality, but that
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.060]   doesn't necessarily change your standing with Christ.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.740]   Morality is not faith.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:51.780]   Two, conformity to the church's expectations is also not genuine faith.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.060]   "Oh, this church says don't drink."
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.060]   I won't drink.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.660]   "This church says don't smoke."
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.900]   Oh, okay, I won't smoke.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.860]   "This church says tithe 15%."
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.660]   Oh, I got to tithe 15%.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.580]   "This church, everybody seems to have NASB."
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.020]   I got to get NASB.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:15.660]   All of these things that you feel conforming to the church's standards is not genuine salvation.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.020]   Nod your heads if you understand.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.020]   First one is morality.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.140]   Second one is conforming to the church's standards.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.420]   Third, Bible knowledge.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.300]   Bible knowledge is not salvation.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:38.820]   Now, if the spirit of Christ is dwelling in your hearts, will you be more moral?
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.180]   You will be an upright person.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.660]   If the spirit of Christ is dwelling within you, will you conform and fight for the church's
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.660]   passions?
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.180]   Yes, you will.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:56.180]   You won't feel judged by the church's expectations or that bar, but you will set it.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:01.620]   Third, your love for His word will increase.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.300]   But that's an inside-out change.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.360]   It's not an outside-in change.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:12.140]   So the application to this sermon is not to try to cuss less, to watch less, to do more,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.740]   to drink less, to party less.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.100]   That's not the application.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:27.420]   The application is, "Is Christ in my heart?" and to examine that.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:34.420]   Jesus Christ wants your soul, but you know who wants to kill your soul?
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.700]   It's like Voldemort.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.460]   Name him.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.980]   Satan.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.700]   He wants you dead.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.740]   He wants to destroy you.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.380]   He's out for blood.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:03.740]   And He will do everything in His power to kill you and everyone around you who loves
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.420]   Jesus Christ.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.300]   First Timothy 6.12, it says, "Fight the good fight of the faith."
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.220]   The word "fight" is agonizomai.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.220]   Agonizomai.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.340]   What's that sound like?
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.340]   Agony.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.420]   It says, "Agonize the agony."
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.740]   It's fight the good fight.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.260]   And back then, when you say, "Agonize the agony," you're looking at two boxers who have
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:32.060]   leather-like sashes wrapped around their hands, and inside those sashes are woven in glass,
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:37.280]   bone, sand, rock, so that when you fight, what happens?
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.760]   If you hit someone in the face with that on you, what happens to their face?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.520]   It becomes less of a face.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.720]   Usually when two boxers in those times, usually slaves, are pitted against each other, one
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.280]   of them died.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:58.320]   But usually the victor ended up crippled.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.840]   So the loser died, the victor ended up crippled.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   Guess what?
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.840]   Because why?
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840]   One of his eyes got punctured.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   Okay?
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.240]   So the rest of his life, he's walking around laying.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.760]   He's walking around blind.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.800]   But that is the kind of picture that we see when Paul says, "Fight the good fight of the
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   faith."
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:19.000]   You need to fight like your life and soul depends on it.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.200]   Not when it's convenient, but to fight.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.720]   The enemy hates you.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.880]   Did you guys know that the enemy hates you?
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.960]   Satan hates you.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:48.760]   He hates you with a passion and a fiery hatred.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.320]   But you know what he does to kill you?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.760]   He doesn't just go for your head and chop off your head, figuratively speaking.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:11.000]   He would prefer to infect you with some kind of disease so that you take it back and infect
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.760]   everyone around you so that everyone's dead.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.240]   It's like a roach.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.280]   How many of you guys like...
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Anybody like a cockroach?
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   No.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   Okay, common enemy, right?
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.680]   La cucaracha, right?
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.760]   If you see a cockroach, you can do one of two things.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.920]   One, crunch.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:34.360]   Or you could set a trap, and a lot of those traps have what?
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.000]   The little poison things.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   So this cockroach is going to town on this little, like, the trap, medicine ball.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.120]   Long time ago when I was growing up in like the '80s, they had actually the sticky traps
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.760]   where the cockroach would be like...
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.960]   You guys see those?
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.360]   But now they got creative and had these poisons so the roach goes into their nest and kills
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.800]   everybody.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.540]   That is, in a way, Satan's strategy for you.
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:03.200]   The way he wants to kill you is not outright just chop off your spiritual, like, neck.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.520]   He wants to make you useless.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.640]   He wants to make you a compromiser.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:15.480]   He wants you to drift so that everyone who's looking at you as the Christian standard in
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:23.160]   their life will also think it's okay to drift until you have a whole army of people on this
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.960]   wide and this broad.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.600]   At the end, we've done the Bible church stuff.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.840]   We've done all this stuff.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.660]   Look, Lord, in your name, look at...
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.940]   Did we not go to India?
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.100]   Did we not go to Japan?
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.660]   Did we not serve the poor?
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.300]   Did we not do these things?
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.940]   I never knew you.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.560]   Scary stuff.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.960]   One degree of drifting can destroy you.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.920]   And usually we don't drift this one degree.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:02.620]   Is it important to regularly check to see where your spiritual feet are?
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:08.660]   Nod your heads if you think it's yes.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:19.040]   Application for tonight is not dread because in my skewed opinion, it's tainted, okay?
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.000]   Don't take my word for it.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.600]   My assumption is most all of you are saved.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.800]   Not all, but most.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.640]   Otherwise, you wouldn't want to be here listening to the Word of God.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:44.680]   But examine yourself so that you can know for a little bit more of a certain standard
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   because you do not want to drift.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:54.080]   Because even if an apostle of Jesus Christ can drift and end up where he had no idea
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:02.280]   he would be, you and I could be the same.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:08.840]   My hope is that it sobers us so that tomorrow when we're thinking about what then do we
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.440]   do, we assess and apply correctly.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.640]   Amen?
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:29.720]   Assume that you may not be on the small and narrow and then work backward.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:36.040]   You know, Scripture says, "Well, you know, believe and don't doubt."
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.280]   That's a different context.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:47.960]   Here it says, "Examine your life really to see if you are of the faith."
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:55.480]   If the fruits of the Spirit, if that spiritual DNA is evident in you, examine that.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.880]   If it's not, repent because it's not too late.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.280]   These are things that we want to talk about in our small groups.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.960]   This is a great way to start the retreat, huh?
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:14.640]   You might not be going to heaven, but again, remember my purpose in sharing this is to
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:23.240]   show you how a slight drift can cause you to become a Judas Iscariot, which is the last
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.160]   thing you want to be.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.120]   He heard, "Depart from me.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.200]   Though you spent three years by my side, though you had authority, I never knew you."
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.960]   And that's an irreversible pronouncement.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.520]   In the book of Acts 1, it says, "It would have been better if he wasn't born."
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.400]   So examine.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:49.160]   And tomorrow, we're going to start seeing as we examine and conclude that Christ is
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:57.320]   in us, what do we do to protect ourselves from drifting?
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.280]   So it's important stuff.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   Amen?
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.680]   It's important stuff.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:08.080]   And I pray that you commit to me that I don't drift.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.280]   And I need to commit to you that you don't drift.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.560]   And we're going to learn about that tomorrow too.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:20.400]   So that together, we really can serve the Lord faithfully so that the end of our lives
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   we hear, "Well done."
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.560]   And that's in Matthew 7 too.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.560]   It's all there.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.240]   The "well done" is in there.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.000]   Not those words verbatim, but it's in there.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.040]   So we're going to break up into our small groups.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   But before we do that, let's pray.
