[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   Those of you guys who are in the far back by the cafe,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.560]   please go ahead and at this time make your way over
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.480]   to your tables.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560]   And also, good news, we do have a new water dispenser
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.880]   right in the middle of the cafe.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.840]   I guess that deserves a clap.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.360]   You don't have to walk all over the sanctuary.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.920]   And then please use your refillable water bottles,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.560]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.640]   So again, let's make our way over to our seats,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.360]   and we'll get started in just a moment.

[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.520]   OK, good.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.640]   Let's gather our hearts for a word of prayer
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.080]   as we start our evening off in our Bible study.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.640]   Let's pray together, everyone.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.000]   OK.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.040]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for your grace.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.560]   And Lord, we want to continue to pray that in our hearts, Lord,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.680]   we would continue to seek your spiritual blessing.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.440]   Above and beyond all the things that we can touch with our hands
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.840]   and see with our eyes, we pray, God,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.000]   that we would see all the more of the incredible treasure
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   that we have in Christ and the blessing of your presence,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.160]   your word, instruction, all the things that guide us
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   through your spirit we are so grateful for.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.320]   And I pray, Lord, that what we seek
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.440]   with the intent of our mind and the striving of our hearts
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.760]   would always be you.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   And so I pray, God, that tonight it
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.520]   would be a blessing, Lord, where we can dive into your word,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.160]   share the things that we find in your scripture,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.240]   but also really discuss and fellowship over how
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   it can apply into our lives.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.760]   And we ask, God, that by prayer, Lord, that the moments
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.560]   that we have together would truly
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.640]   go above and beyond just an intellectual exercise,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.080]   but that, God, it would truly be a spiritual one.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.800]   And now, Lord, as we lift our voices to you,
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.920]   we pray, God, that it be something so honoring as we
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.680]   lift it up from our faith.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.240]   And, God, as our voices unite together to lift you up,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.120]   would you be praised.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.040]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.240]   Let's all rise-- actually, we can stay seated.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.320]   If you stay seated, we'll go into time of worship.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.820]   Thanks.

[00:06:46.280 --> 00:07:06.160]   Christ's assuring steady anchor in the fury of the storm,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.880]   when the winds of doubt blow through me
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.600]   and my sails have all been torn.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:25.120]   In the suffering, in the sorrow, when my sinking hopes are few,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.760]   It shall never be removed.

[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:59.880]   when temptation claims a battle, and it seems a knight has won.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.640]   Deeper still than goes the anchor,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:14.120]   though I justly stand accused, I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   It shall never be removed.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:35.400]   Christ's assuring steady anchor through the floods of unbelief.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   Hopeless thunder, oh, my soul, now lift your eye to Calvary.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   This my ballast of assurance, see his love forever proved.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.240]   I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   It shall never be removed.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:20.560]   Christ's assuring steady anchor as we face the wave of death,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.320]   when these trials give way to glory,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.080]   as we draw our final breath.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   We will cross that great horizon,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   bounds behind and life secure.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:49.320]   And the calm will be the better for the storms that we endure.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   Christ, the shore of our salvation, ever faithful,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:04.640]   ever true, we will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.080]   It shall never be removed.

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:36.440]   Jesus Christ, I think upon your sacrifice.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:46.280]   You became nothing, poured out to death many times.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.760]   I've wandered at your gift of life,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.960]   and I'm in that place once again.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   And I'm in that place once again.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:09.600]   Once again, I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:16.160]   Humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.480]   Once again, I thank you.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.720]   Once again, I pour out my life.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:35.800]   Now you are exalted to the highest place,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:42.400]   king of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.920]   But for now, I marvel at this saving grace,
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.120]   and I'm full of praise once again.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   And I'm full of praise once again.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.360]   And once again, I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:15.120]   I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.520]   Once again, I thank you.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.640]   Once again, I pour out my--
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   Once again, I look upon the cross where you died.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.960]   I'm humbled by your mercy, and I'm broken inside.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.440]   Once again, I thank you.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.640]   Once again, I pour out my life.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.880]   OK, with a lot happening this weekend,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.400]   I just want to highlight a couple announcements for us.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.720]   This Sunday, it was already announced
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.480]   that we're going to be observing the communion table.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.720]   And so please take some extended time preparing your heart,
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.920]   praying.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.000]   If there's anything to confess, think about our Lord
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   and just currently where you're at with the Lord at this time.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.000]   And then on Sunday, what we're going to do
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.880]   is actually observe the communion
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.160]   by going back to coming up to receive
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.560]   the elements from the table.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.520]   So please keep that in mind.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.560]   Secondly, for our men's ministry, on the 15th,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.480]   from 9 AM, we have our meeting.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.320]   There's going to be a guest speaker, Pastor Paul Pack.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.600]   And we're going to be having a good time fellowshipping
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.040]   both learning, praying together, and then we'll
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.720]   cap it off with a lunch fellowship with the taco guy.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.000]   So please make sure if you happen to forget or et cetera,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.720]   just go ahead and do it on your phones right away.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.640]   And be sure to sign up for that, OK?
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.840]   All right, at this time, please go ahead and break off
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.240]   into your groups and have a good time of discussion.

[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   All right, let's get started.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   OK.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.000]   Can you hear me?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.680]   Can you hear me?
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.180]   Hello?
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.480]   Jeremy, can you hear me?
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.800]   Jeremy Wong, can you hear me?
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.280]   OK.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.600]   All right, let's get started.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:58.920]   All right, we're in second.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.560]   Peter chapter 1, verse 12 through 15.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:08.160]   Short passage, but again, let me pray for us
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.120]   and then we'll jump in.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:18.360]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued grace
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.680]   and the word that you give us to speak to us.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.680]   I pray that you would open our thoughts, our mind,
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.280]   our own hearts, Lord God, that your word would not simply
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.880]   be an academic endeavor, but I pray
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.960]   that you would mold us, guide us,
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.400]   that our emotions, our thoughts, our wills, our lives
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.440]   may all be formed, Lord God, by your word.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.640]   So we pray for grace.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.800]   We pray for understanding.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.960]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.000]   Amen.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.480]   All right, so the people on the other side of the cafe,
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.240]   can you hear me?
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.760]   We had some technical issues last time, so can--
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.640]   OK.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.520]   Give me one second.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.280]   I want to double check.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   Last time it didn't turn on, so they had to double check.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.880]   How's the noise in here?
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.800]   It's good?
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.640]   How's the noise level in here?
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.240]   Are you able to hear each other better?
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.640]   Huh?
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.760]   Oh, it helps.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.160]   Yeah, it better help.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.120]   With all the time and effort they put into this?
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.280]   Richard says in a couple of months
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.120]   you're not going to hear each other.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.480]   That's his goal.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.080]   All right, so let's look at the text in 2 Peter.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.520]   So the text begins by verse 12.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.160]   It says, "Therefore I will always be ready to remind you."
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.480]   So I'm pretty sure I don't need to say anything,
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.400]   but what is the theme that is repeated here in this text?
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:02.360]   "Remind, even though you already know them,
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.280]   that you are already establishing the truth to which
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.080]   you present, I consider it right.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.440]   As long as I am earthly dwelling,
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.600]   I stir up to you reminder.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.560]   Knowing that, laying aside my earthly dwelling,
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.400]   Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me to be diligent.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.120]   Any time since departure you will be able to recall,
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.160]   call these things to mind."
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.200]   OK, so over and over and again he
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.400]   says I'm writing this because I'm trying to remind you.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.960]   I'm remind you to stir you up.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.720]   I'm reminding you so that when I leave
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.440]   that you can remember even after I'm gone.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.960]   So clearly the theme is to remind.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.720]   What is he trying to remind them of?
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.080]   What's so important that he needs
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.080]   to do this in repetition over and over again?
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.120]   What is he referring to?
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:51.400]   What he said in the beginning, right?
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.640]   Remember what we talked about last time?
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.280]   Remember, he mentions it in the first four verses.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.800]   And then what we talked about last week
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.640]   is the diligent pursuit of our sanctification.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.440]   But the beginning part of it here, where he says,
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.640]   "Bond-serving to those who have received a faith."
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.760]   The same kind, how do we receive it?
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.440]   "By the righteousness of God, our Savior, Jesus Christ."
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.840]   So this is referring to justification.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:30.320]   So first part of it is justification by grace.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.280]   Second part of it, "Seeing that his divine power has granted
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.920]   to us everything pertaining to the life of godliness
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.520]   through the true knowledge of him who called us by his--
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.720]   So this is--
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.120]   what is it?
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.080]   Sanctification.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.560]   By what?
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.880]   By grace.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.600]   Everything you need for life of godliness, by grace.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:59.760]   Sanctification by grace.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.400]   "For by these he has granted to us
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.920]   his precious and magnificent promises,
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.560]   that what you will receive, so that by them
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.840]   you may become partakers of the divine nature,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.560]   having escaped the question of the--" this referring
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.640]   to glorification.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.800]   By what?
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.320]   By grace.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:31.040]   So he is reminding them, do not forget over and over again
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.560]   that your justification is by grace.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.920]   Your sanctification is because God has granted to us.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:43.040]   The hope that we have is because of grace.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.920]   So the foundation which we build,
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.160]   the thing that we do is recognizing
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.760]   that he has given it to us by the grace of God.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.600]   So everything that we pursue is because of the grace of God.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.520]   And this is something that has to be reminded repeatedly
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.680]   over and over again.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.360]   So what happens when you start to believe that justification
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.080]   is by your works?
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.880]   What negative effects does it have on your life
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.040]   when you begin to--
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.280]   you may not say justification by works,
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.000]   but you start to live like it.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.520]   What happens?
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:23.120]   What usually happens if you think
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.040]   you're justification by works?
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:33.860]   Legalism?
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:40.960]   Or pride, if you think you're doing well?
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.280]   Burnout?
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:43.840]   Keep saying it.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.000]   You guys all know.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.520]   Burden?
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:57.600]   You're never either-- you're never good enough
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.120]   or you're too good.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.000]   So it has an opposite effect, one or the other.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.880]   Same thing with justification, sanctification.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.200]   If you're pursuing sanctification by your works
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.400]   alone, what happens?
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.440]   Same thing.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.360]   So you think like, oh, I did it.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.640]   Oh, I found this system.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.880]   Or I was more disciplined.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.280]   I was more serious.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.240]   He says, no, everything has been granted to you.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.560]   So even the things that we pursue
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.280]   is because God's been gracious to me.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.920]   So the reason why I'm even able to understand,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.480]   even able to desire it, is because God's
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.440]   been gracious to you.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.600]   So the foundation upon why we pursue righteousness is grace.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.280]   So when we are pursuing righteousness by grace,
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.440]   what is the default setting for a Christian?
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:55.800]   Humility.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.120]   Humility.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.160]   Because what I have, God gave it to me.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.720]   I'm able to do this because God's been gracious to me.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.640]   What happens when you start to think
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.100]   that glorification is by grace, even though all these things
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.200]   are connected?
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.000]   Same thing.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.360]   Either you fall into defeatism or you
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.840]   fall into arrogance and pride, legalism or judgmentalism.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.960]   You end up being one or the other if you're not careful.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.720]   And so if you look at the end result, the fruit
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.680]   of your labor, and if it results in one or the other,
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   it's because you have forgotten this.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.640]   You have forgotten this.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.400]   Or it's kind of in the back of your memory,
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.080]   but this isn't what's motivating you.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.520]   Your primary reason for what you're doing,
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.920]   this is not the reason.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.520]   That's why Peter is saying, I'm going
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.960]   to keep reminding you this, because your Christian life,
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.880]   justification, sanctification, glorification,
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.040]   their default setting is you didn't deserve it.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.780]   God gave it to you.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.520]   So whatever you're pursuing is because by the mercy of God,
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.640]   by the grace of God.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.280]   So what ends up happening when you're motivated by this?
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.800]   First of all, it leads to our humility.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.120]   It leads to compassion.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.640]   It leads to grace.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.000]   Even the byproduct of what we do ultimately leads to grace.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.760]   So again, this is why Paul says this is so important for us
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.360]   to pursue.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.000]   That's why he said, I'm going to remind you repeatedly
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.120]   over and over again.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:29.920]   And he says, I'm going to do this even though you know
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.240]   already, even though you're already established in this.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.080]   Only reason why you're even established,
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.040]   you understand what I'm saying, is
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.600]   because God's been gracious to you.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.960]   And this is present in you.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.800]   And I know if you use another translation besides NASB,
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.840]   these two things are put together.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.360]   But in the NASB, they decided to kind of separate it.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.400]   This idea is that I'm going to keep reminding you,
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.920]   even if you know them, even though you're doing great
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.760]   and you're already established in this truth,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.840]   the truth of grace.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.600]   And even though this is presently--
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.040]   I'm not saying this to you because I see a great need in
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.920]   it, but I'm saying this so that you don't stray from this.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.560]   So whether you are in need or whether you're doing great,
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.240]   this is how important this is.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.120]   Because the moment you stray from this
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.600]   is where you will work your tail off
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.680]   and lead to either defeatism or legalism.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.520]   So you can work hard and then at the end feeling like,
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.240]   oh, I did nothing, because you're not measuring up
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.440]   to your own standard.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.680]   Or you end up thinking like, I did it,
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.400]   and you end up becoming proud.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.560]   So again, can't emphasize enough.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.760]   He says, I'm not saying this to you because this church
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.560]   or these people in particular had a problem with this.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.320]   He says, no, they're actually very well established in this.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.640]   I'm going to keep reminding you because after I leave,
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.560]   this is what's going to cause you to continue.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.000]   If you're going to continue in your walk with God
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.080]   and bear fruit, you're going to have to remember
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.840]   it's justification by grace, sanctification by grace,
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.280]   and glorification by grace.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.000]   So he says, I consider it right, long as I
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.560]   am in the earthly dwelling, to stir up by way of reminder.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.000]   So the first thing he says, why?
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.800]   Why is he saying this?
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.600]   He says to stir up.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.560]   Anybody look up the word stir up?
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.040]   What is the word stir up, another way
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.280]   that this can be translated?
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:44.400]   OK, awaken.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.000]   Anybody else?
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.360]   To make it happen?
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.440]   To be captive?
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.880]   Oh, to make active, OK.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:03.200]   Yeah, I said to make captain.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.320]   Make active, to arouse.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.200]   So this word basically means I want
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:18.560]   to keep reminding you in order to continue to stimulate you.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.360]   So what's the motivation?
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.800]   What's the energy behind why you want to pursue sanctification?
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.360]   Why you want to be pure?
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360]   Why you want to be godly?
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.640]   Why you want to practice love and grace and discipline?
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.240]   What's the motivation behind that?
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.360]   Not for your acceptance, not so that you can be accepted here,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.280]   not so that you can have respect of people.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.240]   What's the motivation behind the motivation of grace?
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.760]   What is what causes you to be stirred up?
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.520]   God's love for you.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.080]   God's love for me.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.040]   So if the love of Christ is not what can compel me,
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.000]   then what is compelling you?
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.920]   If the love of God is not at the center of compelling you
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.560]   to be righteous, to be holy, to practice love,
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.480]   then what else is compelling you?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:25.320]   Probably social pressure, guilt, fear, judgment, rejection,
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.360]   expectations of people.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.760]   So if it is not the love of Christ compelling you,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.560]   you have something else compelling you.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.560]   And if anything else is the ultimate cause
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.760]   of what compels you, what's going to end up happening?
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.400]   You're not going to make it.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.520]   Eventually you're going to fall apart
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.960]   because you're not going to have fuel to continue in your faith.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.400]   That's why he says he's going to remind you continually
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.000]   to stir you up, to wake you up, to make you active,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.360]   to arouse you to continue.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   So that's why when we practice accountability,
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.720]   accountability only works with people
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.560]   who are already being motivated by the love of Christ.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.160]   Or accountability alone is not going to cause you to be holy.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.000]   Because if the love of Christ is not compelling you
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.800]   and you happen to be a group and they're asking you,
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.480]   did you do it or did you watch porn or did you do this or not?
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.640]   You'll do it for a little bit because you don't want to be ashamed
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.560]   when you come, but eventually you'll find another way.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.160]   Covenant ice isn't going to keep you from watching porn.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160]   You can watch it at work.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.040]   You can get a VPN.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.480]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.960]   So if your motivation is simply the shame of the people that are around you,
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.800]   eventually it's not going to work.
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.560]   So even accountability is only going to work within the context of people
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:49.480]   who are being stirred up by justification by grace,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.720]   sanctification by grace, glorification by grace.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   And then he said, "Knowing that, that laying aside of my earthly dwelling
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.040]   is imminent," meaning he knows.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.320]   He knows he's about to go.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.200]   What was the difference?
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.480]   In the beginning, we talked about how when Paul was writing 2 Timothy,
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.960]   he knows that he's going to go.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.000]   He says, "I'm being poured out as a drink offering."
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.240]   He knows he's going to go.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.480]   So he's writing.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.280]   So that's his last letter.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.240]   This is Peter's last letter.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.840]   What was the difference between the two letters?
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.520]   Do you remember?
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.160]   Not simply the content, but to whom?
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.280]   To whom was the letters written to?
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.360]   What is 2 Timothy?
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   Huh?
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   Yes, to Timothy.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   And who's Timothy?
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.360]   Spiritual son.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   What kind of spiritual son?
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   He's a pastor.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.360]   We call that a pastoral letter because he's writing that letter to Timothy,
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.360]   who's his spiritual son, because he's establishing him as a pastor of Church of Ephesus
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   to go back and persevere.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   So he's writing a very personal letter to the pastor on how to lead his church.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.360]   2 Peter is written to who?
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   To the congregation.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.360]   Not one particular congregation, but just regular people.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   So 2 Timothy, what's the main thing that he says over and over again to 2 Timothy?
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.360]   Yes.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:46.360]   The main theme in 2 Timothy is do you make sure that you will be responsible that the Word of God is being taught,
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   whether they obey or disobey, whether it's in season or not season.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   Your job is to keep teaching the Word of God.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:21:02.360]   And so as a pastor passing it on to his protege, he wants to make sure that Timothy is going to fight for the truth.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.360]   Now Peter is writing to the congregation, and what's in his mind?
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360]   For them to persevere in their faith.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.360]   After I leave, I don't want to see you falling apart.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   So he goes back, and he actually goes back into the content of the gospel.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   Make sure that you don't fall apart.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   You keep remembering even after I leave.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   And he says he knows he's going, so this is his last thing that he wants to say.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   So we're not there yet, but first chapter is this.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.360]   Is the content of the gospel, and you persevere in this.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   And then remember what chapter 2 is about?
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   False teachers that are coming.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   You keep doing this.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   You remember this.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:57.360]   When the false teachers come, and they start teaching strange things, it's because their judgment has been determined long ago.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   Don't follow them. Don't envy them.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   You stick to what you already know. You remember this.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   And then chapter 3, and when it gets hard, remember Jesus is coming.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   Even though people are telling you, "Where is he?"
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   You say, "He's coming."
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   And so that's how 2 Peter is organized as his last letter.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   Don't forget what you already know.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   Pay attention to false prophets so that you don't stray from what you already know.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.360]   And when things become difficult in walking with God, make sure you persevere because Jesus is coming.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.360]   And that's 2 Peter in a nutshell.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   And it says, "And I will also be diligent that at the time after my departure, you will be able to call these things to mind."
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   So it's the same thing I'm telling you.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   It's not like, "Okay, now I learned fundamentals one on one.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.360]   Now we're going to get to 201 and the 301 and 401."
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360]   He says, "No, remember. Keep remembering."
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   Remember in Church of Ephesus, when they lost their first love, when they were practicing all of these things,
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   and because their love group cold, what did he say?
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   "Remember."
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   "Remember where you started."
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.360]   And then repent. Go back to where you started.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:15.360]   He doesn't say, "Here's like 15 things. You got one. Now go look for the other 14."
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   He says, "No, what you have has been given to you in the beginning."
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:26.360]   Not five years later, not because of many years of training, not because of all these experiences,
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.360]   not because of so much education, not because so many books have been read.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:37.360]   He says, "No, everything that you have has been given to you in the beginning."
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   So does that mean that we don't need to study the Bible?
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   If everything has been given to you in the beginning, then why do we need to continue?
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:55.360]   Why do we need to dig? Why do we need to study? We already know everything.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   It's an open question.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   You don't know?
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   What are your thoughts? Why do we study the Bible?
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.360]   One, because we forget. Yes. Right?
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   What else?
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360]   Definitely that. Right?
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]   It's constantly two.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   That's one of the best ways to remember is to keep studying it.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   But what else?
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   Remember what he says in Ephesians?
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:44.360]   Paul's prayer?
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   That you would understand the love of Christ, but in what manner?
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   How deep? How strong? Right?
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.360]   So basically he says, "I'm praying for you so that you do not just understand the love of Christ,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   but you would understand the depth of the love of Christ."
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:07.360]   That you don't just understand your sins, but you understand the depth of your sin.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.360]   You don't understand just God's sovereignty, the depth of His sovereignty.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   So everything that we're learning about God, we already know.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.360]   But we know as a child. Right?
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.360]   Just like you ask a child, "Do you love me?" Of course they love you.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.360]   They love you, you know.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   But as you get older, you understand your parents more, and you understand the sacrifice that they've made.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   So is your love different?
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:41.360]   No. You still love, but there's a degree of understanding of the sacrifices that people who have poured into you,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   and so you start to deepen your appreciation toward things that you already have. Right?
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   That's our spiritual growth, when we understand the depth of what we have.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.360]   So we already have everything that we need. Right?
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   Everything we need was given to us the day that we met Christ.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   But for the rest of our lives, we're trying to understand the depth of what we have.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.360]   We understand, "He loved me. He died for me." Right?
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.360]   But what did it really take for the Son of God to die?
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   What did it take the Son of God to take on human form?
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   What did it mean for Him to absorb our sins upon Himself?
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.360]   All of this stuff we knew superficially.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that He died for you." Right?
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360]   We knew that from day one.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   But what does it mean for the Son of God to die?
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.360]   What does it mean for the Son of God to become sin?
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   What does it mean for us to become adopted children?
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   So there's a depth of understanding in the things that we already know that we are to continue. Right?
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   So we're not necessarily learning completely different things.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   In fact, the majority of the time when somebody tells you that they found something new,
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:48.360]   it's probably not from the Bible. Right?
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.360]   I mean, for 2,000 years we've been studying this,
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.360]   and nothing has changed except for the depth of what we understand. Right?
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.360]   How do we keep the Gospel message from becoming stale in our lives?
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   So this is part of the discussion questions that I'm going to leave with you,
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.360]   but I wanted to go over this with you, and I'm sure you can add to this. Right?
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   I think if we are to continue to remember not to forget, even for the rest of our lives,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   but to grow in depth of what we have in Christ, we celebrate.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:27.360]   That's why we come to church, and we celebrate what we have in Christ.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.360]   We don't just come to Christ begging Him because I have a list of things that I want from Him.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:37.360]   But our main part of worship is to celebrate what He has given us.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   That's what ultimately communion is. Communion isn't simply repenting. Right?
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   Confessing our sins and getting right with God is required,
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:50.360]   but the primary meaning of communion is to celebrate. Right?
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   Celebrate what God has already given us. That's why corporate worship is so important.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:03.360]   If we don't take corporate worship significantly, then we end up celebrating kind of in a casual manner.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.360]   Whatever you don't celebrate on a regular basis, you have a tendency to become stale.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.360]   Second, learn from it from other people's perspective. Right?
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.360]   Maybe you've been walking for a while. It's like, "I know that."
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   I hear people all the time, especially people who have gone through seminaries
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   or pastors are guilty of this or leaders are guilty of this.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.360]   "Oh, yeah. I took 2 Peter in seminary, so I know this." Right?
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.360]   How many times can you hear the gospel? "Oh, I preached about this so many times.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.360]   I already did this. I did quiet time in this."
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.360]   It's already become stale to them. That's what it means.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.360]   Anybody who thinks that they've exhausted the understanding of any book or any topic
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.360]   is because it's become stale to them. Right?
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.360]   But it's never stale because I can learn the same thing, but I can learn it from your perspective.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.360]   I could tell you what Christ means to me, but what does Christ mean to you?
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.360]   How did he save you? Right? What's motivating you?
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   So sometimes when I—majority of the times when I hear your testimony,
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   even though it's something that I already know, it helps me to see things from your perspective.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   And there's things that I—it reminds me about my testimony and when I hear your testimony,
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.360]   but it also gives me a different light. Right?
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   Some of you came to Christ because of logic. Right? Some of you.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   Some of you came because you were so touched by the love of Christ. God bless you.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   Some of you came to Christ because you were deep in your sins and you had no way out.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.360]   Some of you came to Christ because you had no hope. Right?
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.360]   Every single one of our testimonies, we came to Christ because of different reasons.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:44.360]   So you came through the same entrance, but the path you took to get to that entrance
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.360]   is different from each different person. Right?
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:53.360]   So when we learn it from other people's perspective, right, even though it's the same thing,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   it's kind of like watching a movie and you're seeing it from a child's perspective
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   versus a movie critic's perspective versus a first-time watcher's perspective
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   versus a fanatic's perspective. They all give you a different perspective.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   And they all notice different things about the movie. Right?
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.360]   You hear from one language and from a different language, it's different. Right?
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.360]   Three, go deeper into greater understanding what you already know. Right?
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.360]   I remember the last time that it really hit me like a ton of bricks is that
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   some of you guys remember when Dr. Harris was here and we read that book,
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:37.360]   Darkness and the Glory, and he described how God drew near to his son
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   and the world went dark for three hours and how it was God drawing near
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.360]   because he was going to punish his son for our sins.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   Most of you guys weren't there for that. But I remember reading that just being blown away.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   I don't know how many times I preached that. I don't know how many times I preached the gospel.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   But when I read that, it was like I was reading that for the first time.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:03.360]   And just the depth of his love that he would do this. He didn't just passively hand over his son.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.360]   He actually did it himself, brought the punishment to his son by himself.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   He did it by his hands. And he made his case for that, how God would show up
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.360]   every time a new covenant is ratified so it would only make sense that God drew near.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.360]   And the reason why it went dark is because if he doesn't come in darkness, people die.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   So he had to come in darkness in order to come draw near to his son and punish his son for our sins.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.360]   I remember reading that just blown away.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   Even though it's the same gospel I've been preaching for so many years.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   And so the depth of what it is that we already know is so deep that no matter how long you dig,
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   the more you end up appreciating and you realize how shallow of an understanding that we had.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:57.360]   And how deep does this go? To eternity.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   I believe that we're just scratching the surface and when we get to eternity,
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.360]   that the depth of who he is is going to be revealed more and more.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.360]   I think we're going to be doing inductive Bible study in eternity.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   In a different way. We're not going to be scratching, but we're going to be studying God.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   And we're going to be knowing about who he is and the depth of his love.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   There's things to this day I don't understand.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   Why would you give your son?
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.360]   That's a kind of love that you and I would never think to practice.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.360]   We wouldn't even think that that's good.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.360]   Why would I give what's most precious to me?
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.360]   Not only to somebody that may not be good, but is actively going against me.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.360]   Why would I do that for your sake?
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   So there's a kind of love that you and I don't understand.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.360]   We just sing it, but we don't really deeply understand.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.360]   And I think everything that we know, we're just scratching the surface.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   So going deeper, that's why we study the Word of God.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:08.360]   If the Word of God starts to come alive to you, it will come alive to you when you begin to see the roots.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   When you begin to see the roots and the depth of what it is that you think you already know,
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   the Word of God begins to come alive.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.360]   And it's different when I tell it to you than when you find it.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.360]   That's why inductive Bible study is so important.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.360]   Then practice it.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.360]   You can't just study it in your head. You have to apply it.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.360]   There's a huge difference between applying the Word of God than studying the Word of God.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.360]   It's just like when Paul is telling Timothy to persevere,
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:41.360]   hearing as a pastor that all the persecutions and not bearing fruit and people falling out,
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   and hearing that as a pastor makes a world of difference in my perspective.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   And so same thing. If you're married, there's a perspective you will have of a married person.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.360]   If you're single, there's a perspective that you will only have.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.360]   There's a perspective that you will have if you have many children.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.360]   There's a perspective that you will have if you don't have children.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.360]   And so there's a huge difference between how the Word of God sounds to you
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.360]   based upon how you're living your life.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   And so practice in obedience.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.360]   And then share it with others. Get in the habit of whatever it is that you've been touched by.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.360]   If something in your Bible study mate says, don't just share it just with your small group.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.360]   Share it with your friends. Get in the habit of fellowshipping and telling other people.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:34.360]   And the more you share it to other people, the more the things that God has blessed you is going to multiply.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.360]   I guarantee you. One of the biggest benefits for me as a pastor is that I have to teach it.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.360]   And so because I have to teach it, I'm constantly sharing.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.360]   And so the Word of God becomes a lot more, it makes a lot more sense to me as a pastor
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.360]   because I have to go deeper in order to share with you.
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.360]   And then every time I share with you, and if you get blessed, I get blessed because you get blessed.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.360]   And then finally, get in the habit of teaching it to others.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.360]   Find people who don't know. Don't just hold it to yourself.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.360]   That's a part of being in a community. Find somebody.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360]   Don't be frustrated that other people don't know.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:16.360]   If they don't know, that means you're filled with opportunities to teach.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.360]   It's interesting to me how people come to church and say, "Oh, we don't have an opportunity to share.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   We don't have opportunities to serve."
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.360]   You're surrounded by people who have shallow understanding of the Word of God.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.360]   You're surrounded by people who don't know Christ.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.360]   What do you mean there's no opportunity to serve?
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   You are surrounded. Even in this room, you are surrounded by people that you can easily sit down and help them.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:45.360]   You don't have to have a title. You don't have to be part of a group.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.360]   You are surrounded every single day, opportunity to serve.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:54.360]   So when we are celebrating it, when we are learning it from other people's perspective,
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.360]   when you go deeper into the study of the Word of God, when you begin to practice what it says,
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:05.360]   you begin to share it with your friends, and you get in the habit of teaching.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:13.360]   I think this is a very practical way to make sure that the gospel or salvation doesn't become stale.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:17.360]   I know that previously we had a movement called the Gospel Center Movement,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.360]   and one of the key themes of the Gospel Center Movement is "Preach the gospel to yourself."
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.360]   I have nothing against preaching the gospel to yourself because it's that important,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.360]   but if you're in the habit of preaching gospel to others, you end up preaching it to yourself.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   You kill two birds with one stone.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.360]   But if you only preach the gospel to yourself, you're going to miss out on a whole other part.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.360]   So focus on preaching the gospel, teaching other people, and helping others to come along,
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:52.360]   and all of a sudden you'll realize this never gets stale.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:56.360]   In fact, you will go even deeper.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   All right, so the discussion question for you today is,
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.360]   "How do you make sure repetition doesn't become mindless religious activity?"
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360]   I mentioned some of the stuff.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   Hopefully you guys can have some other things that you can discuss, like practically.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.360]   And then, "At what point does diligently striving turn into legalism?"
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.360]   That's always the struggle that we have, right?
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:23.360]   We want serious discipleship versus compassion and grace,
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.360]   but at what point does passionate pursuit become legalism?
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:35.360]   Sometimes we use the term "legalism" to make excuse for not pursuing righteousness.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.360]   And then sometimes we will pursue the other way.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.360]   We're afraid of licentiousness, so we allow legalism.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.360]   Neither is right.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.360]   The Bible teaches against both, the dangers of both,
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360]   the danger of legalism and the danger of licentiousness.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:01.360]   So how do we make sure that our passionate pursuit of Christ doesn't turn into legalism or licentiousness?
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:08.360]   And then three, "What practical things can you do to help you individually and collectively as a community not to forget?"
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   I mentioned some things that we can do individually, but how do we do it collectively,
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.360]   and maybe specifically in your small group?
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.360]   All right, let me pray for us, and then I'll dismiss you.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:26.360]   There are some guidance I want to give you about the next text, but I'm not going to do it today.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.360]   Just watch for it online. I'm just going to post it up to save time for us here.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   Let me pray for us.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.360]   Gracious Father, we pray that your Spirit would lead our discussion,
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:49.360]   and the things that you've given us already help us to know even in a much more deeper way than we know now.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.360]   Help us to not just be hearers, but to be practicers.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   And we pray, Father God, that you would be gracious to us and allow your Spirit to teach us and lead us
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.360]   and build us up through our small group. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   [Silence]
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:16.360]   [Silence]
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360]   [Silence]
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
