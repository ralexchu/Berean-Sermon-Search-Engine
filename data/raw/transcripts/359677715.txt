[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   All right, everybody.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.480]   If I could get your attention up here, we'll take a moment to pray for God to bless our
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.720]   time in the Word, and then we'll take about 30 minutes to go over the passage.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.720]   Let's pray together.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.480]   All right, God, we want to thank you again.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400]   Lord, we believe that your Word is true.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.200]   And what's more, God, we believe your Word is powerful.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.160]   And I know that all of us have experienced just the sweetness of seeing your truth, having
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.080]   our eyes be opened, and having your Word shed light onto our path.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.640]   God, we are regularly absolutely challenged by your Word.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.840]   And Lord, it is our desire that it would cause us, Lord, to live this life in wisdom, and
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.200]   Father God, to live this life in adherence to your truth.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.440]   Lord, truthfully, that is where it is most difficult.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.360]   A lot of these things, God, we've probably heard in other passages and other sermons.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.960]   But Lord, we do really eagerly pray that your Spirit would cause, every time your Word is
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560]   open to us, your Spirit would cause conviction.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.800]   Your Spirit would cause us to remember.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.600]   And what's more, God, to effectively evaluate and desire to change so that, God, we would
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.240]   be all the more in conformity to your Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.920]   We thank you and pray for your blessing upon our time of study tonight.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   Okay.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.320]   So as we normally do, let's take a moment to read through the passage together.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   I'll read for us.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.040]   Just please follow along.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.360]   And Apostle Paul says, in Philippians here, verse 21, "For to me, to live is Christ and
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.320]   to die is gain.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.960]   But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.760]   And I do not know which one to choose, but I am hard-pressed from both directions, having
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.880]   the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.320]   and joy in the faith, so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   coming to you again.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.080]   Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.720]   come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you are standing firm in
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel, in no way alarmed
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.080]   too from God.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.720]   For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.480]   to suffer for His sake, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.200]   to be in me."
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.500]   Okay.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.840]   As you read this passage, this is an epic one.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.920]   Epic because when you read a verse like, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain,"
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920]   that is such a powerful statement, right?
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.240]   It is one of those all-life-encompassing, even death-encompassing, right?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.200]   Almost like majestic statement that summarizes so much.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.880]   And so we've got to ask, how does Apostle Paul come to this statement?
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.000]   How does Apostle Paul get here?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.720]   Meaning how does he lead up to say something like that?
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.440]   And so one of the things that we typically do in Bible study is to ask, how does this
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.680]   thought even connect with what he said before, right?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   What was in his mind, what was he saying previously that he would say something like this?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.640]   So we take a moment to go back in our Bibles to a previous passage, and I'm just going
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.480]   to read from verse 18 through 20.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.800]   And Apostle Paul said this, "What then?
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.200]   Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.080]   And in this I rejoice, yes, I will rejoice.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.120]   For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.440]   of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.040]   not be put to shame in anything, but that in all boldness, Christ will even now, as
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.440]   always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.440]   And then he says, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.280]   I want to make mention of the fact that clearly his thought from this verse 18 where he says,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.780]   "If Christ is proclaimed, I rejoice.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.160]   This is my desire, it's what I'm looking for."
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.000]   That thought is carried through all the way to verse 20 where he says, "Whether by life
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.440]   or by death, my expectation and my hope is that Christ would be exalted."
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.280]   That thought is carried in verse 21, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.520]   These section headings are not inspired and what you can tell is that actually the paragraph
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.160]   continues to run.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.240]   There isn't actually a break there.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.160]   It's a continuing thought.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.280]   So going back to our verse then, oh no, oh it's that one.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   Okay.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.760]   Going back to our verse then, we can summarize previously Apostle Paul is saying that he
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.080]   is so committed, his number one passion, the desire, you can say the treasure, the goal
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.100]   that he has set in his heart is to see Christ proclaimed and his Savior exalted in his life.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.200]   And no matter what happens to him, that's what's going to be the measure by which he
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.440]   can say, "And all is fine."
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640]   Right?
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.880]   No matter what the circumstances are, he has found a way to make sense of his imprisonment,
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.080]   of the beatings he received, of his privileges taken away.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.120]   There is a way for him to make sense of it all and that making sense of it all is his
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.560]   commitment to see Christ exalted.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.400]   So what's interesting here is right now all I'm doing is making much of this idea that
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.640]   he says, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain," and all I'm saying to you
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.720]   is there is a flow here.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.320]   And my question now then is, what's the connection?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.200]   Is he just reiterating the same thing or is he saying more?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.080]   And what I like to think is, well, he's actually giving us a because statement.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.880]   And the reason why I say it is saying, "Okay, I have as my number one desire the exaltation
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.840]   of Christ," and then he says, "For to me," and when he says that, all he's saying is,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.360]   "Because for me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   This number one eager desire, this passion and hope, this is what is causing him now
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   to not only evaluate this time of suffering or the time in prison, what he's doing is
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.680]   he's evaluating everything, right?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.760]   He's evaluating everything.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.840]   And this is what I like to do.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:40.080]   As I look at verse 22 and 23, is he not doing a evaluation, a pro and con, a kind of measure
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   and balance?
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.760]   "You know, I have this," and what is this?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.580]   "What you got here is option one.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.700]   In option one, I can live on in the flesh," meaning I could stay here, "and what this
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.680]   will mean is fruitful labor," okay?
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   He says, "In this life, I can continue to bear fruit and keep on working the cause of
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.600]   Christ."
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   But number two, he's hard-pressed.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Why?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.920]   Because he's got this also desire to depart, to be with Christ.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.220]   And we know what he means by that is to die.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:24.320]   And he says, "This, however," and look at this, "is much better."
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.760]   If you're highlighting, I'm going to highlight two here, okay?
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.520]   You should highlight this.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   Why?
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.440]   Because when I see this, what I see is a flow of thought where in this first section, verses
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.800]   1 through 26, he gives this pretty incredible statement.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.560]   "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain," and then he involves us or at least
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:57.160]   exposes and reveals his kind of perspective, his thinking through what's good.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.680]   And so, if you look at your handout, I've labeled this point number one, what's good,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   right?
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:11.920]   The perspective, the worldview, to be able to say, "Life and death, I've got a means
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   to evaluate whether it's good or not."
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.240]   And what he says is, "Because for to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain," and he
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.760]   explains it by saying, "As I think about my life, I've got two options and they both have
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.760]   to do with Christ.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.600]   I'm going to be serving him or I could leave."
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.740]   And you know what's really interesting about this?
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:44.780]   He says, "As I think and as I reflect, my conclusion is this is much, much better."
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.060]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.860]   What I am saying to you is he's not only reiterating his desire and saying, "I want to see Christ
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.460]   exalted and I want to continue to suffer and to go to this and this and that."
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.140]   What he's saying is, "I am telling you my worldview, in my perspective, to have Christ
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.700]   is the good I'm seeking."
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:17.220]   Now I'd like to give you an example of this by using a really, really worldly example.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.140]   And the example I'd like to give is my love for minivans.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.260]   Many of you guys who have talked to me, thank you, thumbs up to you, brother.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.940]   Many of you guys who have talked to me before, you know that ever since I was in college,
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:35.100]   so this is when I was between the ages of like 18 and 19, I wanted a minivan and I told
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   everyone.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.100]   Okay?
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.300]   I told every individual that I want a minivan and everybody was like, "Why?"
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.060]   And I'd give them this argument because the minivan is truly the most utility vehicle,
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.540]   even more than your sport utility vehicle.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.300]   I mean, what other vehicle can you put like a queen-size mattress, all your books and
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.260]   your chair and have be fine in your mood, right?
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.700]   What other vehicle can you just open all the doors and have people come in and come out
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.660]   and it's truly the most like versatile vehicle you can purchase.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.420]   And for me as a family guy, I got my two kids, you can put grandpa, grandma in the back and
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.140]   a load of stuff and you're fine, right?
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.820]   Now the other reason why I really like the minivans because there was this moment when
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.460]   I first became Christian as a senior in high school, it was strange but my pastor allowed
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.740]   me to drive the church minivan and it was a Toyota Sienna.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.720]   We packed in all the youth group students and we went to Arizona for a mission trip.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.580]   It was the American, Navajo Indian Reservation and we took like a 26-hour drive.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.740]   I drove the whole thing.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.620]   Now while I was driving, all the students in the car, they get knocked out, they're
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.280]   sleeping and stuff like that.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.860]   People were like they have food crumbs all over the place.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.780]   And as I was driving though, I wasn't thinking like this is the best utility vehicle.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.340]   I was thinking, "Dude, this is awesome.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.860]   We've got our brothers and sisters in the car.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.540]   We're jam-packed in this thing.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.100]   We're going to go do missions."
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.820]   And then I started thinking, "The Sienna is the most godly vehicle."
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.580]   It's the most humble vehicle for sure.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.020]   There's no flaunting this like monstrous thing.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.300]   But it's like the godliest thing possible because we have everybody inside and then
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.300]   I was thinking like, you know, with the push of a button, I could open the door and like
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.900]   serving my people, right?
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.460]   Now I'm just giving you a funny example but think about this, right?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:35.500]   Why would an 18 or 19-year-old student want a minivan and look like a soccer mom?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.340]   See because I had a moment where I had a picture and I thought this is so good, ever since
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.180]   then I've always wanted a minivan.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.420]   Now why do I bring this up?
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.980]   The only reason why we want certain things is because you had a picture in your head
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.180]   this is cool, this is good, this is better.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.960]   And when you conclude that, that is where your desires rise.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.300]   And to the degree that you think that really is good, it's going to match your intensity
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.980]   of desire, right?
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:16.100]   So for Apostle Paul, when he recognizes, "For to me, Christ is better," I want you to
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.220]   understand he's not saying that it's just, you know, it's just better than getting
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.180]   in trouble and all this kind of stuff.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.740]   He's actually saying it's better than life altogether.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.100]   I mean I want you to think about that.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.740]   There is an absolute method to his madness, meaning there's a rationale and reason as
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.900]   to why he would want this.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.020]   Why would you want to walk this path that causes you to go to jail?
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:44.100]   Why would you want to walk this path that causes you grief and hardship?
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.940]   Because he believes this is better.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.820]   And yes, this is better than living a long life and growing old together with the love
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.740]   of your life.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.820]   To him, this is better than living a long life and being able to see your grandkids,
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:03.620]   to live a long, full life where you can leave a legacy and see how, you know, the things
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:08.380]   that you have actually built up and the fortune that you've amassed, you can pass it down
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.660]   and you have this great joy in your heart that you can leave it for the next generations.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.500]   Because think about Apostle Paul.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.020]   What did he have to his name that he could leave for his children?
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.340]   But in my mind, I feel like that's what most people in this generation, that's what they're
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.340]   thinking.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.700]   Just save, save, save, save, save, and you glory in your retirement days.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:33.020]   What you want is to have the privilege to then also leave a legacy for your kids.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.660]   But think about all that.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.780]   Can you by conviction conclude with Apostle Paul, no.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:50.500]   All of life here combined is not even comparable to me being with Christ.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:15:00.260]   His conclusion, and look at this, his conviction, what is he convinced about?
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.740]   What is he so convinced about is his worldview and perspective.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:14.060]   And he is able to discern and judge and conclude this is much better than he's able to commit.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.100]   Then he's able to commit to them, he's able to commit to work, he's able to commit to
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.100]   labor.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.480]   That is the motivating force, right?
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:30.300]   This to him is his motivation for the rest of his ministry, for his confidence that he's
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.340]   going to be able to have fruitful ministry.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:40.140]   And so when we look at this and we see this weird contrast, we have to recognize Apostle
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.180]   Paul's worldview.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.380]   But let's take a moment to think about this just even a little bit deeper because there
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.500]   is a weirdness to it.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.860]   So here, when you take a look at option one versus option two, we think, okay, Apostle
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.400]   Paul's still dedicated to this cause of seeing Jesus exalted.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.640]   He wants to either live so he can be fruitful in labor or he wants to go.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.060]   But the reason why I want to take a moment and cause us to think about it is because,
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.500]   man, what a challenge, right?
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.620]   What a challenge.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.900]   Because if I put myself in Apostle Paul's shoes and I imagine that I hit a wall and
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.820]   people were persecuting me, there are people willing to pick up stones and stone me or
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.880]   people willing to beat me up, right?
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.500]   My struggle would more so be should I keep working or should I quit, right?
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:40.040]   Like my struggle would be should I just close my mouth or should I just keep talking, right?
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.800]   But the strangeness of it all is Apostle Paul was literally in a situation where he is in
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.220]   a life or death situation.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.820]   Because even being in prison, it's not like our prison, before being put in prison, he
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.100]   was beaten, right?
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.300]   What Apostle Paul's wrestling was with, you know, I could actually just keep going, maybe
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:08.800]   even more bombastically preach to the guards, preach to the, you know, the higher officials.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.780]   And what he knows is not so much that like, you know what, I'm just going to kill myself.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.060]   No, he's not thinking about suicide.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.860]   He's thinking about pressing the envelope even more, right?
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:25.300]   Because what he knows is that when he is dedicated to ministry and in this current circumstance,
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.940]   if he goes more, he could literally face death.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.420]   And that to me is quite wild.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:39.620]   To think you literally have these choices and you're willing, like you have that realistic
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.300]   possibility and it's not off the table, right?
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   What a challenge.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Why?
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.500]   Because truthfully speaking, certain things, it's not even on the table for me, right?
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:58.940]   If it means suffering, discomfort, if it means foregoing certain opportunities, foregoing
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.020]   certain privileges, sometimes it's not even option one or option two.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.220]   It's immediately, well, I guess I only have option one, right?
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.160]   Like that's not even an option.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.100]   This is what I'm saying is as we take a moment to observe Apostle Paul even wrestling with
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:18.900]   this, before if you just do a cursory glance over this, you're just like, "Huh, that's
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.900]   kind of funny."
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.220]   You know, maybe he knows he's near his deathbed.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.140]   He just wants it to be over with.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.540]   I don't think so.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.100]   I don't think so.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.100]   Okay.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.620]   So, for the sake of time, I know there's probably a lot of questions here.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.580]   Like, what does he mean by your proud confidence?
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.080]   Confidence in who?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.500]   How does it abound in Christ?
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.900]   And why would they have this kind of confidence in Apostle Paul?
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.940]   Hope you guys can keep talking about that stuff and dig into that, okay?
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:56.740]   But for the sake of time, we're going to move over to point two and take a look at the command.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.460]   Okay?
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.500]   So right here, in my eyes, there were two clear sections of our passage.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.540]   The first connected to the previous passage where he says, basically, "In my life or whether
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.780]   by death, Christ needs to be exalted because for me, Christ is my gain.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.560]   He is to me better.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.380]   Being with him is better than all of life."
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   Right?
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.380]   Summary.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:28.300]   So now, after explaining all that, Apostle Paul gives this powerful command.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.100]   He says, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ."
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:40.700]   Now, whenever I see this, this idea of, I hope this shows up here, manner worthy of
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.700]   the gospel.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.700]   Does that show up?
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700]   Kind of, but not really.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.620]   I'll go back to orange, okay?
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.040]   That shows up.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:58.180]   This idea here of manner worthy of the gospel, that is like such a high, huge, incredible
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.100]   calling, right?
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.620]   And I want to ask you, like, when you hear that, do you just glance over?
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.900]   Do you stop and you're just kind of like, "Whoa."
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.900]   Right?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.100]   You see the magnitude of that.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.100]   Worthy of the gospel?
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:21.020]   Like, you mean, here is the Lord who was in the beginning, who was the sustainer, who
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.100]   like everything came into being through him and he humbled himself and died and you want
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.780]   me to be worthy of that?
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.100]   This is crazy, right?
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.900]   Well, what's really interesting about this is you will see that in other passages, you
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.860]   will see that a lot of times the concept here is not so much that, "Oh my gosh, you're
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.500]   of such amazing stature.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   You deserve it, man."
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   Right?
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   You deserve, that's not what it's saying, right?
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.420]   What he's talking about is in accordance or appropriateness.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:57.860]   So I'm just going to, rather than take too much time to it, in accordance and appropriateness,
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.860]   right?
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:05.140]   For example, another passage that's really common is Ephesians chapter four, verse one.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.940]   He says, "So I urge you, brethren, walk in a manner worthy of the gospel," and what he
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.340]   talks about is, "I just told you about grace and love."
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.340]   So guess what?
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.020]   You need to be gracious and loving.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.900]   You need to be the most humble people ever because the truth of the matter is you don't
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.540]   deserve this, right?
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.740]   So what we're talking about is a kind of, you know, correspondence to the truth of the
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.100]   gospel.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.820]   You know Jesus is on high.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.420]   You know he deserves respect.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.940]   You know you deserve nothing.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.020]   So why in the world are you walking around pomp and prideful and conceited, right?
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.940]   That's typically the kind of exhortation that you see in other books of the Bible where
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:51.620]   it talks about you need to walk in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:22:01.100]   So as we think about this, though, we recognize that, man, this is pretty emphatic here because
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:06.380]   what's really interesting is in chapter one, Apostle Paul used the word "only" to introduce
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   a concept.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   And what was that concept?
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.780]   He was like, "Oh my gosh, what are we to do?
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   I'm in prison.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.380]   There are a bunch of these bad guys out there preaching out of conceit, and they're like,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.740]   you know, pretty much selfish, and they're trying to take this opportunity to even hurt
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   me.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.820]   What should I say then?
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.220]   Should I be like, 'Oh, goodness me,' you know?
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220]   Woe is me."
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.020]   So he says, "Only this, that Christ is proclaimed."
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:37.820]   Synonymously, I want you guys to understand, when he says to walk in a manner worthy of
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.820]   the gospel, I'm asking you to think about these other synonyms.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:50.940]   Are you living in a manner where it is synonymous to only that Christ is proclaimed?
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.340]   You're living in a manner that's pointing to the gospel.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.340]   You're living in a manner upholding the gospel.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.980]   You're living in a manner thankful for the gospel.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.660]   You're living in a manner that is, again, appropriate to what the Lord has done for
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.660]   you.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:11.700]   One of the things that's so convicting was this past weekend we were at a retreat, and
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:18.460]   I talked about like, you know, if your identity is in Christ, you would be a thankful person.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.900]   And yet I was so convicted because, do you know how often complaints come out of my mouth?
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.180]   It's like, "Why is it so hot in here?
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.700]   Why am I so da-da-da-da-da?
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.100]   Why is it so?"
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.620]   And I just feel like we live in a generation where it's almost fun to rant, right?
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.620]   Everybody's like a professional critic.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.460]   And the more like, you know, sharp and more brazen you can get at criticizing something,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.420]   you get more likes or something like that, right?
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.580]   And then you realize like, "Oh my goodness, that is not worthy of the gospel.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:57.660]   It is not even appropriate for an individual to have received such grace, and yet their
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.220]   heart be filled with such complaint," right?
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.940]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:12.780]   Now, as we think about this then, here is an interesting connection here, okay?
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:18.020]   And so again, whenever you guys do observations, I broke it down into these outlines for you
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:24.980]   guys, but the way I do these outlines is always simply by observing these transitions of thought.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.780]   So earlier, if I saw a "for," then I was like, "Okay, this is a new paragraph."
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.340]   Or if I saw "but," then I realized, "Okay, he's contrasting two thoughts."
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.620]   And then over here, when he says, "So that," I got to ask myself the question, "Is this
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.180]   purpose?
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.500]   Is this just simply an effect that he wants to see?
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   What is this?"
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   Right?
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.700]   And this is really interesting, and he says, "I want you to walk in this manner appropriate
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.820]   to the gospel, worthy of the gospel, so that I can see and I can hear this.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:02.380]   Whether I actually come out or whether I don't come out, I want to see and hear this in you."
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.700]   What does Apostle Paul want to see?
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.880]   And whenever you're doing your study and you see a laundry list of stuff, then you want
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.460]   to make sure you highlight that and you count it.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   First, he says, "I want to make sure that you're standing firm in one spirit, with one
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:23.140]   mind, striving together for the gospel."
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.980]   And as we see that, the things that Apostle Paul wants to see, is there any pattern?
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.540]   Is there any kind of emphasis here?
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.260]   And of course we see that.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.380]   We see the term, this kind of military term.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.420]   Yes, you're supposed to be strong, you're supposed to stand against these opponents,
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.580]   and you're supposed to hold your ground, but you're supposed to do that in one spirit,
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.580]   right?
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   You're supposed to have one mind.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.380]   This term literally means soul, okay?
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.540]   One mind, and what you're supposed to be doing with one mind is striving together, that you're
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.580]   actually laboring.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.260]   You're trying and you're putting forth that effort, pursuing what?
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.300]   Greater faith in the gospel, okay?
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.960]   Greater faith in the gospel.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.880]   But I want you guys to think about that for a moment.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:12.080]   What Apostle Paul desires to see is an incredible unity.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.640]   Apostle Paul desires to see an incredible oneness in the church.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.680]   And if you guys know what's coming up, he's going to extrapolate that out to a greater
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.000]   emphasis in chapter two.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.960]   And he's going to say, "This is so important for all of you, that you actually have this
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.800]   unity, not based upon, 'You know what guys, we need to sit down together and just spend
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.440]   some quality time, and we're going to do this week by week, because the more you stay together,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.240]   the more unified we'll be.'"
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.760]   It's not based on quantity of time, is it?
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.520]   Because clearly Apostle Paul doesn't have quantity of time with these people.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.680]   It's not talking about kind of like the solidarity that comes from, "You know, we all happen
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.440]   to be Jewish people.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.320]   We all happen to be X people," whatever it may be.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.880]   "We all happen to be people with the same experiences.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.960]   We all happen to be people with the same kind of educational," you know, whatever, demographics
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   No.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.880]   There has to be a oneness in spirit and a oneness of striving together for the faith
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.240]   of the gospel.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   Why?
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.520]   What's really interesting, he says, "I want to make sure," and I'm going to highlight
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.640]   this in red, "that you not be alarmed," because it's kind of a negative way of saying a very
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   similar thing.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   That doesn't show up.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   All right.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.840]   We're just going to squiggle that.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.920]   To not be alarmed.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.080]   So I want you guys to kind of imagine this, right?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.240]   The whole scenario is Apostle Paul is experiencing persecution.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.720]   And remember his intent was, "I want to basically encourage you but also prepare you by explaining
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.880]   to you how I'm doing and how I'm making sense of this whole scenario, which perhaps you
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.800]   could be really discouraged by," right?
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   Because why?
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.600]   Because Apostle Paul wants to make sure that the church is ready.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.760]   You guys are going to experience the same stuff.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.000]   And we need to continue, just like I already am, to strive for the cause of the advancement
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.480]   of the gospel.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.520]   The only reason why we are here and not up there is because we need to continue to do
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.080]   the work that God has called us to.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   Okay.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.780]   So with that in mind, think about this, right?
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:23.340]   If you were like in the military, or actually, let me use another example.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.700]   Okay.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.540]   Think about two different basketball players.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.540]   All right.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   Hold on.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.820]   Am I getting mixed up in the -- oh, man, I am getting mixed up.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.820]   Sorry.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.820]   Give me a second.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.820]   Oh, no.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.820]   I should have numbered my pages.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.820]   All right.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.820]   Okay.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.820]   Well, let me think for a moment.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.820]   Okay, okay.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.900]   Think about a military scenario, right?
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.220]   As an example, think about a military scenario, and imagine you are the captain.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.540]   And you know you have got to lead this platoon.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.740]   You have got to march these guys over the hill.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:08.500]   And you have got to basically overtake a fortified little machine gun or whatever it may be.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.860]   And you are trying to get these guys ready.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.500]   I want you guys to be sober.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.060]   I want you guys to be alert.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.140]   I want you guys to understand what is happening.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.140]   I know we have already been marching for days, and we are tired, but remember, we need to
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   win this battle.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.620]   We are in this, right?
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.340]   Now you would be so encouraged if everyone was like, that's right, I signed up for this,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.340]   you know.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.660]   But on the flip side, you turn over, and these two bozos are like pointing the gun at each
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   other.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.700]   It is like, man, knock it off, or I will shoot you, you know.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.860]   Or these two guys are completely like surprised, like, oh, they have machine guns, right?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.740]   Like, they are just shocked.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   They have guns, right?
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.400]   Can you imagine?
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   There is no way.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.140]   And then everyone is like, you know what, forget it.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   We are going home, right?
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.460]   Like, there is no way you would continue to advance anything.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.500]   Why do I bring that silly example up?
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.260]   Because you recognize how important unity is.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:05.860]   You recognize how important unity is for any cause, especially a cause so weighty and important
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:12.340]   as the cause of Christ, to exalt His name, to display His glory.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.860]   It is incredible, right?
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:19.660]   And so Apostle Paul makes of such kind of importance that he desires to see this church
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.580]   unified in the Spirit and striving together.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.180]   Okay, moving to the last section here.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:32.580]   Moving towards the last section, I am going to label this point three, which is point
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.620]   three, verse 29 through 30.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:42.820]   This is to us, then, an incredible high calling, a privilege, and a great cause, right?
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.180]   I think I left the blank for you there.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.900]   This is our incredible high calling, our privilege, and great cause.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.540]   Why do I say this?
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:31:01.300]   Well, here what you have is verse 27 to 28.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:07.860]   This is a long sentence all tied together that Apostle Paul desires to see them basically
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:13.020]   ready and prepared, unalarmed by the opponents, right?
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:19.860]   And what's really interesting about this is he says, by motivation, he says, "For to you
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.460]   it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:32.260]   for His sake, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.820]   me."
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.500]   So what you notice there is this.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:44.420]   First, as he thinks about this whole section right here that is a command, and he says,
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.260]   "I want you to conduct yourself like this, and what I want to see in you is this unity,
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.380]   and I want you to be prepared in such a way where your eyes are wide open and you're not
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.100]   surprised by the opponents who are coming at you.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.140]   You're not surprised by the suffering that's coming at you," right?
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:08.820]   Here likewise again, he says, "Because of this, it has been granted to you," okay?
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:16.460]   To not only believe, but to suffer for Christ's sake.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:21.820]   What's really interesting about this is that goes pretty contrary to our instinctual, instinctual
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.140]   reaction to suffering.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.940]   I believe for a lot of people, whenever they're faced with suffering, there is actually a
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.660]   process of trying to make sense of it all.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.660]   Why?
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.820]   Why is this suffering happening, right?
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.260]   And then typically, even if you can't make sense of it, and you're trying to exercise
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.700]   trust in Christ, then you say something like, "You know what?
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.700]   I don't get it.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.660]   I don't know why, but I'm pretty sure that God's going to carry me through it.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.220]   He's going to lead me out of it, and sooner or later, He's going to have an open door,"
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.820]   meaning He's going to deliver me from all this, right?
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.220]   But then think about the kind of perception, think about the kind of perspective Apostle
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.220]   Paul has when he considers that suffering for the sake of Christ is not something that
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.800]   Christ is going to try to take you out of, but He has actually graced you with.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:15.300]   The term for granted is the same word, the verb form of charis, which is grace.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:22.460]   God has gifted it to you that you would believe upon the name of Jesus, but also that you'd
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.340]   be able to suffer for His name.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.500]   Okay?
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:33.420]   Now I think this is where I wanted to use the basketball analogy, okay?
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.300]   I want you to think about this because I think as I was praying for this passage, I realized,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:44.780]   you know, the umph, the conviction of this passage, I'm going to receive it differently
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.580]   based upon who I am and what I want.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:52.500]   I want you to imagine a basketball team, and you have two players, right?
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.620]   The coach, he's got decisions to make.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.620]   Why?
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.780]   Because it's the second overtime of the game, it's already gone forever, the last 30 seconds
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.780]   of the game, and he's got one play to make.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.660]   He's got to make sure he's got the guys in there who know how to make the play and they're
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.340]   clutch.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.780]   He looks at his team, and one of the guys, let's call him Mighty Mark, okay?
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.700]   He's sitting there and he's eager, he's like, "Put me in, coach!"
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.940]   He's just ready to go.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.220]   And so the coach says, "Mark, get in there, man!
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.460]   No reserve, all out on the court, don't save anything, do it, man!"
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.060]   He's like, "Yes!
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.980]   I've been waiting for this!
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.180]   All the training, all the sweat, all the tears, all that money, I'm ready!"
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.500]   And he jumps in there, right?
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.540]   But then this other dude, we'll call him Scaredy Sam, right?
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.780]   He's sitting there like, "Oh my gosh, I hope he doesn't call on me."
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.900]   He pretends like he's about to have a cramp, so he's starting to massage his calf, and
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.740]   I was like, "I don't know!"
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.980]   You know?
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.380]   And the coach comes over and starts walking, and as soon as he starts walking, Scaredy
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.500]   Sam is like, "You know, that guy's got a pretty good jump shot!
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   He's tall!"
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   Right?
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.340]   Because I'm going to be honest, I think when it comes to Christian life, sometimes there
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:16.820]   is not this eager anticipation where we have this excitement like, "Put me in the game!
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.060]   Because I wanted to serve you!
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.900]   I've been looking for opportunities!"
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   Right?
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.940]   I know the whole package of serving you means some discomfort, means burden, typically means
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.100]   some kind of pain, right?
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.580]   Whether it be frustrations, discomfort, or sometimes even physical like this.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.940]   But I'll take it.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.740]   I signed up for this.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.740]   Right?
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:45.140]   As opposed to wondering and sitting back and thinking, "You know, I signed up, I love watching,
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.580]   but man, this is like a high, intense, stressful moment!"
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.580]   Right?
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.740]   That guy can do it.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.680]   Not me, but that guy.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.500]   But I realize as a kind of personal conviction as I read this, I realized, "You know what?
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:06.100]   Based on the condition of my heart, I will read verse 29 really differently."
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.180]   Right?
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.980]   I will read verse 29 really differently.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:16.500]   And I want to leave then, you guys, with that kind of comment, which is, so far, there hasn't
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   been a lot of direct commands.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.660]   It begins in this passage here with verse 27, "Conduct yourself in a manner worthy of the
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.700]   gospel."
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.180]   You know there's more direct commands to come.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.720]   But typically what Apostle Paul does is he inspires us with a perspective.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.980]   And I challenge you, as we pray over this passage, do we have, like Apostle Paul, a
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.820]   kind of worldview, an ability to judge the various circumstances, to make sense of it
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.500]   all and say, "You know what?
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.580]   I'm not going to judge like the world and say, 'You know what?
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.460]   To live is always gain and to die just sucks.'"
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.460]   Right?
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.460]   What a tragedy.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.460]   No.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.180]   But we can actually judge through spiritual eyes.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.780]   No, no, no, no.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.060]   This looks bad, but this is good.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.240]   Christ is exalted.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.940]   Do we have, with spiritual eyes, verse 29, where we can see the various things in our
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.400]   lives, like, "You know what?
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.860]   This is a fat privilege for me."
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860]   Why?
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.180]   Because it's right in line with my cause.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.820]   It's right in line with my passion.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.460]   When we all have that kind of worldview, we're going to have unity.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.420]   We're going to have likeness of mind.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.580]   We're going to have likeness of interpretation.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.100]   We're going to have likeness of perspective, and we're going to have likeness of what is
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.920]   the striving and solution.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.140]   So as a way to just kind of challenge us, by way of conclusion, this specific paragraph,
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.560]   this portion, was a challenge to have the kind of worldview that really is in likeness
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.580]   of one who is serving the Lord.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   Let's pray.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:57.700]   Lord, we do want to thank you again for challenging us.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:03.260]   We do recognize, God, that perhaps sometimes we're confused by the circumstances of our
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.900]   lives, and then, Lord, sometimes we're confused by the desires of our heart.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.300]   Lord, sometimes we just don't know what we want.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:18.160]   But we thank you so much because your Word guides us to want the things that are weighty,
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.100]   to want the things that matter to your heart.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.860]   And I pray, Father Lord, that we would not be so confused and feel like everything is
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.420]   so nebulous, but, God, we would have such a clarity.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:36.700]   We want to live with such clearness of conscience, clarity of vision, of purpose, and what's
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.820]   more, a clarity of what's right.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:47.960]   And I ask God that he would challenge us then to wash away whatever is the muck of the world
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.540]   and God to continue to buy into what you tell us is the right path.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.020]   Lord, we want to thank you again.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.020]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.020]   Amen.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.540]   Amen.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:04.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
