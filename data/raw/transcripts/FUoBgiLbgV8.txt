[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600]   (people chattering)
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.520]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.440]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.360]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.280]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.200]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.120]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:53.040]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.960]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.960]   (soft piano music)
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   (soft piano music)
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.960]   (soft piano music)
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.960]   (soft piano music)
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:43.680]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.480]   Happy Lord's Day, and I hope you all
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.000]   had a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.840]   Scripture says in Colossians 3:12 and verse 17,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.040]   so as those who have been chosen of God,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000]   kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.240]   Whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.800]   do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.880]   giving thanks to him, to God the Father.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.840]   As we begin our service with this song,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.440]   may we give thanks to Jesus, who is our humble King,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.080]   the Lord who sees the broken
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.560]   and is compassionate to the weak and to those in need,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   the Lord who has shown compassion to us.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.120]   And may it be our prayer to desire humility
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.080]   and to be like Jesus in this way.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   (soft piano music)
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000]   (soft piano music)

[00:06:50.900 --> 00:07:01.320]   - All right, good morning.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   Welcome to Brink Community Church.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   We have a bit of announcements before we get started.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   First of all, Pastor Mark announced last Sunday
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   that we are adding a third service to our worship service
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   starting from January 7th.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   Obviously, we're doing that
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   because we're trying to make more space with a growing church.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   And so the service times are 8 o'clock, 9.30, and 11.30 a.m.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   And so we're asking, again, 8 o'clock,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   there is no children's or education department.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   So a lot of the younger people who, you know,
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   where that's not an issue,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   we're asking you to come to the 8 o'clock service.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   And then our main education department is gonna be at 11.30.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   So right now it's at 11,
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   so we're gonna have to postpone that to 11.30.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   And then there's some nursery and just early, K through 2,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   for the second service at 9.30.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   And I know that when we took a survey,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   most of you prefer going to the 9.30 service,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   but we're asking, obviously, the parents,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   you're gonna have to bring your children to the 11.30 service.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   Okay?
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   And then if possible, to choose the 8 o'clock,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   and then the 9.30, again, and most people,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   if you can come to the 11.30 service.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   So, you know, years ago when we added our second service,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   this is more than probably 10 or 12 years ago,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   it took us several years to kind of get comfortable
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   and make sure that we have all the services filled
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   and all of that.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   And so, you know, just be patient with us
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   as we go through the transition,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   and a lot of things have to be changed
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   in order for us to accommodate that.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   We've been looking into different options
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   that we have for the growing church,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   but I think for the time being,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   this is the quickest solution that we have.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   So please mark that on your calendar.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   On January 7th is the first service
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   that we're gonna be doing, 8, 9.30, and 11.30.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   Okay?
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   If you--like, 8 o'clock service, if you notice,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   there's the time between 8 and 9.30 is one and a half hours.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   Between 9.30 and 11.30, there's two hours.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.320]   So those of you who are--been complaining
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.320]   that my sermons are too long,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   8 o'clock service is for you.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   So next time you say, "Hey, your sermon's too long,"
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   I'm gonna say, "8 o'clock for you then," okay?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   'Cause we're gonna try to keep it a little bit shorter
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   in order for us to be able to get the people out
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   and then have 9.30 service.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   So the service is gonna be a little bit shorter.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   We're not gonna be having baptism in that service,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   and so it's--again, if you want to come, okay,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   try to come to 8 o'clock service, okay?
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   FAM 245, if you're part of that ministry,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   if you're been married less than three years,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   there's a bowling fellowship going on
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   on Saturday, December 2nd at 4 p.m.,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   so please sign up for that.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   Family Christmas party,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   family ministry Christmas party.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   So if anyone who's married,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   which is the bulk of our church,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   we haven't had this in a while just because of space,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   but we're trying to implement that, okay?
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   And again, I'm not sure if we're gonna be able
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   to do this again next year,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   but if you can sign up for that,
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   that's happening on December 10th from 1 to 3,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   after second service from 1 to 3.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   There is child care provided.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   The cost is $10 for adults and $5 for children.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   It's gonna be held in the sanctuary as much as possible,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   and then if we have too many,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   depending on how many people sign up,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   there will be overflow room outside, okay?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   Just mark that on the calendar,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   and today is the last Sunday, they say,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   that you can sign up for that.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   Even though it's a couple weeks away,
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   they need to know how to prepare for this,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   so please sign up for that.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   Is there a sign-up table outside?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   Okay, so there is a sign-up table.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.320]   You go outside, either that,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   or you can go online and sign up directly online, okay?
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   Also, New Year's this year is falling on Sunday,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   on December 31st,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   and so we'll have our New Year regular Sunday service,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   and then at nighttime,
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   we have 11 o'clock New Year's Eve service
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   that we have every year,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   so just mark that on the calendar,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   and along with that,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   we have an annual ping-pong tournament that takes place,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   so if you wanna participate in that,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   the cost of it is $5,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   and again, the last day to sign up for that is December 24th, okay?
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   And then for Galatians Bible study,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   we have, I think, three more weeks left for this session, right?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   And then after that, there's a little bit of break.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   There's almost about seven weeks of break,
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   and the next Galatians is gonna start on February 7th,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   so there's a whole month of January is gonna be off,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   and then half of December is gonna be off,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   and so that time is gonna be used to kind of, like,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.320]   meet with the small group leaders
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   and possibly home group leaders,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   and it'll give you a break,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   but we need you guys to sign up even now.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   Even though it's quite a bit away,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   we need to know how many small group leaders,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   home groups that we need to add to this,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   so if you guys are planning to come to the Bible study,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   which we hope you are,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   That'll help us to organize what we need, okay?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   And then one last--
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   we have Living Well Pregnancy Center,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   baby bottle drive,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   so if you've taken one of those,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   you need to turn it in by December 10th, okay?
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   So they need to take it to where they're gonna take it to,
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   but the last day to turn that in is December 10th, okay?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   I think that's it for today.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   Let me pray for the offering,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.320]   and then after the offering,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   after our main worship time,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Justin Yu is gonna come up,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   give his testimony, and be baptized this morning.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   to be able to come and call you our Abba Father,
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   to worship you,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   to thank you, Father God, for your goodness in our lives.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   Help us, Lord, to calibrate our hearts
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   if we've come into this room entangled with civilian affairs.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   Help us, Lord, to live a life truly fixated on Christ,
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   that he would be our all,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   that our worship, Lord God,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   would be an overflow of gratitude
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   that you've placed in our hearts.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   Help us, Lord God, to fight against a sense of duty,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   fight against, Lord God, just rote behavior,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   that you would search our hearts, know us,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   and that you would sanctify us, call us,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   that whether it is in giving, worshiping,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   or even in listening of your word,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   that may it all cause us, Lord God,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320]   to be greater worshipers who worship you
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   Bless the offering that we give, Lord,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   may it be multiplied for your use.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:17.160]   - Let us all rise and before we continue on the service, if we could spend a few moments
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.740]   to greet the neighbors around us.

[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:55.740]   [Music]
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.740]   I'd like to read from Philippians chapter 2 verse 9, line 2, 11.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.500]   "For this reason also God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.540]   every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.500]   and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.740]   is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:27.740]   [Music]
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.740]   Let's sing, "All hail."
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   All hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:53.740]   Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:05.740]   Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:13.740]   [Music]
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:24.740]   He comes in seed of Israel's grace, he ransomed from the fall.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   Hail him who saves you by his grace and crowned him Lord of all.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:50.740]   Hail him who saves you by his grace and crowned him Lord of all.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   [Music]
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:09.740]   Let every kindred, let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial hall.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:35.740]   To him all majesty ascribe and crown him Lord of all.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:41.740]   [Music]
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:54.740]   Oh that with yonder, oh that with yonder sacred throng, we at his feet may fall.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   We'll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   We'll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:31.740]   [Music]
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   Romans 11 verse 33 goes, "Oh the depths of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways."
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:58.740]   [Music]
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:07.740]   You are beautiful, you are beautiful beyond description.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:20.740]   Too marvelous for words, too wonderful for comprehension.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   Like nothing ever seen or heard.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   Who can grasp your infinite wisdom? Who can fathom the depths of your love?
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:54.740]   You are beautiful beyond description. Majesty enthroned above.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   I stand, I stand in awe of you. Lord I stand, I stand in awe of you.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:20.740]   Holy God to whom all praise is due. I stand in awe of you.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:30.740]   [Music]
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:39.740]   You are beautiful, you are beautiful beyond description.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   Yet God blessed you for my sin.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:58.740]   Agony, deep affliction. Cut off that I might enter in.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:12.740]   Who can grasp such tender compassion? Who can fathom your mercy so free?
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:24.740]   You are beautiful beyond description. Lamb of God, you died for me.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   I stand, I stand, I stand in awe of you. Lord I stand, I stand in awe of you.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   Holy God to whom all praise is due. I stand in awe, I stand, I stand in awe of you.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:16.740]   I stand, I stand in awe of you. Holy God to whom all praise is due. I stand in awe of you.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:29.740]   [Music]
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.740]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:48.740]   [Music]
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   Good morning church, my name is Justin Yu.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   I'm currently a junior attending California State University Long Beach.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:02.740]   Now you may find that my testimony starts much like many of yours.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:10.740]   I grew up in a Christian household, attending church every Sunday and participating in Vacation Bible School, otherwise known as VBS.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:17.740]   My family and I would do the typical things like pray before meals and live according to Christian values.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:24.740]   However, throughout all of this I failed to understand what being a Christian truly meant.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.740]   In the years before college, I can say that my life appeared good from a worldly perspective, but it lacked a connection with Christ.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:38.740]   Throughout my middle school and high school years, I was constantly controlled by my own heart.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.740]   This led me to live a life full of sin, greed, and hate.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   I continuously lied, stole, and gave into my lustful desires, believing the things of this world would satisfy me.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:59.740]   During those times, I would often feel regret and helplessness, and almost every day I was plagued with depression and loneliness.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   In high school, I took pride in proclaiming myself a Christian.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:11.740]   My friends would often call me "the Christian boy" because I refrained from swearing and participating in their activities.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   I took pride in this, believing that I was holier, better, and just.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.740]   I made many things into idols, including tennis, video games, and people.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.740]   However, deep down, my actions were never truly aligned with my faith in Christ.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.740]   I was one of those Christians who knew of God, but never truly knew God.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:38.740]   A Sunday Christian, someone who appeared devout on Sundays, but lived differently the rest of the week.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:45.740]   Despite this, deep in my heart, there was still a curiosity and a desire to know more.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:52.740]   When the pandemic hit, I became harboring self-hatred and convinced myself I was a failure in all aspects.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.740]   During my junior year, I would constantly compare myself to my friends' academic achievements.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   This feeling of inadequacy and isolation intensified.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.740]   Senior year brought further challenges, with college rejections.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:13.740]   These setbacks devastated me, and I remember I would plead with God nightly, questioning why I seemed to be failing.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   I grew resentful towards God for not making me smarter and making life seemingly harder for me.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   I ignored my own gifts and fixated on what I lacked.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   Throughout all of that, though, a verse that resonated with me at the time was Isaiah 40, 29.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.740]   "He gives strength to the weary, and to him who lacks might, he increases power."
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:41.740]   Despite frequently repeating this verse, I needed help to internalize its message.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   As my life continued and I entered college, that desire grew to a point where I was desperately searching for a Christian community.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   Through God's grace and his plan for me, I found Asian American Christian Fellowship, AACF,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   where I encountered God's love and his promises for me.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:10.740]   For the first time in my life, I found a group of people who were all seeking to understand what it truly meant to be a Christian and have real faith.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.740]   As I spent countless hours with them, I began to grasp the true meaning of placing all of our hope in Christ.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:24.740]   My desire to know Christ grew exponentially, and I frequently found myself turning to the Lord with my struggles and sins.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.740]   Every day, I began to witness God's mercy and blessings in my life.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:36.740]   My perspective on the Bible shifted from "How does God's word relate to me?" to "How can I apply God's word in my life?"
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:44.740]   Through this transformation, I came to realize that Jesus is, indeed, my Lord and Savior, and I am utterly dependent on him and his strength.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   Over time, I gained a clear understanding that Jesus died and suffered, bearing all my sins, but rose again, defeating death.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   By putting my dependence on Jesus, I have learned what it truly means to repent and turn towards him.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:04.740]   This newfound reliance and acceptance of God has made me more intentional in my interactions with everyone around me.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:11.740]   I walk alongside my brothers and sisters in their spiritual journeys, being poured into and pouring out to those around me.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:22.740]   I can say that I have grown in my desire to read the word, not for personal improvement or knowledge acquisition, but because I desire a deeper relationship with Christ.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:29.740]   In prayer, I now understand all the gifts and blessings he has provided for me, which I was previously ignorant of.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:36.740]   Thus, over the past three years, I have learned what it truly means to surrender everything to him.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   As Matthew 16, 24-25 states, "If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:53.740]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:04.740]   While I am still in the process of learning and growing in my faith, I hope to share the love and joy that God has bestowed upon me with others, and in the end, glorifying him.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:11.740]   Reading the Bible has transformed from a chore to an enriching experience, and as my testimony continues to evolve each day,
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   I may not fully comprehend God's plan for me, but I have learned to place my trust in him, recognizing that his truths transcend my own understanding.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.740]   I have found joy and satisfaction through the Lord, and I couldn't be more glad.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   And so today, I am getting baptized to proclaim to the whole world that Jesus is my Lord and Savior. Thank you.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:43.740]   [Applause]
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:57.740]   Listen, do you understand when you go into the water, you are being united with Christ's death, and when you come out, you are being united to his resurrected life?
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.740]   I do.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:16.740]   [Applause]
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.740]   All right, thank you, Justin, for that encouraging testimony.
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 6, verse 46 through 49.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.740]   Luke chapter 6, verse 46 through 49.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   Reading out of the NASB, it says, "Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:43.740]   Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:54.740]   And when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly is like a man who built the house on the ground without any foundation.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:07.740]   And the torrent burst against it, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great."
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   Let's pray.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.740]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.740]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us, that we may understand more than just your words, Lord God,
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   that we would understand your heart.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   I pray that you will bless us and guide us and teach us.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.740]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   I want to introduce three books to you.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:34.740]   We call them core books of our church, and those of you who have been at our church for a while already know what they are.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.740]   At the beginning of the church, probably the first 10 years of the church, this was a mandatory reading in our church.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   And so after you took membership, we made sure that every single person in our church read this in small groups.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:51.740]   And the reason why I want to introduce them to you is because of the size of the church and growth of the church,
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   we weren't able to keep track, but we highly encourage you guys to read this.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   The reason why there's only three, there's many good books to read,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.740]   but the reason why we chose these three as the foundational books for our church is that if you don't understand it,
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:12.740]   or if you disagree with it, you're going to have a problem or have a difficult time accepting why we do what we do.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.740]   What is the reason behind that?
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.740]   So I want to introduce you to these three books.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.740]   First one is The Holiness of God.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   This is from R.C. Sproul.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.740]   And our first vision in our church is God-centered worship.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:33.740]   And basically what that means is our primary purpose of gathering is not to make sure that your felt needs are taken care of,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   that you have the best experience in the church as possible.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   That's not our primary goal.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:45.740]   We're hoping that it would be a byproduct of what we do, but our primary goal is how do we honor God?
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.740]   How does he desire to be worshipped?
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.740]   Where it's God-centered.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.740]   Every decision that we make, every value that we have is God-centered.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   So what this book teaches is about his holiness.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.740]   God established all throughout the Old Testament, even before Christ comes to be sacrificed,
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.740]   they needed to understand who God is.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.740]   In order to understand why Jesus had to do what he had to do.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.740]   And so if we have a misunderstanding of who he is, or lack of understanding of who he is,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.740]   and because of that we have an incomplete understanding of where we stand with God,
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   then everything that we do from that point on isn't going to make sense.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   It's like kind of pouring water into a bucket that has a hole in it.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   So this book helps us establish that, the holiness of God.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.740]   The second book is from MacArthur, "Gospel According to Jesus."
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.740]   And this book basically goes over lordship salvation.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.740]   Meaning that the main reason why I'm introducing these books is because of the topic that we're talking about today,
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.740]   is about lordship.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:48.740]   And so once we understand our salvation in light of that we've rebelled against God,
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:54.740]   and God restores us, that we may come under submission again to worship a holy God.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   And then "Gospel According to Jesus" is, salvation isn't simply that he erased the penalty of our sins so that we can live life freely.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   According to the scriptures, that God saves us, that we may again serve a new master.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.740]   We were at once slaves to sin, but now he made us slaves to righteousness.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:22.740]   And so this book helps us to understand, going scripture passage by passage, what lordship salvation looks like.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:30.740]   Lordship is not mandated in scripture for justification, but true saving faith will always lead to Christ as Lord.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.740]   And so that's what this book is about.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.740]   And then the third book is "The Master's Plan for the Church."
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   And so this is like, if Christ is our Lord, where does that get expressed?
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.740]   Primarily through the church.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:51.740]   A Christian who says that Christ is Lord, and who does not understand or practice lordship in the context of the church,
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.740]   is outside the body of Christ.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.740]   You can say, you know, I have this personal relationship with God, but if you look at the scripture carefully,
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.740]   where the expression of our relationship with God is expressed is primarily through the church.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   So everything that we do is to be done through the church, whether it's homeless ministry, whether it's through missions,
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:18.740]   whether it's outreach, community, family building, all of it was given to us that we may practice this within the context of the church.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.740]   And so this book helps us to understand that.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:25.740]   So this is the reason why we've introduced this book at the very beginning of our church,
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.740]   in order to help disciple our church to make sure that we're on the same page.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.740]   If you come with a different view, or maybe, "Hey, I don't agree with some of that."
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   And one of the main reasons why you may listen to something and then say certain decisions that are being made,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.740]   "Why do we have to do it that way?" is because either you don't understand this,
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.740]   or maybe you are in disagreement with some of the stuff here.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:52.740]   Again, I say all of this because we're looking at a text where Jesus is calling out people who are calling him Lord, Lord,
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   and yet not practicing. In other words, it was just lip service.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   In Acts 2.36, it says, "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God had made him both Lord and Christ."
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:12.740]   This Jesus whom you crucified, he was made to be Lord and Christ.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:18.740]   He's not just our Savior. The reason why he's our Savior is because him saving us from our sin
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:26.740]   establishes him as Lord over our lives. So you cannot call Christ your Savior if he is not your Lord.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   Romans 10.9, it says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord,
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:36.740]   and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.740]   When he says, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord,"
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.740]   obviously he's not saying people who say those magical words.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:48.740]   If you speak English and you happen to put those words in a sentence, that somehow magically you're saved.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:54.740]   Obviously that's not what he's saying. He's saying somebody who establishes and recognizes Christ's Lordship over them.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.740]   That it is no longer your life to live, but that you and I have been purchased by the blood of Christ, so now we belong to him.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:05.740]   And so he says, "He who confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:10.740]   and believe in your heart that he was crucified and raised from the dead,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   in order to establish him as Lord," he says, "he will be saved."
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.740]   This morning we're going to be looking at this text of verse 46 to 49.
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   There's three things about Lordship that I want to talk about.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.740]   One is that Lordship requires more than lip service.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:31.740]   Second, Lordship requires coming, hearing, and doing his word.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.740]   And third, Lordship ultimately will be tested.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.740]   So first of all, Lordship requires more than simple lip service.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.740]   Verse 46 says, "Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?"
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.740]   One of the questions that I asked on Facebook last night,
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.740]   if you don't know, I put up questions there before I come so that you'll be familiar with the text,
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   so that the text that we're going to be looking at will make more sense to you.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   And the question that I asked is, "Why does he repeat himself and say, 'Those who call me Lord, Lord'?"
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.740]   The reason why things are said in repetition in the New Testament is for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   So when Jesus has something very important to say to Peter, what does he say?
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.740]   "Peter, Peter." "Simon, Simon." He's not stuttering.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:24.740]   That's the New Testament way to get your attention, pay attention.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.740]   When he had something really important to say, what would he say?
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   "Truly, truly I say to you," for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   Not to say that everything else he's saying is not important, but he's saying pay attention.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:40.740]   If you're just kind of haphazardly listening to what I'm saying, you're going to miss the point.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.740]   So when he says, someone who says to me, "Lord, Lord,"
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:50.740]   he's not referring to somebody who's just passively saying, "Oh, Lord, you're my teacher, you're my director, you're my pastor,"
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.740]   or whatever that first century Jews would have said.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   He's talking about people who are convinced that he is Lord.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:06.740]   "Lord, Lord." They were absolutely confident that if you asked them, "Where do you stand with God?"
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   He said, "He's my Lord."
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   So when he's saying, "Why do you call me Lord, Lord?"
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   He's not referring to necessarily simply people who are just kind of saying it haphazardly.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.740]   They're convinced themselves.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   "No, he is my Lord."
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   There's many people in the church who are absolutely convinced that they've done something and said something
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:33.740]   at some point in their lives and they're absolutely convinced that I'm a follower of Christ.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.740]   He's referring to those people.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   "Why do you call me Lord, Lord and do not do what I say?"
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   In other words, it's simple lip service.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   You mean it in your heart, but it's not being done.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.740]   Selective obedience is disobedience.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:58.740]   These are people who may be obedient or at least going through and picking and choosing what is beneficial to them,
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.740]   what they like and don't like.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:05.740]   And so as a result of that, the very core things that God desires of them, they don't obey.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:11.740]   I think a good example for this, illustration of this, is again, if I was to, you know,
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.740]   me and Esther was to leave the home and say, "Hey, we're going to leave you $1,000 to my oldest son
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.740]   and say this money is given to you so that you can take care of your siblings."
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   Then after, you know, a month goes by, I come back and I find out that he used that money for himself.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   I said, "What did you do with that money?"
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:34.740]   He said, "Well, you know, I made sure, you know, that the house was clean, the trash was taken out,
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.740]   and I made sure that they slept."
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   But he said, "No, I'm not asking you that.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.740]   I'm asking you what you do with the $1,000 that I gave you."
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.740]   He said, "Well, I went to school.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.740]   I made sure we did the homework."
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.740]   And he said, "Well, you may have done all of that, but the central thing that I asked you to do
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.740]   is use that money for your siblings, but you did not."
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:00.740]   Many people who call me Lord, Lord are not disobedient to everything.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   They're just selective as to what they choose to obey.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.740]   In Matthew 23, 23-25, Jesus says to the Pharisees and the scribes,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.740]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.740]   For you tithe mint and dill and cumin and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.740]   justice and mercy and faithfulness, but these are things you should have done
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.740]   without neglecting the others."
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.740]   The problem wasn't with their giving.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.740]   The problem wasn't with the other things that they were doing.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:34.740]   It's just that you chose to highlight the things that are easier to do, but the weightier matters.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   The matters that he was just talking about in the previous text, to love your enemies,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   to practice the kind of love that Jesus practiced with us.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.740]   When it comes to the weightier things, you say, "Well, but I gave this and I've done that."
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.740]   But when it comes to the central thing that I asked you to do, you said you neglected it.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.740]   You blind guides who strain out the net and swallow the camel,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.740]   woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.740]   For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish,
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   but inside they are full of robbery and of self-indulgence.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:12.740]   You know, in the Old Testament, God wanted to make sure that lordship was properly established.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:20.740]   And so he embedded into the law of Israel the tithing.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   And tithing was specifically tied to recognition of lordship.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   And in tithing, he said, "Not at the end, not after you've done all the harvest
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.740]   and you've used all your money, and then see whatever is left over and to give to him."
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.740]   He says, "No, in the first fruit."
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.740]   To recognize first and foremost, before you did anything else,
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   you need to recognize that this belongs to God, this is not yours.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:49.740]   And that whatever it is that you have left over, it is to use to glorify God.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.740]   But if you refuse to recognize God in the beginning,
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.740]   you for sure not recognize God in the middle or at the end.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   And so that's why he embedded this into the law.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.740]   And some people say, "Well, you know, in the New Testament, we're not commanded to do this."
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.740]   And you're absolutely correct.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.740]   The word tithing is not used in the New Testament.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.740]   It says to give generously, but it's not used in the New Testament.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.740]   But neither is membership.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.740]   Neither is Wednesday Bible study or home group.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:24.740]   Or going out to certain countries to do missions or reading certain type of books.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.740]   None of these things are commanded.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   But these are principles taught in the Old Testament that we are to follow.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.740]   Now, the reason why I mention this in my sermon is not going to be about giving.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.740]   But this is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.740]   Where we can establish Christ as Lord in every other part of our lives except for money.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.740]   But money is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:50.740]   Money represents our time, it represents our energy, it represents our heart.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:59.740]   So when we refuse to establish Christ as Lord in our finances, you refuse to establish Christ as Lord, period.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.740]   I want to establish Christ in the areas that I can give.
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.740]   I don't want to do this and I want to serve here.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.740]   But the thing that matters the most to you, you want to retain control.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.740]   And that's why God told him, "Among your first fruits, what is the most important to you?"
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.740]   The thing that you value the most.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   He says to give as an act of obedience, to surrender.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:30.740]   Why do you call me Lord, Lord and yet your actions are not consistent?
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   Calling him Lord doesn't make him Lord.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.740]   If he is Lord, he says to do what I say.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.740]   In verse 47, it tells us three things.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.740]   Three things that a true disciple of Christ ought to do.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:49.740]   He says, "Everyone who comes to me and hears my word and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like."
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.740]   There's three things that he says.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   One, to come.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   To come to Christ.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.740]   In Matthew 11, 28, 30, he says, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.740]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:13.740]   and you will find rest for your soul, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:21.740]   If you come to church looking for friendship and community and certain activities,
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.740]   and yet you are not any closer to Christ than the first day that you met,
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.740]   you missed the whole point of this gathering.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   The calling of the church is not to call and gather as many people as possible in the church.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.740]   People who are good, people who are moral, people who vote for the right party.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   That is not the ultimate goal of the church.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:49.740]   Jesus called us to himself, to him.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:55.740]   I remember years ago, I had a friend who left this huge mega church,
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.740]   and he was so high on this church in the beginning,
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.740]   but after a few years, he decided to leave, and I asked him, "What caused you to leave?"
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.740]   He said, "After a couple of years, I realized that he wasn't on the same page."
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:12.740]   I asked him, "What happened?" He was a part of a youth group staff in this large church,
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:17.740]   and he said that their desire was to attract as many people, seekers as possible,
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.740]   so they set up Xbox all over the area.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:28.740]   They invited the youth kids to come, obviously because they get to play Xbox.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.740]   They would play. While the parents were having worship, they would come and play.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:38.740]   Then after 40 or 50 minutes of playing Xbox, the last 5 to 10 minutes,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.740]   some youth pastor would stand up and say, "Isn't Jesus awesome?
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.740]   Isn't this the kind of church you want to go to?"
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.740]   Initially, he said he tolerated thinking that, "Oh, they're going to come. Maybe they'll hear the gospel."
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.740]   Then he realized that the people who were coming were only coming for Xbox,
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.740]   and they never transitioned to wanting Christ.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.740]   If you attract them with chocolate, you have to keep giving them chocolate.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   So he eventually ended up leaving.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.740]   I heard of another church. In order to cause the church to grow, they were raffling off a car.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.740]   If you brought somebody, you get to drop your name into the bucket,
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.740]   and then if the person who came also puts their name out in the bucket,
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.740]   at the end of the year, all the names of the people who brought people,
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.740]   and all the people who were brought, they get into a box and they pick.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:31.740]   The guy who brought them and the new person that came, they brought a car.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   They got a car.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:39.740]   So it's like, "Why not?" If that's what's going to save them, and that was their logic.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.740]   I know another church.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.740]   I know about this because we had non-Christians who were falling out of that church.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.740]   Non-Christians.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.740]   I said, "Why did you come?"
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.740]   He said, "I was at a church where they were doing evangelism dance parties."
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   So they would open up a room and get a DJ to play all the music that's on the radio.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.740]   At the end of this dance party, two, three hours of strobe lights and all this stuff,
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   and at the end, they would turn off the light before they lock up the church,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   and they'd say, "Isn't this the type of church you want to come to?"
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   And that was it. And then they would go home.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   So non-Christians were disturbed by that and said, "I'm not sure. I don't know much about the Bible.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.740]   I don't know what the Old Testament and New Testament is, but something sounds strange there."
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:30.740]   So they started falling out, and so that's how I found out about it.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:35.740]   If Christ is not what draws you to the church, you're coming to the church for the wrong reason.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.740]   The church will disappoint you.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:44.740]   If the refuge you find is in community, the community eventually is going to disappoint you.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:50.740]   If you're trying to find life with people who are like you so that you can do things together,
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.740]   travel together, you can raise children together,
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:59.740]   these are all benefits of being in a community that is centered on Christ.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.740]   But if Christ is not who you are coming to,
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   if Christ is not the reason why we gather, then you missed the whole point of our gathering.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.740]   Jesus says in John 7, 34, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast,
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   Jesus stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.'"
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.740]   Right now, in our generation, biblical counseling has taken off.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.740]   They've been around for a while, but biblical counseling has taken off.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:36.740]   When I was in China, whether it's in Taiwan and even in India and Korea, people are looking for counselors.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   Now, not all counseling are the same, but they're looking for counselors because it's become trendy to seek counselors.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:48.740]   I'm having anxiety. I'm having relational problems. I feel lonely, need purpose, and seeking counselors.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.740]   So I think it's great. I think biblical counseling is great,
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:56.740]   and that's something that we're trying to push at our church as well.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   But if counseling is nothing more than seeking somebody who is older and mature to say certain things,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:09.740]   to show love to you, and yet you have not moved any closer to Christ at the end of the counseling,
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.740]   that counseling was useless.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   Because all you did was put a Band-Aid on somebody, somebody who's lonely.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.740]   Temporarily, you feel lonely because somebody cares for you.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   Ultimately, everything that we do at church, whether it's Bible study, worship, or prayer meetings,
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.740]   everything that we do is so that you may come to Christ.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:38.740]   If you come to church and you don't have a single friend at church, and you feel alone, and yet you are meeting Christ,
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:44.740]   then the purpose of the church has been fulfilled.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.740]   The purpose of the church is not so that you can have many friends in a community.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.740]   All these things are great. Hopefully, you do have that.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.740]   But the purpose of the church is to bring you to Christ.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:50:00.740]   Revelation 22, 17, "The spirit of the bride say, 'Come,' and let the one who hears say, 'Come,'
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   and let the one who is thirsty, 'Come,' let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost."
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:18.740]   You know, some of the most dangerous people in the church are people who love the church, but do not love Christ.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:22.740]   The most dangerous people in the church, the most dangerous leaders in the church,
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   are people who love the church, and the purpose of the church, the goal of the church, yet do not love Christ.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:35.740]   Because our ultimate goal is different. How we evaluate what is good and bad is different.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:38.740]   What we should or should not do, our priority is different.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:44.740]   Because the whole priority of the church is to bring you to Christ.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   First and foremost, people who are true disciples of Christ are not simply people who give lip service,
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.740]   but people who are seeking Christ.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   Secondly, he must be a hearer, a listener.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:06.740]   You know, people, you can come to church all your life, right, and gain knowledge,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.740]   but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:16.740]   So every year, you're hearing, every week you're hearing, you're hearing, hearing, but you're not listening.
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   You ever try to have a conversation with somebody who's not listening?
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   They're looking at you, right, but they're not listening.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   You know, what I found out is, children, you can tell right away if they're not listening or not, right?
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.740]   I've been to youth camps that felt like purgatory.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.740]   I mean, these kids just don't care, and they'll tell you, right?
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.740]   I remember I was at a youth retreat at a large church in L.A., and my sermon went a little bit long,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   and I said, "You know, I'm going to finish here," and one of the kids said, "You said that already!"
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.740]   And if they're tired, they're just going to lie down, so I know if they're paying attention or not paying attention.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:02.740]   But as you get older, people are a little bit more sophisticated, right?
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.740]   For all the students, it's a little bit easier, too, because you don't have a good poker face yet, right?
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.740]   You can tell, and some of you who don't pay attention, you're sleeping.
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.740]   You have two modes. Either you're paying attention or you're going to sleep, right?
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.740]   So you're not as good, but the older you get, your poker face gets much better,
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:27.740]   and I realize the older you are, the more good at staring at something, and yet there's nothing going through, nothing,
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.740]   and you can tell, right?
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.740]   If you try to have a conversation with somebody who's really not listening,
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:39.740]   they're face towards you, but they're not listening, especially in our generation.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:46.740]   We're so distracted with our phones and so many things, like even if, even like five minutes of silence, something has gone wrong.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.740]   I remember years ago, you know, obviously this is before cell phones.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:54.740]   I had a, my friend invited me to come and preach at his church, and I was sitting among the congregation,
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:01.740]   so they didn't know I was the speaker, and as they were leading praise, they were flipping through magazines.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.740]   So you can tell that this was a long time ago, right?
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.740]   They're flipping through a magazine, and I'm sitting there. The worship is going on.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   It's like they have no interest whatsoever, and I looked around to see how many people were paying attention,
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:18.740]   and very few people were even worshiping, and the whole time I was thinking, "Wow, I'm going to spend the next 30, 40 minutes preaching to them.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.740]   No one's going to listen."
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:29.740]   So I get up there, and I'm about to preach, and I'm looking at the crowd to see how many people are actually even interested in what I have to say before I started.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   Parents are in the back playing with their children, and I could tell that, you know, they're saying,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:40.740]   "Oh, it's a little child was starting to walk," and everybody was clapping in the middle of the sermon.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   So most of the parents were in the back playing with their kids, distracted, and the people who didn't have children were flipping through magazines,
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:55.740]   and I could have just said, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," and no one would have even noticed because they weren't paying attention.
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:54:06.740]   Many people in our generation listen to the Word of God like they're listening to an airline stewardess giving instructions of an emergency, right?
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.740]   So I was just on a plane just last week, and as soon as—before they take off, I was like,
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:18.740]   "Ladies and gentlemen, before we take off, let me go through their emergency procedure," and they'll go through this spiel, right?
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:24.740]   And everybody just clicks off, especially if you've been—you've traveled quite a bit, and you know what they're going to say.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:32.740]   So that's when I put in my earplugs, and I close my eyes, you know, and I go to sleep, and then when they're done, I'll wake up, right?
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:42.740]   But in order to get people to pay attention—so they'll make jokes, they say silly things, or they'll make a recording of BTS, you know what I mean, do a dance thing.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:48.740]   It's like, "Oh, put the mask on first," you know, because people are not paying attention, right?
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   And part of the reason why people don't pay attention is because they've heard it so many times,
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:59.740]   and the other reason why they don't pay attention is because they don't expect an emergency to happen.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   So as a result of that, you click off. This is not important.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:08.740]   But if they knew, let's say if there's a 50% chance, even a 10% chance, let's say 5% chance,
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.740]   that there was a chance that this is going to hit the water, and you're going to need these instructions,
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:17.740]   even if you heard it a thousand times, you'll be paying attention.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   That's exactly what Jesus says about the ten virgins.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:28.740]   Before the bridegroom comes, it's like, "Oh, he's not going to come. It's been so long, and they weren't paying attention. They weren't prepared."
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:35.740]   And Jesus said, "Those who recognize the urgency of this, and those five virgins who are ready,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:40.740]   when the bridegroom comes, that they will enter into eternity."
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:47.740]   So much of our church, especially if you've been to church for a while, what haven't you heard?
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   You probably memorized it. You probably taught it.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.740]   You grew up in the church, so after a while, you just kind of turn off.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   So you just put in your time, and then check in and check out.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   But you're not listening. You're not actually paying attention.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:07.740]   In fact, that was the exact problem with the disciples that Jesus was teaching them.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   And as he was headed toward the cross, he's talking about his death and resurrection.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   Remember what the disciples were saying?
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:16.740]   Jesus said, "Clearly, I'm going to go into Jerusalem. The leaders are going to catch me.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.740]   They're going to crucify me, and I'm going to die. On the third day, I'm going to resurrect."
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   And they were all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.740]   So tell me who's going to sit on your left and who's going to sit on your right?
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.740]   And they kept on asking the same questions.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   So when Jesus was going to the cross, it's like, "What is he doing?"
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.740]   If they paid attention, Jesus was not speaking in parables.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.740]   He made it very clear this is what's going to happen.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:44.740]   But when it actually happened, they're like, "What is he doing?"
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:50.740]   In fact, they were so oblivious that after Jesus was resurrected, they're like, "What? How can he resurrect?"
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:57.740]   Jesus has told you this was going to happen because they've been so inoculated.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:04.740]   They were so fixated on their own glory that what Jesus said didn't make sense.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:10.740]   John 5.24, it says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.740]   has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has passed out of judgment into life."
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.740]   He who hears my word.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.740]   He's not just talking about somebody who's come to church and listened to sermons.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.740]   You all have years.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   Obviously, that's not what he's talking about.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.740]   He's somebody who's attentive, recognizes the urgency of what it has to say,
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:35.740]   who's paying attention, who's coming to the Lord and saying, "Search me and know me.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.740]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me."
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:44.740]   Searching the scriptures to see the judge of thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   The first of the Ten Commandments is, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.740]   That's easy. Don't worship any other gods but God.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.740]   But the second commandment is, "Do not make any graven images of me and worship it."
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:01.740]   At a superficial glance, it looks like the same commandment.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.740]   Don't worship any other god.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:10.740]   But the second commandment is so practical because the tendency of Israel was,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   if Yahweh was telling them to do things that they didn't want to do,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   or maybe Yahweh was not answering their prayer and not enough rain was coming,
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.740]   or they didn't have as many children as they wanted,
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:29.740]   they made an image of Yahweh into a calf and then began to worship it and said,
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:33.740]   "This is Yahweh who delivered us."
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:38.740]   And they would begin to form Yahweh into the image that they want God to be.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   How often do you hear people say when they don't like to hear,
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:48.740]   we say something that they don't like and they say, "Well, that's not the God that I know."
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.740]   The God that I know would never permit that.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.740]   The God that I know would be okay with that.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:58.740]   But they know nothing of God because the God that they know isn't from scripture.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:05.740]   The God that they've created is a God that would tolerate and would be perfectly okay
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.740]   for you to pick and choose what you're going to do and not do.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:14.740]   So they've created a God of their own image.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:19.740]   And then the third commandment is not to use His name in vain.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   That once you've created a God that will tickle the ears of sinners
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   and you begin to propagate that God, you are using the Lord's name in vain.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:36.740]   That's why it's so important that anybody who stands to preach the Word of God,
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.740]   that we're not simply expositing the Bible.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   Because let me tell you, I can choose to expose the Bible
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   and week after week after week say exactly what I want to say.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   I just need to find the text to say it.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.740]   I don't know if that makes sense to you, but those of you who ever preach regularly
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   know exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   I can take the text and say exactly what I want to say.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.740]   So if I'm frustrated with you, right, every text is going to turn into,
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   "What is wrong with you people? God is angry with you. God is going to judge you."
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   I can choose to do that every single week.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.740]   Or I don't want you to be angry with me.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   So I can take every text, exposit it in a way, "God loves you.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   He's so gracious to you. He loves you. He's so patient with you.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   There's nothing you can do."
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   If I don't judge the thoughts and intentions of my heart,
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:42.740]   I can easily use the Lord's name in vain through the Scripture.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.740]   Through the Scripture.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   That's why this is such a tricky thing to come before the Lord in prayer.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:53.740]   I don't know how many times I've been frustrated with church,
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   and I would get on my knees praying and I would be rebuked.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   "Peter, be patient with them. Love them as I love them."
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.740]   There are times that I would get on my knees in prayer
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   wanting to just let it just pass and be convicted.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.740]   "Peter, if you love them, rebuke them.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.740]   If you love them, represent me properly.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.740]   Say everything that I would say if I was in that position."
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:27.740]   And oftentimes, it is my own heart,
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.740]   it is my own compromise that causes me to pick and choose
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   what I want to present and how I present it.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.740]   If I am not carefully listening to the Word of God
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.740]   and sensitive to my own obedience,
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:51.740]   I can easily create a God in the image that I desire Him to be.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:57.740]   And you are in that same boat.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:02.740]   If you pick and choose what you will obey and what you won't obey,
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   depending upon how difficult it is,
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:11.740]   sooner or later you will have created a God that looks nothing like Scripture.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   You will have the Scripture, you will be in the church,
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.740]   but it is not the God of the Bible.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:22.740]   Romans 10.17, it says, "So faith comes from hearing by the Word of Christ."
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.740]   John 10.27, "My sheep hear my voice.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.740]   I know them and they follow me."
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:36.740]   So it is imperative that I make sure that it is His voice that you hear.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:41.740]   Not my opinion, not my leaning, but His voice accurately.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.740]   Even the things that I don't want to say.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:47.740]   There are some things that I don't want to say
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:53.740]   because I know very specific people who are going to be hurt if I say it.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.740]   God did not give me that option.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.740]   As long as I'm representing Christ,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.740]   first and foremost, I have to make sure that it is His voice that you hear,
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:08.740]   encouraging or discouraging, it is His voice that you need to hear.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.740]   If we pick and choose, even as a pastor I wrestle with this,
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   if we pick and choose what we think is good and what we think is bad,
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.740]   eventually you will create a God of your own choosing.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.740]   2 Timothy 4.3-4, "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine."
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740]   In other words, they're not going to want to hear it.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   "But wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.740]   in accordance to their own desires."
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   In other words, they're going to create a God that's going to look and tolerate them in their sins.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.740]   "And will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths."
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.740]   They're not going to want to hear it.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.740]   It's going to make them feel uncomfortable.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   That's why I can talk generally about lordship,
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.740]   and I don't think anybody would disagree.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:58.740]   Yes, of course the Bible teaches that. Of course He's Lord.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:02.740]   But as soon as I talk about money,
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:11.740]   He wants more money because He doesn't want to do three services.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   Because I touch the nerve.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:18.740]   There's a reason why God chose money to establish lordship.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   Because He knows where your heart lies.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.740]   He knows where your treasure is.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.740]   I have no idea if you're giving and not giving because I'm not in the finance team.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:36.740]   But I know even in my own personal life that that's where the rubber meets the road.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   If I refuse to establish Christ as Lord over my finances,
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   from the beginning, then I will struggle in the middle.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.740]   And I will for sure struggle at the end.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:56.740]   I say, "Ah, okay, man. It was good as long as He kept it general, but now He's getting personal."
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   And that's what He says. He said, "You call me Lord, Lord, and you don't do what I say."
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.740]   The third part of it is the doing.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.740]   Some of you need to really pay attention.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.740]   Don't assume you've known things.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.740]   That's why once you become a teacher, you become a lousy student.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   The temptation is once you put on that leadership hat, it's hard to learn.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.740]   That's why I said not many of you should become teachers
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.740]   because once you see yourself as a teacher, you no longer learn.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.740]   It hinders your growth.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:33.740]   Some of you need to pay much more close attention to the Word of God and to yourself.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.740]   Yourself.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   Before the church, before anybody else, where are you?
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.740]   Where do you stand with Christ? I know who they say I am.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.740]   Who do you say that I am?
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:50.740]   And then there's many of you who are coming, trying to listen,
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   but that's where it ends.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:06:01.740]   And so every week, you're becoming a better, better analysist, analyst of the sermon.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.740]   So if somebody asks you, "How was the sermon today?"
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.740]   "It was good."
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.740]   "Ah, it wasn't good."
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   "Ah, it was okay."
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.740]   "Ah, a little bit too long this week."
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.740]   "I didn't like that illustration."
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.740]   So you become expert analyst of the Bible.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.740]   Good or bad, that's where it ends.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.740]   As soon as you hear it, it's like, "Oh."
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   You become very sensitive to how the sermon made you feel.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.740]   "I felt good. I felt encouraged."
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.740]   "I felt enlightened."
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.740]   "I felt taught."
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:45.740]   But the purpose of the Word of God is to cut and to move you.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   To build you.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.740]   So the question that we should be asking is,
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:56.740]   at the end of this sermon, what will you do?
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:02.740]   If you are guilty of saying, "Lord, Lord," and not doing what He says,
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.740]   the purpose of this sermon is not to say, "Oh, that was good. Yeah, that was good."
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   Thumbs up.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   And then you go back to your life, and then you come back next week,
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:13.740]   evaluate the next sermon.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:20.740]   "Oh, okay, that was good. Nah, today I don't know. He looked tired today."
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:27.740]   But that's where most of the sermons end, if we're not careful.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.740]   We need to come to Him.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   We need to listen to Him.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   And He calls us to do what He called us to do.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.740]   James 2:26, "For just as the body without the Spirit is dead,
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   so also faith without works is dead."
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   Is useless.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   If all faith is causing you to become a better analysist,
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:55.740]   analyst of the church, of the leadership, of what we're doing, what we're not doing,
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.740]   then all of it is for nothing.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.740]   But the word that you've heard, what does that look like in your life?
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   Not in that person's life and not in the church's life,
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.740]   but what does that look like in your life?
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.740]   John 8, 31-32, "So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him,
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:19.740]   'If you continue in my words, those who profess to believe Him,
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   if you continue, meno, if you continue, remain.'"
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.740]   And the other way that this word is translated is "obey."
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.740]   "Those who profess to believe Him, if you continue, if you obey my words,
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.740]   then you are truly disciples of mine."
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:41.740]   True disciples are not simply those who profess.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.740]   True disciples are those who obey.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:49.740]   And He said, "You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:55.740]   How many of you don't feel free today?
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.740]   How many of you don't feel free today?
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   That if you were to look at your life before you met Christ and after you met Christ,
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   you don't know--you can't tell what the huge difference is
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   other than the fact that you come to church,
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.740]   other than the fact that when you die, you don't have to worry,
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.740]   "Oh, I'm going to go to heaven."
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:18.740]   And so you have convinced yourself that Christ is Lord.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:24.740]   There's not much evidence in your life professing Lord, Lord,
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.740]   and yet you do not do what I say.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:32.740]   He says, "Those who obey my words, those are my disciples,
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:38.740]   and they will know the truth, and truth will set you free."
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:45.740]   There's a huge difference between somebody who is worshipping God because they've been set free.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:51.740]   There's a huge difference in the singing of people who've been set free,
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   who've been under bondage to their sin, but we've been set free.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:01.740]   There's a huge difference between people who are thankful to God because they've been set free.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.740]   Not because it's Thanksgiving, not because somebody asked you,
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.740]   and you're kind of like, "What am I thankful for?"
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   If the Son sets you free, you'll be free indeed.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   The church can't set you free, the counselors won't set you free,
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.740]   your friends aren't going to set you free.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.740]   He says, "Only Christ can set you free."
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.740]   And that's why the final word when he says,
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.740]   "A person who is saying, 'Lord, Lord,' but does not do what I say,"
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:34.740]   versus somebody who's saying, "Lord, Lord," coming, hearing, and doing what he tells them to do,
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:39.740]   he's like a man who builds his house on solid foundation.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:45.740]   So when the winds come, when the trials come, they will stand firm.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.740]   But those who profess, "Lord, Lord," and do not do what it says,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:55.740]   is like a man who's building on sand, and looks good for a while.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   As long as there's no storm, as long as the waters don't come,
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.740]   as long as the storms don't come, and your life is lived in peace,
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.740]   you can build your house, you can build it high,
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:15.740]   but as soon as you get tested, it will reveal what kind of foundation that you've built on.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   See, lordship isn't simply God telling us what you should and should not do.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.740]   It's like any parent telling their children, "Don't do that, don't do this,"
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:30.740]   because danger is coming. If you continue to go down this path,
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   if you refuse to be disciplined, if you spend all that time investing in things that you don't need,
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:40.740]   there's danger coming.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.740]   And it will be revealed in time, it will be revealed where your life is going to lead,
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:49.740]   just like we raise our children, warning them, instructing them, discipling them,
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.740]   and asking them to obey for their own good.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:12:02.740]   Christ establishes lordship in our life because He wants us to build our eternity on solid foundation.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:08.740]   Until Christ is Lord, everything that we do is building upon sand.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.740]   And it's just a matter of time.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:18.740]   Any structure that is built, and anything other than Christ, danger's coming.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   Danger between husband and wife, I guarantee you, it's coming.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:31.740]   Danger between your children, you may not see it now because they're young, but it's coming.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:38.740]   Danger between your parents, because it's founded upon things that are going to crumble.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   Every relationship, every endeavor, when the storm comes and is not built on the foundation of Christ, will crumble.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:52.740]   But the scripture says of Christ, the stone that the builders rejected,
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.740]   because they didn't see the beauty of Christ.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.740]   Because He came and He said, "Well, that's the Messiah."
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   There's a reason why Isaiah describes Him as a man who was not pleasant looking.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.740]   There's nothing about Him that man would be attracted to Him.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.740]   They rejected Him because He wasn't beautiful.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.740]   Because He wasn't going to give them what they wanted.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:24.740]   But He says the stone that the builders rejected had become the chief cornerstone.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:32.740]   The chief cornerstone, the foundation in which all of eternity will be built.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:41.740]   So if our houses are not built on the cornerstone of Christ, it's just a matter of time that it will crumble.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:49.740]   And the bigger you build that house, the bigger the heartache when it crumbles.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.740]   Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and not do what I say?
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.740]   He who comes to me and hears my word and does what He says,
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:04.740]   He's like a man who builds his house upon the foundation that is not Christ.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:11.740]   And when the storm comes, trials come, when you're tested, you will crumble and your heartache will be great.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:17.740]   But those who hear my words and they do what I tell them to do,
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:23.740]   and establish Him as Lord, will build their house upon the foundation of Christ.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.740]   And when the storms come and you get tested and the building gets tested,
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:33.740]   you will see that you did not waste your time.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.740]   That the Lordship of Christ is building for eternity.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.740]   My prayer is, again, that you don't leave the Sunday sermon,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.740]   it's like, "How was the sermon today?"
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.740]   It's like, "It was a little bit long today."
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.740]   It's like, "Oh, you know, I like the way he broke down the sermon, three-point sermon, that's good.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.740]   It was easy to remember."
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.740]   "Oh, I like that story, you know, his illustration, that was good."
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:08.740]   Like, or dislike, the end.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:14.740]   If all it is, is us professing with our mouth,
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:18.740]   and you're not going to practice this in your life,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.740]   how is this any different than what he's addressing?
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   How is that any different than the warning that he's giving?
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:33.740]   I pray that we would be more than people who just give lip service.
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:38.740]   Establish Christ as Lord, and build,
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:42.740]   so that at the end of your life you may not look back at the 60, 70, 80 years that you lived,
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.740]   and say, "Oh, I wish I could have had that time again."
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:52.740]   I pray that we would be wise enough to practice it while we have time.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:16:02.740]   Let's pray.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.740]   Father, help us.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Help us in our weakness.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:13.740]   Help us, Lord God, with our constant entanglement.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:21.740]   Help us, Lord, with not being able to see the big picture, Lord God, of Christ coming.
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:27.740]   Help us, Lord God, to see how vain this world is.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:35.740]   The things that we desire, our reputation, the place that we live, the cars that we drive.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.740]   Help us to see it from an eternal perspective,
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:47.740]   that we may live, Lord, in obedience, recognizing that it is no longer our lives to live,
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.740]   but that we would truly be crucified with Christ,
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.740]   that our lives would be hidden with Christ,
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.740]   that we would eagerly wait for the coming of Christ.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.740]   Lord, convict us.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:09.740]   Reveal to us specifically where we have been avoiding you,
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.740]   that we may be more than just hearers, but to be doers of your Word.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.740]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:24.740]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:31.740]   [music]

[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.740]   There is none beside you.

[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:33.740]   And I will build my life upon your love.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:39.740]   It is a firm foundation.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   I will put my trust in you alone.

[01:20:52.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   And I will build my life upon your love.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   It is a firm foundation.

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.740]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.740]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.740]   blameless with great joy, to the only God our Savior,

[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.740]   and authority before all time and now and forever.
