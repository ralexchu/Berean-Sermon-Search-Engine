[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Reading out of the ESV,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Through Him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank You so much for this morning.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We pray, Father, that Your Word would have its effect on us,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   that we would be more than just listeners, but we would be eager to apply all that You give.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Give us enlightenment, Lord God, as You open our eyes and soften our hearts.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   As we've been going through the book of Romans, and again, just reemphasizing as what Paul emphasized,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   setting the foundation for our faith.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   The question that I have for you this morning is,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   "What do you remember when you first met Christ?"
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Take a minute to think about that.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I know some of you guys don't know exactly when you met Christ.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   A lot of your testimonies are, you heard the Gospel when you were young,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   you're not exactly sure when you made a commitment, sometime in your high school, sometime in college,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   maybe in your 20s or your 30s, but you can't exactly pinpoint when it happened.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But whether you can pinpoint when it happened, or whether it was a period of time,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   what do you first remember when you became a Christian?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Just think for a minute.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   What do you value about your salvation?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   When was the last time that that has affected you?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So when you think of salvation today,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   what is the most tangible thing that you think of as a benefit of salvation,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   other than security when you die?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Again, I ask you to take some time to think about all of this stuff,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   because what salvation has accomplished in us,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   if this does not have tangible applications in our daily life,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   all it is, is a security blanket.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   All it becomes is a security blanket that if I die, I have security that I'm not going to go to hell.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But it doesn't affect the way we live.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It doesn't affect the way we think.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It doesn't affect our relationship.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Our life doesn't look any different than anybody else.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's why Apostle Paul, when he's writing the Book of Romans,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   the goal of the Book of Romans is not so that after you read it and after you study it,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   if somebody asks you what the Gospel is, you say, "Oh, I've taken a class in the Book of Romans,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   so now I can tell you what the Gospel is."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The purpose of why Paul wrote this Gospel, or the Book of Romans,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   is to set a proper foundation upon which Christianity,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   our whole walk with God, is based upon.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Again, it's not simply for your information.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's for transformation.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   The first few verses that we looked at in the last couple of weeks,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   we find that the benefit of justification by faith, by our salvation,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   first of all, he says, "We have peace with God."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We have peace with God.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Now, we don't normally think too much about the fact that the wrath of God is no longer on us,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   because I don't know how many of us really felt the effect of the wrath of God.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So when the Bible says that His wrath was taken away from us,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   it's kind of like, "Okay, now we have this access."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Secondly, he says, "We have peace with God, but we have access to this God."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Access. Again, how often do we think about the gift that we've been given to be able to access our God?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   How excited do you get when you meet a movie star?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And I know a few of you who have met Kobe Bryant because he lives in this area,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   whether it was at Jamba Juice or Irvine Spectrum, because it's on your Facebook.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I've seen it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Because you get excited if you somehow have some kind of encounter with him,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   or some movie star at some restaurant, snap, snap.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's on Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, whatever else is out there.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Because you're excited.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And if he somehow, or that person somehow, makes eye contact with you,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   then it's a huge deal.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's on Facebook. Look at me.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And then you take a picture with them.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And all it was was just a chance passing by,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and you were able to take a picture with somebody that this world considers significant.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And it's a big deal.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But consider what the Bible says, that because of what Christ has done,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   we have access to this God.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Not simply that we have to pray, but that you are able to pray.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That you're able to speak to the living God who created us.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   The very reason why you and I are able to exist today.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That we have access to this God that mankind did not have because of what Christ has done on the cross.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But because we have this access to God, that we have joy for the hope that we have in the glory of the coming Christ.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So that was what he laid out last week.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Now that in and of itself should get us excited.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That in and of itself should awe us and cause us to be worshiping God.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   But if you look at verse 3, he says,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "Above that, more than that, we rejoice in our suffering, knowing that suffering produces endurance."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Now what I just told you was spectacular, but he says,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   he begins the next phase of what he's about to say, is that all of that is great, it is fantastic,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   but what I'm about to tell you is even beyond that.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It's more than that.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So what is he possibly going to say?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   What is he possibly going to say that he's trying to bring attention, like,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "I know these things are fantastic, but here's something more than what I just told you."
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And he begins by saying that the suffering, even in suffering, you rejoice.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   See, previously he said, "We rejoice because of the hope that is coming in the glory of God."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But even more than what I just told you,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "We rejoice not only for the hope of the glory, but even in suffering."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Let me take a step back and let's be real.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I know we're doing Bible study and a lot of times I say things up here because it's in the Bible,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   but let's be real.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   When was the last time you suffered and you rejoiced?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   When was the last time, I mean, you could say that, "Oh, I rejoiced because of what the Bible said."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's what a good Christian has to say.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But when there's suffering in your life, how many of you really rejoice?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Is this one of those theological things that you just say because you're a Christian?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You're supposed to, but really it's not the reality.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   What does he mean here?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I think when we start to dissect and really take a close look at what Paul is saying here,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I think it's going to make a lot more sense.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And sometimes we read this passage in particular,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and we think that what it's saying is that God brings suffering in our lives,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and then if you endure through these sufferings, that God's going to make you a man of character.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And if you have this character, that it is a source of hope.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And if you have this hope, you have joy.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So the point of suffering is to make you a better Christian.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And if you're a better Christian, there's better hope for you.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And that's what's causing joy.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Now, don't raise your hand.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But how many of you read that passage that way?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I told you not to raise your hand, so don't raise your hand.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Just think about how many of you have thought of this passage thinking like that's the application.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I want to take a closer look at it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And again, when we interpret a passage, what's the most important part of interpreting a passage?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I've got to learn how to interpret whispers, because that's usually the kind of answers I get.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Context. Right?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's what you said. That's what everybody said, but that's what I heard.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Context. Right?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   The most important part of understanding the text is context.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   What was he saying before? What was he saying after?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And how does this passage fit into that?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You're not supposed to take a passage and just pluck it out.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Just like if you're reading a love letter, you don't read one sentence in the middle and say, "Oh, I get it. I get his heart."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You have to read the whole thing. You have to read it in the context.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So I want to take a look at the context of what he is saying and see if that's what he's saying.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That that's the source of rejoicing is when God brings suffering in your life, is to make you a better Christian.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So if you're a better Christian, you have greater hope and greater joy. Right?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   First of all, what does he mean by suffering?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   The word suffering, literally in the Greek concordance, is to crush, to press, to compress, or to squeeze.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So the idea behind this word suffering is to be squeezed. Right?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's to be squeezed.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Now, the early church, suffering was equated with Christianity.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Today, suffering, it depends on where you live.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I mean, today, Christianity in Orange County, when you think of Christian, you don't think of suffering. Right?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   But the first 300 years of Christianity, immediately, Christianity was equated with suffering.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Because Jesus himself said, "If you want to follow me, you have to pick up your cross."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Suffering. His first disciples who followed Jesus, they all, majority of them, with the exception of one,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   they all ended up being martyred.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Not only the disciples, but almost every person that we see in the scripture.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Barnabas, Mark, Luke, all of these guys that we know in scripture, it's not mentioned in the Bible,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   but in church history, we know that they were also martyred with the apostles. Right?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So we're not just simply talking about hard life, we're talking about all the people that we know written in scripture.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Majority of them were also martyred.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Apostle Paul, the one writing this letter, he's writing this letter in between being beaten,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   going to prison in and out, suffering, being denied, people questioning his apostleship.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So in the midst of much suffering, he writes this letter.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So it's understandable that Apostle Paul is telling them, is telling a group of people who is under this intense pressure,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   that even in suffering, we rejoice because it produces endurance. Endurance produces character, and character gives us hope.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But, again, let me re-understand what this passage means, okay?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And hopefully you'll be able to follow along, so at the end of the service, like, "What did he say?"
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I need you to follow along with the logic and the context, so that we can, hopefully I can convince you that
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I don't think that that's what this passage means.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Or else you're going to hate me at the end. You're going to say, "What is this guy talking about?" Right?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The word "suffering" here is talking about being pressed and compressed and to be squeezed.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   But the word is not limited to persecution.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   It's not just talking about people who are living in difficult areas, who are being persecuted.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Anything that causes you to be squeezed, to feel pressure.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Now, most of you, including myself, are not experiencing persecution.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Maybe some of you, right?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Maybe at work, people, your friends are laughing at you, or, you know, or maybe co-workers.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Maybe your boss, because you're a Christian, won't give you a raise, whatever that may be.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   But the majority of us, on a day-to-day basis, do not experience persecution as suffering.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   But the word here, "suffering," is talking about anything that squeezes you.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Now, I'll bet you, based upon that definition, that there's a whole lot of you, even today, who's being squeezed.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Some of you are squeezed because you have some people in your life that you just cannot stand.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   For whatever the reason, they're annoying you. Right?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Some of you are being squeezed because you're at work, and you're overworked, and you're tired.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And there's a threat of maybe being let go.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Some of you are being pressured because of just business and life.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Some of you just had kids. Second, third, fourth, fifth, six kids.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And you're just trying to survive.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So, this word for "suffering" here, "to be squeezed," is anything that causes you to be tempted away from God.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Anything that's happening in your life that causes you to be tempted away from God.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   That could be inside the church, or outside the church.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   That could be at work. It could be social. It could be emotional. It could be financial. It could be physical.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Whatever it is that God allows in your life to put a squeeze in your life.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Now, he says, "We rejoice in the suffering because the suffering produces endurance."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Now, here's another word that we need to understand.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   The word "endurance," in other translations, is translated "perseverance," or in another translation, "patience."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   The word literally, "hupomeno," basically means "to remain under."
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   So, what he's saying is, "Suffering, being squeezed, causes you to remain under."
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Okay, you get the picture?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So, basically what he's saying, what God is saying is, "We rejoice because God puts a compressor in your life to squeeze you,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   and when you're being squeezed, it forces you to stay and remain under this pressure."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That's why we rejoice.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   No, that's not why we rejoice.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   How many of you rejoice because you're under pressure, and then God's making you stay there?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Right?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He said, "If our understanding of suffering is God squeezing you, and he don't want you to move, like, that's a good thing for you."
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   That's not what he's saying, because if that's where our understanding of suffering stops, of course it's going to cause bitterness.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Because life is hard.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   You know, life is hard as it is.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   If somebody is wronging you, I mean, it's very satisfying to slap them back.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It's very frustrating to not to slap them back.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And then to turn the other cheek.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Have you ever seen anybody turn the other cheek?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   You know how excruciatingly painful it is to not to retaliate?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   If our understanding of suffering is God's going to squeeze you, and you remain under, you stay put.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And sometimes a lot of Christians, that's the way they understand suffering.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   It's like, "Oh, you know, God's doing it to me. I've got to just stay put."
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Right?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   "I can't retaliate. I can't do anything. I've just got to stay put."
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And then after, what is the fruit of that?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Bitterness.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Anger.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Right?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Bad memories.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And people just, you know, there's a lot of bitterness.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   The longer you've been a Christian, the longer you've been at church, the more bitter you are in your heart.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Because you've been just sucking it up and taking it.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Right?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   But that's not what he's talking about.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   What he's saying is, suffering, squeezing, causes you to remain under this pressure.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Because when you remain under this pressure, what does it produce?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Character.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Right?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Now, here's the turning point of understanding this text.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Character, in English, we mean all kinds of stuff.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   When I say, "Oh, that guy's a character," I could mean, "That guy's a joker."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Right?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "That guy's always wearing a bow tie."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   "He's cracking jokes. He's a character."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Or, if I say, "He's a character," it's like, "He's kind of quirky. He's a little bit different. He's a bit off. He's a character."
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Or we say, "He has character," meaning he has integrity. He's trustworthy.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Right?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   So, the word "character" means all kinds of stuff in English.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So, we need to properly understand, what does Paul mean when he says, "It produces character."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Okay?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Now, if this passage means that when suffering comes, God puts you under pressure,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and when you endure through that pressure, God causes character,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and so once you begin to develop character in your life, you have hope.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Because that hope doesn't disappoint, and that's the source of rejoicing.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Is he saying that when you become a better Christian, there's greater hope for you?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Is that what he is saying in this text?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Now, remember, in order to properly understand it, what do we need to understand?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Context! Yes, thank you!
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Right?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Context. Right?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   In the context, what has Paul been trying to establish?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Justification by faith alone.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   For three plus chapters, his main point was,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   if you have the law, you will be condemned by the law.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   If you don't have the law, you will be condemned without the law.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   If your idea of salvation is that if you try harder, if you work harder,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and you have better character, better morality, better obedience,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   that you will have this hope because you have better access to God,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   he says, "There is no hope for you."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Isn't that the point that he's been trying to make all this time?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Yes or no?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Yes!
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   That's the point that he's been trying.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   We've spent like five months talking about that, right?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That's the point. Justification by faith.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   So, is he all of a sudden changing direction and saying,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   you know, we've been talking about justification by faith up to verse 2 of chapter 5,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   and then all of a sudden he says, you know, more than that,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   more than justification by faith, right?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   More than justification by faith.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   When God puts pressure in your life and you remain under it,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and then it causes you to have character, then we have hope.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Then it causes rejoicing.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Is that the meaning?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I hope you follow what I'm saying, right?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Because typically that's how we understand this passage.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Typically that's how we interpret it, and that's how we apply this passage.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But is that what he is saying?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   What's interesting is this word, again, for character,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   literal translation, in the Greek concordance,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   it means to be approved, to be tried, to prove to be genuine.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   To be proved to be genuine.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That same word is used this way in 2 Corinthians 13.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Paul is talking to the Corinthians church, who is questioning his apostleship,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and he says, "For in a severe test of..."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Oh, sorry. "Since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Proof. Right?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That same word that is translated "character" here, in 2 Corinthians 13.3,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   is translated "proof." Right?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   That you want proof that I'm an apostle, and here it is.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   2 Corinthians 8.2, that same word again is translated "a test."
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   The test that has brought affliction upon their life
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   has proven for them, the Macedonians,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   that they were giving extremely, even in their midst of extreme poverty,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   that they were willing to give.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Now how did this happen? Because their faith was being tested.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Hopefully you followed up to that point. Ok?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   If not, you are going to have to re-hear the sermon. Ok?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Because this is really important.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   He has led you up to this point, and then I don't think he is changing direction,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   and all of a sudden he says, "You know, you have hope and justification by faith,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   not by your works."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I hear something more than that, that if God puts you under pressure,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and it causes character, then you really have hope.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   That, I do not think that is what he is saying.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   What he is saying is, that when God brings this pressure,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   whatever that pressure may be in your life,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   and you see this, and you persevere underneath it,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   you remain underneath, because you know that this is God doing it.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And when you remain underneath, it proves what?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   What does it prove?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   It proves the genuineness of your faith.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It proves the genuineness of this faith.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So what he is saying is not, your character, because you become a better Christian,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   that somehow that is giving you better hope.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   The better hope that he is talking about is the assurance that your faith is genuine.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   The whole time that he has been talking about how our whole walk with God,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   our whole salvation, to be saved from condemnation from hell,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   all hinges upon this faith.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   See, I think the problem that you and I have in our culture is that
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   we talk about salvation by faith, and you say, "Oh, really? That is all it requires?"
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You just have to believe?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And so we just kind of like, "Okay, I believe."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Some of you came down aisles, some of you filled out papers,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   some of you guys just confessed it.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And it was just, "Oh, really? That is it?"
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And whether you really, truly believed it or not,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   it was just, "Okay, I will take it. Why not? What do I have to lose?"
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   See, but what Paul is saying is, if peace with God, access to this God,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and joy of His Second Coming all hinges upon this faith,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   then shouldn't this faith be genuine?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   If everything hinges upon this faith,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   then wouldn't we carefully examine to see if this faith is genuine?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Right now, we are working on our new building.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And in the new building, because the occupancy is changing.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Before it was a warehouse, and there was the plumbing thing going on,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   but now they know that a church is coming.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So they have new regulations.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Some of you guys who have been to the new church site,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   you know how we have these small poles because the building is smaller.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   The building is much larger over there, so the poles are much bigger.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So the city is requiring that we have to fortify whatever is holding up the building.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Because they want to make sure.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   So the whole building, the safety of all the people that are going to go into this building,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   hinges upon the amount of weight that this building can hold.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So there are certain parts of the building that we need to re-fortify.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So we need to get a structural engineer to do recalculation.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   So if we put an air conditioner on top of here,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   they have to make sure that whatever is holding that up is able to hold that up.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And so the more the consequence, the more carefully we need to examine
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   to make sure that there's enough structure to be able to hold that up.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So if our Christian faith, our salvation from condemnation,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   our ability to call Him our Abba Father,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   to have peace with Him, to have access to this God,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that we are co-heirs with Christ,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   to all that the scripture promises,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   if it hinges upon this faith,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   then doesn't this faith have to be examined to see if it's true?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Not just wishful thinking.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Not just church attendance.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Not just raising of your hand.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   But if everything that God had promised, the Son of God,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   was given to us, and our access to this was by this faith,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   then shouldn't this be tested to see if it's genuine?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   See, that's what he's talking about.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   That God allows the pressure to come into a life of a Christian,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and when He remains underneath that,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   you have confidence that your faith is genuine.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And when you recognize that your faith is genuine,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   then you have hope. And this hope does not disappoint.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   So it's not talking about your character necessarily.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Now, does that mean that what we do with our life doesn't matter?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Of course not.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Paul's going to spend 12 chapters talking about this justification by faith,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   and then when he gets to chapter 12,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   he's going to pound the imperatives.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   But the imperatives of our obedience is based upon
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   assurance of faith.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   So if there is shakiness of faith,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   if you're not assured of this faith,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   then your obedience is going to be nothing more than
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   checking off the right and what I need to do.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Just religiousness.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   See, that's what he means in James chapter 1 and 2.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   It says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   for you know that the testing of your" what?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   "Faith." Right?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   He says God allows various trials in our life
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   so that your faith may be tested and produce steadfastness,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   and let steadfastness, perseverance, have its full effect.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   In other words, what God intended.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   That you may be perfect, complete, lacking nothing.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Right?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Will we ever be completely sanctified while we live here?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   If you say yes, we need to talk to you after service
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   because you don't understand your salvation.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Paul says in Philippians 1.6, right?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   He says, "He who began a good work in you will carry it until the day of completion,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   until Christ."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   So, our sanctification, our struggle against sin,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   is going to continue until He comes.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   But he says, he brings trials into our lives
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   to test our faith and allow your perseverance,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   remaining under this pressure,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   so that it would have its full effect,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   that you may be perfect, "Helios," complete, whole,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and not lacking anything.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   When he says to be complete and not lacking anything,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   is he talking about you?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Is he talking about me?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   He's talking about our faith.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Because what was tested?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Your faith.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Now, why does he say that?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Because he's going to pound in the book of James
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that faith without deeds is not true faith.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Right? That's the whole theme of the book of James.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Faith without deeds is not real faith.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   So, he begins, before he gets into that argument,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   what is true faith?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Faith, God will allow various trials in your life,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   that when you remain under this pressure,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   then you are assured that you have this faith,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   so that you may be complete, whole, not lacking anything,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   because when you have this genuine faith,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   it will produce works.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It will produce works.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   As Abraham was tested.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   As Hebrews chapter 11, he says,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   because of this genuine faith,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   that these people went out and did all these things.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   They were willing to risk their lives,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   risk possession, risk everything,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   because of this faith.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Hebrews, 11 chapters,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   are preparing why Jesus Christ fulfills all righteousness.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   And so, if you believe that,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   if that faith is genuine,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   then you will produce works.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   That was his whole point.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   See, the way God tests the genuineness of our faith
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   is that He squeezes us.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Sometimes that squeezing is really hard.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   It may be trials.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   It may be an illness.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It may be financial.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   It may even be relationship at home.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Husband and wife.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Maybe even with your children.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Whatever that may be,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   there are trials that come into our life,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   where God will squeeze us,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and sometimes He will squeeze us hard.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And whatever comes out of that,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   is what we see what was in us.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   You know what's interesting is,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I see trials coming into people's lives,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   and the response is so varied.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I've seen guys that I thought,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   "Wow, that guy just lost his father,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and he wasn't a Christian.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   He'd been begging. He's such a young Christian."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And then the response is just,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   "Wow, he was strengthened in his faith.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He loved Jesus even more."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Beyond my logic.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I was praying for him,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   because I thought that if God didn't answer this prayer,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   that he would walk away from his faith,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   because he was such a young Christian.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   But instead, his faith is even more strengthened,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   for whatever the reason. Beyond my logic.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And he's walking faithfully to God.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   And for whatever the reason, when he got squeezed,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   his love for the Lord was confirmed even more.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And then I see people who are confessing Christians,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   maybe even leaders in the church,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and they walk away from the faith,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   simply because they didn't get along with somebody.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "Oh, you know, I don't like these people.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   They're hypocrites."
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And that's enough. That's enough for them to fold.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Or they come to church, and, "Oh, nobody reached out to me."
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   That's enough.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   That's all it took for them to say, "Forget this."
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   See, God says he brings trials into our lives
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   to put pressure on us.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And when we remain under this pressure,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   it produces proof.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Your perseverance in your walk with God
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   is proof.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   What is it proof?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Look with me in verse 4.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   And hope does not put us to shame.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Meaning that if your faith is genuine,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   that this hope is on solid ground.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   It is absolutely dependable.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Because God's love has been poured into our hearts
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   What does it prove?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   When you're under pressure,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and you remain under this pressure,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and it proves the genuineness of your faith,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and therefore you have this hope,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and what does this hope do?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   It proves, what?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   God's love.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It proves God's love.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Now let me explain to you what I mean by that.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Those of you who have been Christians for a while,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   when I say a while, I'm not talking about 2-3 months.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I'm talking about several years, or longer.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   How many times were you tempted
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   to throw your hands up and quit?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   How many times were you tempted
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   to say, "I don't want to deal with people anymore."
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Like, "I don't want this anymore."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   How many times were you tempted to think
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   that if I never met Christ,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   if God never preached the Gospel to me,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   my life would be easier.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   That because I met Christ,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   there's turmoil in my home.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   I have a hard time connecting with my kids.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   I've been having trouble at work.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And the people at church
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   are just disappointment after disappointment.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Now you don't have to raise your hand,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   because I can tell you by my own confession
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   how many times I struggle with that.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   But what caused you to persevere?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   What caused you to remain?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Were you more, did you have more willpower
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   than an average person?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Were you more determined?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Were you more strong-willed?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Were you smarter?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Were you more educated?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Did you have more talent than the other person?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   What caused you to be here today?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Now I'm not saying that we were all successful,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   that we were all obedient,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   but in the context of this pressure,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   what caused you to continue to persevere?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Proving that the love of God is in you.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Wasn't it your faith?
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Now I can't answer that for you,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I'm just asking you.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But what caused you to persevere?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Wasn't it because you could not ignore the love of God?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   That God opened your eyes to the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and even if everything inside of me humanly says,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   "I don't want this,"
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   that you could not deny what God has shown you.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   You could not deny the love of God.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Even if you wanted to, you couldn't.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   He's opened your eyes, softened your heart.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   He's opened your ears, and you can never shut it.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Even when you are tempted to shut it, you cannot.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   He said that's evidence that the Holy Spirit has been poured in you
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   because He loves you.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And the reason why you and I are here today
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   is because the evidence of His love in the Holy Spirit is sustaining us.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   The only reason why I stand here this morning
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   is not because I am good.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It's not because I'm a better preacher, I'm more talented.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   It's because God's been merciful.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And I am tempted.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I am tempted when I'm under pressure.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I am tempted when I'm criticized.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I am tempted when I'm frustrated with people.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I am tempted.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   But the love of Christ compels me.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   As it compels you.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And so what Paul is saying, here's all that we have
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   because of this faith.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And God will bring pressure in your life,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   but when you remain, and your faith is proven to be genuine,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   then you know that the love of Christ compels you.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   That's why you're here this morning.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Not because you've done well.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Not because you read your scripture.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Not because you prayed more than other people.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Because the love of Christ compels you.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   He's drawing you.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I mean, isn't there, can't you think of better things to do
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   than listen to me every week?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And pay offering.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And pray with certain people that you don't get along with.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   You know, when we talk about these trials,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   this pressure that we feel,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   typically we think about persecution and all this stuff.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But I think that sometimes the biggest trials that you and I face,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   this pressure that we feel,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   that people oftentimes fall,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   is not under financial pressure, not even health.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And definitely not persecution.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Because persecution, we know for a fact that it strengthens the church.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   It's affluence. Affluence.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Those of you who've been to ministry with us out in China,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   years ago, when we first used to go,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   there was a sense of fear that if they became a Christian,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   that they would lose their status.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Especially those who were very high-functioning.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You know, they had good grades, and there was a possibility
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   that the Communist Party may invite them to be a part of the Communist Party.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So if they become a Christian, it's actually stated in their statement
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   that you can't be a Christian.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   So either they have to hide it, or they have to denounce it.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   So when somebody became a Christian,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   they thought through all the consequences.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   They counted the costs.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And when they became a Christian, they were being baptized.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It was very serious.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   But the problem that the underground church in China is facing today
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   is not the persecution.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   As much as you hear about persecution today,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   in China, the biggest problem in China today is affluence.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Is that now they're being squeezed.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   They've been squeezed with persecution, and they were thriving.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Now they're being squeezed with wealth.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Very similar to what we're wrestling with.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And I remember years ago, some of you guys may remember,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   because we were there together.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   We were running an English camp, and this guy came out,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and his name was Lee Tao.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   He was one of the local small group leaders.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And his English was excellent.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   So we were talking to him, and he was such an encouragement to us.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So I was excited to connect with him.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   We went out and had dinner.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And in the context of dinner, he mentioned somebody's name
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   that was very familiar to me.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   He mentioned Kenneth Copeland.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   So some of you guys know who Kenneth Copeland is.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   He's associated with the health and wealth gospel.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   So obviously I was disturbed, and I asked him,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   "Is this the Kenneth Copeland that I'm thinking about?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And does he teach the health and wealth?"
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And he says, he was kind of confused, "Yeah, that's what he teaches."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I said, "How prominent is his teaching?"
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   He said, "Everybody I know studies this."
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   So I said, "Okay, I need to take some time to study the scripture with him."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   So right in the middle of dinner, we got the Bible out,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   and we started going through the scripture.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   This is not what it says.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   This is not what Jesus said.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   This is not what Apostle Paul said.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   This is false gospel.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And at the end of the dinner, I asked him,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   "So, Lee, what do you think about this?"
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And he said, "I can't deny what's in the scripture,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   because you showed it to me.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   But this is not going to be very popular."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And he's just being honest.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   He said, "This is not going to be popular.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Not many Chinese Christians are going to accept what you said."
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   The problem that the Chinese church now has,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   is that now they're tempted with finance.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   When they were persecuted, the church was strengthened.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Now they're being tempted and squeezed with wealth.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And it is diluting the church.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   See, you and I, we don't know that you are being squeezed right now.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Not because of work, not because of relationship,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   but you and I are being squeezed right now because of wealth.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Because of affluence.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Because of freedom, because of money, because of distraction.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Not realizing that all of this is a form of squeezing.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And it's a form of testing.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   To see how much of our faith is real.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   How much of this faith in Orange County is real.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And it is in this squeezing that at the end of it,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   God is looking for genuine faith.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Genuine faith.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Because when Jesus came, that's all he was looking for.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   People who had genuine faith.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   So genuine faith, in the context of where you and I are,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   is not simply like, "Oh, you know, when I was in China, or when I was in India,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   or when I was poor, when I was sick."
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Everybody seeks God when they're desperate.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   The problem with the nation of Israel wasn't when the Assyrians and the Babylonians were coming,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   because when they were coming, they were clinging to God.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   The constant cycle of Israel's sin was
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   that when God answered their prayer because they were desperate,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   they thanked God, worshipped Him for a period,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   and when everything went back to normal, they forgot God,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   and then they began to play around with idolatry.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   See, the greatest struggle and the testing for us,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   is that in the midst of affluence,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   will you still serve the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Is our faith genuine?
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   So if God reveals the genuineness of our faith through the pressure
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and to remain under,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   what happens to a church that a knee-jerk reaction to any conflict
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   is to find the easiest path?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   What happens to a faith, or group of people, or generation,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   where our knee-jerk reaction is always find the easiest path?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Then your faith is never confirmed.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Because assurance, the proving of our faith, comes through pressure.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   But if we avoid pressure with every possible energy that I have,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   then what does it create?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   It creates a generation of people who are not assured of their faith.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And they're always worshipping God with the hint of doubt.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Because they continue to get out under pressure.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   "This person I don't like? I go over here."
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   "I don't fit in around here? I go over here."
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   And every decision we make is to make our life easier.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Now God didn't call us to make it difficult,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   but God did tell us the greatest gift that He has given us is faith.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   And what causes the greatest joy and greatest hope
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   is when we know that that faith is true.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   When our faith is genuine, we go back.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   We have access to God.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   We have hope, no matter what happens in this earth.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Think of the most tragic thing that could possibly happen in your life.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   At the end of all of that? Glory. Glory.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Whatever you could possibly imagine could be the worst possible thing happen in your life,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   at the end result of that, because of justification by faith, is glory.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It's not suffering. It's not hell. It's not condemnation. It's not judgment.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   That no matter what happens, it ends in glory.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   That's why He squeezes us.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   So that you and I may be assured that we have this access with God.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   That's why Paul, that's why Paul is squeezing us.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   That's why God is squeezing us.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Some of you guys are under a lot of pressure, but He's squeezing you for a purpose.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Some of you are under pressure because of your children.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Some of you are under pressure because of work.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Some of you are under pressure because of church.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   But when we remain, we have hope.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I want to lead us into the time of communion.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Remind us again, this faithful hymn that reminds us of what we have in Christ.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And if you can put up the slide so that we can see the lyrics.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I'm going to read it through, all the way through verse 4.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Then I'm going to have the praise team come up and we'll sing it together.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And after that I'm going to open up the communion table.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   So when we open up the communion table, again I want to invite you guys to think about
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   what it is that we exactly have in Christ.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   This doesn't earn your salvation.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   You don't come here because you deserve it.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   We come because He's given it to us.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   The fact that you and I are here, the fact that you even understand what I'm saying
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   is evidence of the love of God in your life.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   So to come and really celebrate, that no matter where you are in life, to really praise God.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   So I want to read the lyrics to you because it pretty much summarizes what we've been talking about.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   His oath, His covenant and blood support me in the whelming flood.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   When every earthly prop gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   When He shall come with trumpet sound, oh may I then in Him be found.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Clothed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Amen, amen, amen.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   What else makes you happy?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   I mean, really, what possible thing can we be entangled in
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   that makes you more happier than this?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Our eternity is secure in His hands.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   And you're here, and you persevere.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   God brought you here through all your trials, through all the temptations,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   through all the disappointments.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   God brought you here because He loves you.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   So let's celebrate this this morning as we have the communion table.
