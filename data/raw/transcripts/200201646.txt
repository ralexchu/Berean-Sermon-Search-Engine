[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   All right.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.680]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.000]   This is a good spot for me to stand.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   Okay.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.480]   So today, I had some warm-up questions and whatnot, but I hope you guys got an opportunity
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.920]   to look at the passage.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.960]   For tonight, we're going to move on ahead with the study and then starting from next
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   week at the beginning when you guys enter in.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.000]   As you guys come in and fill the table and stuff, we're going to just begin with having
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.340]   some time of discussion with each other as a way to think about the passage, take a look
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.840]   at the passage, and et cetera.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.480]   So just letting you guys know what to expect.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   So let's all turn our Bibles to 1 Peter 1, verses 6 through 12.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.080]   All right.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   And then I'll read the passage for us.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.920]   And it says this, "In this, you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.200]   you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.000]   precious than gold, which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.520]   in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.400]   And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.860]   And though you do not see him now, but believe in him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.000]   and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.040]   searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the spirit of Christ within
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.860]   them was indicating as he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.960]   It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.760]   And these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look."
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.480]   All right, let's take some time to pray.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.960]   And God, we want to just saturate our time with both prayerful hearts and expectant hearts.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   God, that you by your spirit would give light, that you by your spirit would give conviction.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.440]   Lord, help us to have hearts that are constantly yearning, yearning for the knowledge of truth,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.040]   yearning for the knowledge of our God.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.240]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   Amen.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   Amen.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   Okay.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.200]   So, jumping right into the passage tonight, we begin with verse six that says, "In this
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.960]   you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.800]   distressed by various trials."
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Okay?
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.560]   By way of introduction, I don't know if you, if someone were to ask you, "When was the
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.920]   last time you were so happy you cried?"
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   You know?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.080]   When was the last time where you were just like so happy, like tears are coming out?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.880]   Maybe if you were just like laughing so hard or whatever it may be, where the emotion was
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.760]   so strong that it almost looked the opposite.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.160]   Like it was so good, it hurt.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   And you know, for me, the last time I can remember is the time just seeing Josiah being
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   born.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480]   You know, I don't know if you consider me like an emotional guy or whatever, I can't
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   remember.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   You know?
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.080]   But like, I remember distinctly seeing him come out and just like this welling up, you
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   know?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   And the reason why I asked that is because this passage has a lot to do with incredible
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.720]   joy.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.960]   Incredible joy.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.760]   Now what's interesting is in verse six, it says, "Hey, in this you greatly rejoice,"
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   and then it goes on.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.080]   But rather than just passing it over, let's ask the question.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.120]   Question number one, what does "in this" refer to?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.120]   What are we talking about?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   Okay, oops.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   What are we talking about when we ask, "In this we rejoice"?
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   Is he talking about these various trials?
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.520]   Is he talking about the things that are necessary?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.120]   Is he talking about the fact that things, you know, in terms of the suffering, it's
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   temporary?
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.520]   What is it that we are rejoicing over?
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   And I want to do a quick review with you from the last time, okay?
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   Remember last time, an apostle Peter went at length to describe the work of God in salvation.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   So he had a bunch of things that he talked about.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.520]   Apostle Peter talked about how you are chosen, that God had made you born again, and that
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.200]   he protects you, right?
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.080]   He made an incredible kind of, you know, packed sermon almost of these three things
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.700]   that he has accomplished for you, and then he described how he did that according to
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.600]   his knowledge, his sovereign knowledge, according to his mercy and his power.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   So in terms of our being chosen, in terms of being born again, and in terms of being
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   protected, it is accordance with his great might and strength.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   What's more?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.280]   The way, the means by which he accomplished this is by the work of the spirit, by the
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.840]   resurrection and again the power of God.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:49.680]   Then lastly, and all of that continues to have a trajectory for obedience, for his purity,
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.760]   or for purity, for hope and an inheritance that remember was imperishable, upgrade proof,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   and unstained.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   Unstained by anything.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.120]   And wrapping our minds around this, in terms of the thing that causes us to rejoice, we
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.080]   have to think about all of that, all of what Apostle Peter described as our great salvation
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.640]   accomplished by God, these are the things that's causing great joy even, even when there's
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640]   trials.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   Okay?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   Now, I want to ask a question.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.480]   When you take a look at this passage, he describes the trials that they go through and there's
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   almost a comparison.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.940]   There's a comparison between the trials and the joy that he sees in the people.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.280]   In verse six through nine, or six through eight, let's ask this question.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.560]   How does Peter describe their joy?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.120]   And then we're going to try continual audience participation here.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   Take a look at the passage, verse six and then verse eight also.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.560]   How does he describe the joy when they have this joy in the work of God?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.480]   So just, you don't have to even raise your hand, just yell it out what you see in the
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   passage.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   Inexpressible.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   Great.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:37.840]   What else do you see?
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   Filled with glory.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   Anything else?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:53.240]   Okay.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.840]   One of the things that we see just in verse six is this kind of idea of greatly rejoice,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   right?
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   So go ahead and list those things down.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.680]   All right?
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.800]   Now, in terms of this great rejoicing, let's talk about this a little bit.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:17.680]   The kind of joy that Apostle Peter is describing here, there's a sense in which we, for us,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.200]   there's like different synonyms that we can use too.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   We can be happy and then we could be elated, right?
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.620]   In the Greek terminology for this word, for greatly rejoice, there's two different words
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.040]   I want to highlight.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   I'm not going to even try to pronounce the first one.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.240]   The second one is kairo, okay?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   Two different terms used for joy.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.080]   Many passages in the scriptures use kairo on the side.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   Agaleao.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.240]   I think it's agaleao.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.160]   This is talking about the kind of like jump for joy, okay?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.560]   This is talking about something that's where it's causing you an immense amount of intense
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.880]   joy and elation.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.160]   And the reason why I bring this up is because the way that he's talking about this passage,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   what's kind of interesting is he describes it as something that people that he's talking
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.280]   to is already possessing.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.880]   Did you notice that?
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.680]   He's not saying like, "Ah, you know, I know it's super impossible for all of us and I
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.880]   know it goes contrary to what's normal, but can you guys please be happy?"
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   No.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.720]   What he's saying is, "Although you're going through all this stuff, you are happy, right?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.760]   You have this joy."
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.920]   And I wanted to highlight that because I think a lot of times when we go through difficulty
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.720]   and we go through hardship and someone says something to the extent of like, "Ah, but
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   we need to have, we need to rejoice always," or, "We need to have a sense of still contentment
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.640]   and thankfulness in it."
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.960]   Do we sometimes respond to that with like, "Yeah, but that's probably, you're saying
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   that because you probably haven't suffered much."
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.040]   You know?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.360]   Or do we actually believe that's possible?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.320]   Is it possible to come out of suffering with an immense gratitude and joy?
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.400]   Rejoicing.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.640]   Now what's really interesting about this is as he adds that kind of stuff, that in verse
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.920]   six and eight, putting it together, there's this inexpressible joy, too much for words
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.160]   almost, and there's glorious joy, full of glory, right?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.720]   And when I look at that, I don't know, when I read it, I wondered, "Is Apostle Peter being
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   sarcastic?"
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.840]   And it's kind of like, right now, because I haven't exercised in a long time, if I go
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.720]   on the basketball court, I'm just like hurting and I'm super slow.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.600]   And if someone was like, "Ha ha, you're so fast," you know, I'd be like, "You be quiet,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.840]   it's been a while, alright?"
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   Is it that kind of sarcasm?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.800]   And it's like, "Oh, you're so happy."
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.000]   No, I don't think so.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.080]   Apostle Peter is continuing to encourage a group of Christians who are expressing joy
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   in the circumstance, and then he's adding to it further encouragement as he goes.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:04.480]   Now for us, if perhaps this concept of great joy, not just a little bit of joy, not just
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.600]   like, "Yeah, I'm content," but this kind of like, "Wow, yes!"
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.140]   If that seems a little far-fetched, I think Apostle Peter adds to it.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.120]   So let me go on a little bit, okay?
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.760]   So there was the verse eight inexpressible joy.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.160]   Let's take a look at verse nine through 12.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   In verse nine through 12, he says, "Obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:36.320]   your souls, as to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.080]   to you made careful inquiries, or searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.040]   or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as he predicted the sufferings
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.640]   of Christ and the glories to follow.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.840]   It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.480]   which now have been announced to you through those who preach the gospel to you by the
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:06.640]   Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look."
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.120]   Now I want to ask you a question, and cause you guys to just think about it, okay?
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.920]   Why is Apostle Peter, who desires the people, the Christians, who are experiencing suffering
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.480]   yet happy, and he desires them to be even more happy, and remember he said last time,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.040]   "I want you to have grace and peace to the fullest."
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.720]   How does talking about the prophets looking into this, and the angels looking into this,
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.600]   contribute to them being more overjoyed?
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.320]   You guys get my question?
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.360]   How does the fact that prophets were making careful inquiries, and how does the fact that
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   angels are looking contribute to adding to their joy?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.200]   Take a moment to think about that, okay?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   And then, let me have a brave soul.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   What do you guys think?
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Say that one more time.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.760]   Okay.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.720]   So the people know they have this salvation?
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   Okay okay.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Okay.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:40.920]   So for the people, obviously, from the experience of the Christian, yeah, like the salvation
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.200]   that Apostle Peter is highlighting is something they already have.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.520]   And then so I want to kind of further the question here a little bit, but how does the
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.400]   angels looking into this, and the prophets from long ago looking into the salvation,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   contribute to the joy of the Christian?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Yes.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   So if God's word is described as the revelation of God, then there was even in heaven a mystery
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   of salvation ready to be revealed at the right time.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   The angels were anticipating the native breath, and curious to see how will God glorify himself
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   in this unjust situation.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   So these Christians got to live at the apex.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   They got to experience the creme de la creme, the culminating point of the revelation of
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   Christ, the mystery of the salvation, of the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   And they got to experience the salvation of the native breath.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.100]   And I just want you guys to think about that a little bit, okay. Are any of you guys actually
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:58.040]   Chicago Coast fans in here? Okay. Well you guys know the story, right?
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:05.420]   I mean absolutely. Anything that is so long-awaited, you know, highly anticipated. Something that
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:12.760]   there has been great expectation for, longing for. The fulfillment is fantastic, right?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.180]   Now for perhaps, sometimes when we fail to appreciate something, perhaps we don't get
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:24.760]   that. That this has been a mystery, hidden for generations, coming to fulfillment, the
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.680]   fruition of time, and many steps having to accomplish prior to this time, and at the
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.840]   pinnacle moment, they get to have this. Now I want you to think about another concept.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.560]   So the first thing you should jot down right underneath this is this idea of this long-awaited
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:48.720]   anticipation. But the second word I want you guys to write down is exclusivity. Exclusivity.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:56.840]   Bless you. Okay. Why am I talking about that? Because the prophets were looking into this,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.040]   the angels were looking into this, and the thing about it is, are, I want to ask an interesting
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:08.880]   question here, are angels privy to this salvation? Please turn your Bibles over to Hebrews chapter
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.840]   2. I've preached this passage before like three or four times, but every time I look
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:21.640]   at it, I'm just still floored. I'm in awe and absolutely in wonder. Okay? Hebrews chapter
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:34.000]   2, and we're going to start in verse 14 and go down to verse 17. Okay? Now, in this passage,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.320]   he talks about why Jesus had to be fully man, and it speaks to the glory of Christ. But
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:47.640]   this is what he says, verse 14, "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.360]   he himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death he might render powerless
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.040]   him who had the power of death, that is the devil, and might free those who through fear
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:05.120]   of death were subject to slavery all their lives." Look at this, okay? Look at this.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   "For surely he does not give help to angels, but he gives help to the descendants of Abraham.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.000]   Therefore, he had to be made like his brethren in all things so that he might become a merciful
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.840]   and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God." Did you catch that? The angels are
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.520]   looking into this like, "Wow, what is God doing? When is this happening? What is he
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.880]   doing for them?" And they realize God is not serving the angels. God is serving who? Our
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:43.720]   kind. And you ask the question, what we have is not just cheap and privy to all. It is
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:50.200]   actually incredibly exclusive to those God has desired and chosen to help, namely the
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:56.080]   children of Abraham. And I wonder if some of the angels are looking on with jealousy
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:03.600]   even. This is an incredible unique privilege for the Christian who by faith can see an
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.280]   incredible huge long plan salvation plan of God that is incredibly exclusive for those
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:18.080]   who have been chosen. Does that contribute to the joy of what we have? Of course. My
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   goodness. My God did not have to help everybody. He actually was not obligated to give anything.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.840]   But when he decided to help, then he obligated himself by which his son, Jesus Christ would
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:39.160]   have to come and by obligation then be like us in every way, in flesh, and to make every
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.800]   requirement to take on that obligation when he absolutely did not have to because he chose
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.600]   to help us. What an amazing truth of the gospel. So I say, Apostle Peter is adding to their
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:19:00.040]   joy by adding to the value of salvation. What it is you have in the work of God. Right?
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:11.400]   And in that he says, you rejoice. You rejoice. So by way of application, sometimes at looking
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:18.760]   at certain other passages of the scripture, when people suffer, there is almost this misconception.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.480]   Am I supposed to be glad in my suffering? You don't have to be like a sadomasochist.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:34.880]   No, you're not just be like, yeah, hey, I got hit today. No, it's even though, right?
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   Even though these things are happening to you, you have such a great salvation. You
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   have a joy that is inexpressible, full of glory, is great, and it doesn't depend on
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:52.280]   any circumstance in your life. Remember how I said last week, you have such a great salvation.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:59.920]   You have a solution. You have a joy that supersedes even the solution of removing all pain. You
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:06.780]   have an incredible salvation in Christ. So that's our first part. And when we perceive
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:14.120]   that this salvation is so grand, then our perspective of salvation falls into place.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:21.600]   Right? When we perceive the value, the depth of the salvation that we have, then our perception
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.960]   of the difficulties, the hardships, now all of a sudden come into place. I want to ask
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:34.060]   you this question. How does Apostle Peter describe, so let's jump back to our passage.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:43.160]   How does Apostle Peter describe the suffering and the hardships that people are experiencing?
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   Let's just look at them and kind of throw them out again.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:21:07.340]   Okay, various. Okay, you have various trials. What else? You guys can jot these in, okay?
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:20.060]   Various trials. These are the toss-up one, guys, where you just have to list them from
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:25.940]   the passage. So let's just throw them out. So there's various, and then there's distressing,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:33.800]   okay, which in the NIV, it kind of says it's grief, right? So there's painful. It's painful.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:47.220]   Anything else? For a little while, and then if necessary, right? So let's jot those four
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:56.420]   things down. It was various trials. It was distressing for a little while, and then if
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:02.520]   necessary, right? So I said just a moment ago, he began by describing the greatness
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.980]   of salvation, and then he described after that the description of the kind of experiences
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.940]   that they're having. Now, if you read that for a little bit, I don't know if that kind
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.740]   of sounds like, "Hmm, is he kind of diminishing their experience?" You know, someone's like,
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.820]   "Oh, I have such a hard time, and I'm having such a difficult day," and then the pastor
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.380]   goes like, "You know what the Bible says? It's like light and momentary suffering. It's
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:33.180]   light, man," and you're like, "All right, I'm never talking to you again," you know?
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.340]   Because you kind of, you know, it's kind of almost patronizing, and it's almost like diminishing
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:43.560]   their experience. Is that what Apostle Peter is doing? No, it is not. He's putting it into
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.600]   perspective. When he says this is various trials, yeah, I mean, he gets it. He gets
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.960]   that people are going through lots of different kinds of trials. The word for various trials
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.160]   is multi-colored in the Greek. So he knows, just like we experience, for you guys, too,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.080]   sometimes when things go bad, you know how the ADM goes, when it rains, it pours? Yeah,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.520]   sometimes it's like multifaceted, coming at different angles, and it's like, "Man, just
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.220]   when I thought one thing was over." And he describes how, yes, we do experience grief.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:21.240]   We do experience pain, and yes, it is distressing, but then he also describes how it is for a
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:27.080]   little while. This is temporary, right? It's not going to last forever. As a matter of
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.680]   fact, we're hoping in Christ, who is going to bring that day when there is no tear. And
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:39.240]   lastly, if it's necessary, saying, "Even the suffering, though, it's purposeful." Okay?
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:48.000]   Oh, shoot. I totally forgot to use this thing. Okay, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and then bam,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.600]   bam, bam, bam, bam. Okay. You know what? I don't know if I'm going to use a PowerPoint
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.720]   next time, because I forget about it. Okay. So the reason why I'm describing this to us
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   is because there's an important question we have to ask, right? When you experience suffering,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.360]   when you experience difficulty, and maybe even persecution because of your faith, how
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:19.040]   is that supposed to look then in terms of your response? Right? The reason why I ask
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.520]   that question is because I think sometimes when I ask people, when we talk about suffering,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.680]   it's like they always kind of say, "Oh, I feel like this, but I know I should, and I
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.640]   know I should," and they almost have to like justify why they feel bad, and they're like,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:39.880]   "Oh, but I'm okay." And I'm like, "We don't have to, you know, do that, because truthfully
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:46.240]   speaking in terms of our experience, I mean, like, we don't have to feel like, 'Oh, yeah,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.680]   I'm supposed to be happy when I suffer.'" Jesus wept when the people around him were
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.320]   suffering. Jesus looked at the entire city, and he was just like stirred in his heart,
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:04.200]   and he said, "Oh my gosh, I wish, I wish you were different. I wish that you would be receptive
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.880]   so I can bring you in like a mother, you know, hen." Remember that? And remember before the
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:17.000]   cross he would say, "My soul is troubled within me." He's saying like, "My guts and insides
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.880]   are being all turned around." Are we not supposed to feel anything? I remember actually listening
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.760]   to a pastor's sermon one time, and he gave this, you know, he was teaching on suffering,
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   and then he gave this analogy when his child was sick, when he was super young. His child
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.560]   had seizures, and he was talking about how they were at the hospital, and his wife was
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.920]   losing it. She was just weeping and bawling in the waiting room, and she just couldn't
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.880]   hold it together. And then he kind of had, he said he had to admonish his wife to keep
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.280]   it together because we believe in stronger, better things. And I was like, "Dang." You
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.960]   know? I don't know if at that moment I would have been like, "Hey, keep it together because
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   we're stronger than that," you know? Because the fact of the matter is, in our experience,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.800]   we have a full gamut of various trials that we go through. And we have a full gamut of
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.200]   various experiences. And sometimes they are distressing. Sometimes they are troubling,
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.400]   and they're incredibly painful. Right? But should we have no tears? Should we have no,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   you know, like, like working through the questions? No, that is not the case. There is a process.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   There is a spiritual fight where we see what we see with our physical eyes, and then we
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.760]   start to consider, we start to remember, and we start to rehearse what we know. Just yesterday,
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.280]   actually, Pastor Peter and I were digging dirt with Eugene and stuff over at the church,
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.360]   and we just started talking about this. Is it weird if we're like more happy when things
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:51.800]   are good and sad when things are bad? And then Pastor Peter brought up a great passage.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.960]   In the book of James, chapter 1, he says, "Consider it all joy when you face various
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:03.080]   trials." Right? Now, on a knee-jerk reaction, it's like, "So you should be happy." No. He
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:09.040]   says, "Consider." Which means you have to do a work. If some of you guys are frustrated,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.720]   like, "I don't know, man. I don't feel that joy when I'm hurt." And it's like, "Yeah,
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.800]   because in order to feel the joy, there's actually work required." And what is that
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:23.320]   work? It's a spiritual work. It's a spiritual work of prayer. It's a spiritual work with
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   grappling with spiritual truth. It's a spiritual work of considering and remembering. Please
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.320]   turn your Bibles over to Hebrews, chapter 10. Hebrews, chapter 10, verse 32 through
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   36. And the author of this book essentially says the same. So, Hebrews 10, verse 32 through
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   36. He says, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened, you endured
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:03.960]   a great conflict of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.980]   and tribulations, and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated. For you showed
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:14.600]   sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.520]   you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one. Therefore, do not throw
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   away your confidence, which has great reward, for you have need of endurance, so that when
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised." So, there is a work here
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:38.800]   of remembering, of knowing, and looking forward to the reward. Your joy is not simply in the
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.920]   fact that, like, "Okay, I get to suffer." Because otherwise, later on in the book, he
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   says, "Why are y'all suffering for doing silly things? If you're gonna suffer, you better
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   suffer for good. If you suffer for bad, then God's gonna judge you too." Right? So, he
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.560]   says here, "Your joy is not found in just the circumstances. Your joy is found when
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.280]   you are remembering, considering, and engaging in the spiritual battle, spiritual eyes and
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   spiritual faith, versus physical sight as we live." Okay? So, that's verse 6. Took us
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.880]   about 30 minutes. We've got a bunch more to go. Now, I'm gonna kinda push everything together
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.840]   too, so we're not gonna be here too long. Okay? But, let's take a moment to think about
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   this, right? There are times when we experience suffering, and then we try. We try really
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:37.880]   hard. We contemplate, we try to remember, and we try to pray. Now, here's an interesting
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   thing. A mind prayer is that every single one of us would learn, because if we didn't
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.680]   go through a bunch of suffering already, we're probably gonna go through it in the future,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   right? At some point or another, we're gonna go through it. That we would be prepared and
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:59.680]   know to continue to pursue rejoicing and being grateful to Christ, even in the midst of dire
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.600]   circumstances. Because, if after going through that process, if after trying to remember,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   if after being counseled and after being instructed and reminded, you find no joy, then that's
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:21.080]   an incredibly kind of alarming and concerning place to be. Because in that moment, there
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.480]   is no proof of faith. And that's what we're getting at in the next verse. Let's take a
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   look at verse 7. Okay? Let's take a look at verse 7.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   Okay. In verse 7 it says, "So that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:51.840]   which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Now, if you take a look, just for
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.800]   the sake of visual effect, typically what I do is, again, I try to diagram and break
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.840]   down the phrases. But the way that this kind of, there's a, you know, parenthetical clause
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.040]   right there. Parenthetical meaning it's just kind of squished into the main sentence. But
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.680]   if we just take a look at the main sentence, it should read, "So that the proof of your
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:23.400]   faith may be found to result in praise and glory and honor." That's the main phrase.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   Right? And so what you find there is a purpose clause. "So that." Anytime I see a purpose
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.000]   clause I always circle that. "So that," and then I highlight that because I want to remember
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.520]   that. He says, "You have this rejoicing and you have this inexpressible joy even in the
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:47.360]   midst of suffering." And then he says this, "So that the proof of your faith may be found
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   to result in praise, glory, and honor." Now, I want to ask you guys this question, okay?
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:01.160]   And this one, you guys can just take one minute to discuss it in your group. What do you consider
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   to be proof of faith? Both existent in this passage, so kind of looking at verses 6 through
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.080]   12, what do you think is considered the proof of faith? But in terms of other things you
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   can list that come to mind, what is a proof of faith? Okay? Go.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   [pause]
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   [pause]
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   [pause]
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   [pause]
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   [pause]
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:04.080]   [pause]
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   [pause]
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   [pause]
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   [pause]
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   [pause]
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   [pause]
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   [pause]
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   [pause]
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   [pause]
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   [pause]
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   Okay, great. So can you guys just shout out some of the answers that you guys discussed,
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   you know, throughout there? Any volunteers? One more time?
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   Repentance. Great. Repentance as a proof of faith. Good. What else?
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   They loved Jesus. And let's talk about that a little bit, okay? Let's take a look at,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   oh, did I miss something? Okay. Let's take a look at verse 8, okay? Let's take a look
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   at verse 8 and it says, "Though you have not seen Him, you love Him. And though you do
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   not see Him now, but you believe in Him. You greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   full of glory." Okay? When you look at that, there is an interesting thing happening there,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   okay? To me, if I was preparing a sermon, rather than taking all of these passages,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   I would just take verse 7 and 8, sandwiches together, and I would say, "This is the proof
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   of your faith." The proof of your faith is that even in the midst of suffering, you,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   and even in the midst of a moment when God's love seems most unreal, right? That even in
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   those moments, you still love Him. It's not just the fact that, like, "I don't see you,
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   but okay, I'll try." No, it's what they're experiencing to them on a humanistic level
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   goes contrary. "God, if you love me, why are you letting me go through this?" That's the
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   kind of question we ask in our day. Oh, God, and a lot of people these days, it's not even
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   that. They don't even have to go through suffering. It's just if they're not tall enough, they
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   don't have enough skill, if they don't have enough money, their automatic question is,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   "God, why'd you make me like this? Don't you love me?" But in their time, they're actually
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   being persecuted. So it's not just simply, "I don't see you." It's, "I see contrary, but
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   I love you. I believe you." Right? That's the essence of our Christian faith. What else
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   is there in terms of proof of our faith? Yes, Denise? One more time? Bearing spiritual fruits,
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   right? That there is actual transformation. That one person who goes from angry to more
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   gentle, right? What else? Obedience. A submission of the will. Before we were Christians, our
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   greatest will is our own. After you're a Christian, we continue to submit to the will of God.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   What else is there? Anything? Praise. Excellent. When you are a genuine Christian and your
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   eyes are open to the greatness of God, you will be in wonder. You will be in awe, right?
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   And these are the things that need to rise. But today, what we're talking about is these
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   are the things that need to rise even in the midst of unfavorable circumstances. Even in
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   the midst when there's a huge hurdle and praising is hard, when change is hard, when there's
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   temptation to continue to revert back, right? Because that's what we're talking about today.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:46.080]   That even though you're experiencing these things, what you have is unexplicable joy.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   That the joy itself is a proof in and of itself that although what should be there is grief,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   disenchantment, a sense of bitterness, a sense of I give up, but rather there's joy there.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   And you know what's really interesting is even the word proof, right? Even the word
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   proof. What's really interesting is the NIV kind of just kind of spells it out for you.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   It says, "All these trials, these have come to you so that your faith may be proved genuine."
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   What's really interesting about that is there's like two interesting words that are at play.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   The term for genuine or proof is a term that's used often in metal work where people would
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   apply intense heat and you know that process of purifying the metal and boiling it and
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   letting all the jaws come to the top. The residue, meaning the remaining pure stuff,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   that's the term used for genuine or proof. It's the evidence. It's the remaining, lasting,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   residual, genuine part. Right? He says, "Let that come out." And so God is using the
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   suffering. God is using the circumstance and those are the moments where we're going to
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   see our faith tested. When we're going to see our faith tested. And by application for
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   us, I want us to think about that. And let's really put our own hearts on the table here.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   Okay? He's saying that in this moment, what's really, really good is that your faith be
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   purified. But sometimes in our lives when we experience suffering, we're challenged.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   We're challenged because in suffering we are challenged about what we want, what we seek
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   as a solution, what we're desiring in the moments of suffering. A lot of times what
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   we want is fixed, like a quick fix. What we want is a solution. What we want is a pragmatic
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   way out. And that challenges your faith. Right? That automatically challenges your faith.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   Because when we do that, when we're asking God for a solution, we might be asking for
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   something that is completely contrary to what he's doing for our faith. Because for our
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   faith, he is challenging us to still believe when we don't see it. And so yes, sometimes
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   we're asking God, "Show me. Can you change me? Can you challenge me?" But he's saying,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   "I want you to believe even when I'm not showing you." Right? "I want you to believe even if
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   it's not there. Even if it's not tangible. Even if it's not close." Remember, it's Christ
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   who said in John chapter 20 verse 29, he says to him, "Because you have seen me, have you
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   believed?" He's talking to Thomas. And then he says, "Blessed are they who did not see
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   yet believe." When Jesus said, "Blessed are they who believe when they don't see," he
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   completely radically challenges our value system. Right? What's good for us is actually
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   being able to have a firm footing when we see it. When I land on something. He says,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   "No, blessed are you when your faith is so strong you don't need to see it with your
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   eyes." It's also Christ in Matthew chapter 5 in the Beatitudes who said, "Blessed are
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.080]   those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.080]   of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.080]   kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you." So, in Christ's
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   eyes, looking at our circumstances, what does he desire as a result? So that what? That
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   your faith would be bolstered. That your belief would be strengthened. That you would come
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   out with an assurance and a confirmation and a conviction. I believe my God. Yes, all
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   this stuff might go haywire, but I absolutely believe my God and I love him. That's what
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   he wants us to come out with. Let's not ask for other stuff then. Yes, we could still
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   ask for things to pass. Yes, we could ask for God to change circumstances, pray for
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   when there's physical amen for healing and provision and all of that because he's our
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   Father. But if his answer is by necessity, right? If this is necessary, then God desires
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   our faith to be purified. That's what I'm saying. And so, in kind of wrapping up, let's
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   move to the next section. If you notice in verse 7, he says, "So that the proof of your
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   faith being more precious than gold, which is perishable even though tested by fire."
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   And he says this, "May be found to result in praise, glory, and honor." Praise, glory,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.080]   and honor. And I wanted you to ask the question, I wanted to ask the question, it's just a
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   simple question. Whose praise, glory, and honor is Apostle Peter talking about? He says
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   later on, you know, after experiencing all this, there's going to be a result. It's going
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   to be praise, it's going to be glory, and honor. Whose praise, glory, and honor is he
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   talking about? Correct. Yes. Yes. That's a good question. You know, I mean, I'm not
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   going to draw a strict line, because in the end, well if I answer that, then I'm just
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   giving you the answer. Tricky, tricky. A lot of things in the Bible, it's not so clear
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   cut. I mean, I'm talking about my sermon would have been proof of your faith, but I could
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   have done it sources of joy, sources of, you know, and then the other way, backwards, right?
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   But, so anyway, alright, thanks for ruining my question. I'm just kidding. Well, let's
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   think about this a little bit. What naturally, the reason why I ask it is because what naturally
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   we presume to be exclusively for God. Who else deserves praise, glory, and honor? God
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:48.080]   alone, right? You're taught, like, God alone deserves praise, glory, and honor. And that's
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   what, that's your knee jerk reaction when you read that passage. So sometimes, again,
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   if you just read it in cursory, it's like, all this stuff is happening, he causes you
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   to rejoice, and what I'm, God is praised, amen. And you move on. But in this passage,
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   you read that again, and you just kind of realize, like, hmm, that's really interesting.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   He says that this may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   of Jesus Christ, right? What's really interesting about that passage is there's a kind of succession,
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   and I don't want to show it here, okay? Oh no, I forgot again. Okay, here, praise, glory,
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   and honor. Let's take a look at this. There's a little paragraph there where I have arrows,
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   and there is a sequence of connection, relationships between phrases that I put together, and if
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   you guys observe it, you know, see if you guys just see it, some of it's really obvious,
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:57.080]   and some of it, you know, we kind of gleaning from the passage here. Well, first he begins
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   with, "You greatly rejoice," right? And then we noticed that he introduced the next part
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   by saying, "So that." So he says, "You greatly rejoice, so that the proof of your
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   faith." The proof of your faith results in, results in what? Glory, praise, glory, honor.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   Obtaining, as a salvation, as the outcome, salvation of your souls. This whole entire
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:34.080]   section is a progressive thought of what faith is doing for you. Is it not? I could phrase
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   this in another way. Why is your faith so great? Because it was in accordance to God's
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   plan, that by faith you would receive everything He promised you. So when He commends you,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   He commends you for your faith, because when you have faith, then God accomplishes His
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   masterful intent, which is to thoroughly bless you in Christ, simply through faith. And by
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   faith, you have all of this. Praise, glory, honor, salvation of your soul. Right? Now
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:18.080]   to me, that's quite profound. Because God does, interestingly enough, commend us. We
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:24.080]   know Jesus Christ, who said, who taught, that for those who serve well, God is going
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:32.080]   to say, "Well done, good and faithful servant." We know that God is going to reward, richly
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   reward, those who continue to give and serve the Lord, especially those who would even
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   sacrifice their lives for the Lord. Now let me ask you a question. What does this teach
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   us about God, who commends genuine faith? And I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   What does this teach us about God, who so desired to give us the inheritance, who so
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   desired to give us the resurrection and being born again, who desired to give us His protection,
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   who desires to give us honor and share His glory with us, simply upon faith. What does
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   that teach us about our God? Let's jot some of these down. I would say, "My, what a glorious
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   and unique God." Because He's God. What God gives recognition to His creatures. What
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   master over a slave has, "Hey, let's have slaves appreciation day. Everybody blow balloons
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   and let's like start, you know, bring up the, you know, slave of the month or something
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   like that." No. Why? Because they're only doing what they're expected to do. What Lord
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   continues to share His space, His wealth with His servants. Wow, God is unique. And wow,
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   God is generous. Scripture says, you know, when Apostle Paul was preaching to the people
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   of Athens, he was like, "You guys are so silly. You guys put down these altars and
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   you guys give your altars food and you guys put all this stuff and you guys make temples
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:20.080]   and stuff. God, who is in the heavens, is not served by you." Why? Because He don't
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:30.080]   need you. God's not using you. God's not benefiting by your services and your sacrifice.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   But what does that tell us? By Him wanting to give His promises simply upon faith, what
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   a generous God we have. Right? And what's more, God is truly loving. Because to me,
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   when God wants faith, it's like saying earlier, God earlier, sorry, in verse 8, one of the,
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   you know, profound and emphatic proofs of faith was that we love Him. So when He commends
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   good faith, what is He actually commending? Love. What does God desire to have between
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   Him and His people? Love. What is He orchestrating? What has He accomplished through all this
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:24.080]   salvation? He has accomplished a love relationship by which He is pouring out His blessing simply
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   upon those who are having confidence and not throwing that away. What an amazing, loving
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   God we have. And I think in that, we rejoice. It's not in the circumstance. It is not in
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:45.080]   like, "Hey, there's going to be better days." No! Days aren't getting better. I don't know
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   anybody who's like, you know, much older who's saying like, "Oh yeah, yeah, just wait and
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   it's all going to get better." You know? Life just gets harder and harder. We don't have
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   confidence in that. We have confidence in an amazing God in whom we can rejoice to the
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   fullest. Amen? Let's take some time to pray.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   Father, Lord, we thank you so much for your salvation. God, we realize maybe, you know,
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   Lord, we sometimes just don't appreciate
