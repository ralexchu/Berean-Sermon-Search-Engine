[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   Good morning, my name is Christine Chan and I am a second year at UC Irvine and this is
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.080]   my testimony.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.080]   Introduced to Christianity at a young age, I followed my parents to church, hearing about
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.880]   a God that loves me so much that he sent his one and only son to die for our sins.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.600]   However my desire to even attend was always found in my friends.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.720]   Not knowing the true gravity and consequences of sin, I chose to ignore the worries about
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.680]   the future and live in the present, enjoying every moment with the friendships that I had.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.960]   I continued to gain head knowledge about God and the Bible, but I never chose to apply
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.760]   any of it into my life.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.480]   In middle school I joined a Christian ministry that meant to sing, dance, and worship every
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   week.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.280]   Throughout high school I became insecure about everything about myself, as I put what people
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.560]   thought of me before what God thought of me.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.680]   I mimicked other people in the way I dressed, talked, walked, and laughed, wearing a mask
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.740]   that hid the true me.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.760]   As I learned to say and do the right things to be received as a "Christian," I became
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.560]   two-faced and lived a double life.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240]   I was even confirmed and therefore proclaimed to the church that I had accepted Christ and
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560]   believed that he is Lord and Savior of my life, and yet my life was not reflecting Christ's
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240]   when I was alone.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.720]   While those around me had a burning passion for God, his love for us, and how he saved
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.480]   them, I was faking it.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.920]   And the scariest part of all this was that I had done it subconsciously.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.680]   I did not know that I had lost my identity and my way to Jesus.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.480]   Being surrounded by believers all my life, I was secured in a bubble, and my faith had
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.320]   unknowingly become something that was not of my own.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.400]   During the quarantine of 2020, I realized all this in addition to forgetting what it
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.200]   was like to love, as I felt apathetic to any love shown to me.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.120]   My heart was hardened to anything my community said to and did for me.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.080]   When my cousin invited me out to Berean, I was amazed at how rooted in the Bible Berean
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.560]   Community Church was, for I was never taught how to properly study the Bible, let alone
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.160]   directed to read it.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   However, the more I came out, I stood in awe and wonder at how marvelous the Lord is, and
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.040]   how much he truly loves us despite our imperfections.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.560]   Through some of the leaders and friends from college ministry, I was able to hear and receive
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.200]   the gospel, along with their testimonies on how their lives were completely changed.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.040]   It always encouraged me and left me wondering when it would happen for me.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.260]   Learning more about God, I prayed that he would reveal himself to me and truly open
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.800]   my eyes to his glory, but I left all the work for God to do.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.920]   I needed to do my part and surrender my everything to him, but I couldn't let go of the things
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.960]   that I thought were keeping me together, but in reality were tearing me apart.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.360]   There was no date or time in which I accepted Christ, but gradually within the past year,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   as I participated in small group accountability and Friday night Bible study, God's love was
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.220]   exposed to me, and in turn, my love for him and desire to know him grew exponentially.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.600]   I learned to love and what it felt like to love.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.480]   I learned that love is different for everyone, and that I cannot have the same standards
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.240]   or expectations of love as the world.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   The more time I spent studying his word, the smaller I felt towards God's holiness and
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.400]   his magnificence.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.560]   I realized how much sin had invaded my life, how it clouded my views on God, and how much
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.120]   I needed the Lord to save me from my hopeless state, which led me to true repentance.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.240]   A verse that I have been meditating on is 1 John 4, verses 7 through 8.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.280]   "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and everyone who loves is born
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920]   of God and knows God.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.800]   The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   Thank you.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   (audience applauding)
