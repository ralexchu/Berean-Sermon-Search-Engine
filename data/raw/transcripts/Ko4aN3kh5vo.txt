[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.180]   Hello, my name is Tasha.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.200]   I am a student at CSU Long Beach.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.520]   My testimony starts off like a lot of people.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.240]   I grew up going to church, serving in the children's ministry, going to youth groups and youth camps.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.880]   I was doing all the right things and believed that Jesus came down to save us from our sin, but it was all just mindless believing.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.900]   I have gotten baptized before, the summer between 7th and 8th grade.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.880]   But looking back, I did not truly understand.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:57.940]   I did not truly understand what it meant to be baptized and the most important factor, I had yet to call Jesus, not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:04.000]   High school came and I was constantly trying to find things to blame God for and avoiding my own sin.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:13.480]   I blamed Him for why I did not have the perfect family with two parents, why He let my biological parents give me up, money like all of my friends' families did, the list goes on.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.860]   I was extremely ungrateful for what God had provided me with, allowing me to even grow up in a loving home that taught God's word.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.640]   Going to college, God placed wonderful people in my life, exemplifying His love and mercy.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.220]   I was learning not only that I needed to have faith, but also what it means to walk with the Lord and surrender all things to Him.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:40.540]   I was doing all of these things and wanted to seem like the perfect Christian, but in the back of my mind, it still felt artificial.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.420]   However, in my avoidance self, I pushed it back and kept going on.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.360]   I was comfortable with where I was.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.640]   I desired things like relationships, praise from peers, money.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.400]   I still cared about what others thought of me rather than God.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.280]   I recognized all these things I desired but not of God, and it was sin.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.920]   But I still could not completely understand how someone could forgive all the terrible things I had done.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:07.820]   Talking with older sisters in church and AACF, I was challenged for the first time in my faith.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.200]   I spent a lot of time reflecting over and asking questions.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:19.220]   I was finally able to be in the Word, not just to gain head knowledge for when I'm talking to others, but to truly know who God is.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.620]   Romans 3 says,
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.300]   Romans 3, 23, 24 says,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:38.960]   I realized at this point I was focusing so much on how I was a sinner and forgot the whole reason God sent down His Son to live on earth and eventually die on the cross.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.260]   It was to save us from our sin.
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.200]   I had to die to myself and recognize how much I needed God.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:50.600]   As I move on with life, I am constantly learning what it means to walk a Christian life as a daughter of the Father,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.460]   and I can rejoice in His love and the promises that He has fulfilled.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:28:00.940]   He has shown me so much of my sin by constantly humbling me and showing me what true confession and repentance is.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:06.640]   I can say with full confidence that my hope is in the Lord, and He is not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:36.060]   I can say with full confidence that my hope is in the Lord, and He is not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.

[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:47.440]  .

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:21.540]   I can say with full confidence that my hope is in the Lord, and He is not only my Savior, but Lord over my life.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.220]   One thing, if Jesus is going to say something like that, there will be some description, right?
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.520]   This is what made Him so great.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.120]   He just says, He's the greatest, because He was a man of conviction.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.180]   Were there no other people who was a man of conviction?
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.900]   Wasn't Elijah a man of conviction?
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.440]   And he didn't give himself to luxury.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.680]   Wasn't Elijah, didn't he also live in caves?
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.300]   Weren't there plenty of prophets and people who gave their life?
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.840]   Weren't there people who preached well and was able to do many great things for God?
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.440]   What makes judgment?
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.800]   John the Greatest.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:59.880]   It doesn't spell out for us, but the only thing that we know about John the Baptist is his proximity to Christ.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.980]   It's his proximity to Christ.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.260]   Everyone pointed to Jesus coming.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.320]   John the Baptist actually introduced Jesus personally.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:16.120]   If there's any distinction between anybody that was born, it's his proximity to Christ.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.740]   And that's what made him the greatest.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.420]   He was like the one, like...
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:26.780]   If you were to illustrate, like if you go to some concert,
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.080]   you would have a lesser known band come up and they would play
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.480]   to warm up the crowd so that the main event, whoever's coming,
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.700]   people paid the ticket to see, would come to see.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.860]   But his purpose is to open the act, get the people ready.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.040]   Well, that's what John the Baptist was to do.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:49.800]   He was come to do, to prepare the people so that hearts would be ready and receptive when Christ comes
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.320]   and they preach the same message.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.380]   John the Baptist came saying, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:59.140]   Jesus comes and takes the baton and Jesus opens his ministry by saying,
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.180]   repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.600]   And there was such a smooth transition, they couldn't distinguish between the two.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.760]   And that's why John the Baptist was the greatest.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.480]   Because of his proximity to Christ.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.740]   Now, now we know why John is the greatest.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.160]   But he also says, but in the kingdom of God,
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.540]   he is the least.
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.360]   He's the greatest and the least.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.580]   How is he the least?
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.960]   Who are the people in the kingdom of God he's referring to?
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.780]   He's referring to us in the new covenant.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:39.380]   John the Baptist was a unique prophet where he stood between the old and the new covenant.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:45.080]   He was the last of the covenant, last of the old covenant prophet that came
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.260]   who physically introduced Christ.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.840]   And then when Jesus shows up on the scene, he says,
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.120]   he must increase and I must.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:51.720]   Decrease.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.820]   And then he just disappears.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:58.620]   So what makes us better than John the Baptist?
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.640]   If John the Baptist is greater than David and Abraham and Elijah and Elisha,
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:08.600]   and then he ends it by saying, but he is the least compared to you in the kingdom.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.160]   He basically said, we're better than David.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.840]   We're better than Elijah.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.600]   We are.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.980]   Are we supposed to take that seriously?
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.020]   Really?
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:19.120]   Really?
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.780]   How are we better than John?
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.140]   How are we better than David?
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:32.020]   As John's proximity to Christ made him great,
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.540]   it is our proximity to Christ that he's talking about.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:42.880]   Not us, not our giftedness, not our talent, not our influence, but our proximity.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.940]   It says in Romans 6, 5,
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.040]   for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.780]   certainly we shall also be united.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.480]   We shall also be united in the likeness of his resurrection.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.140]   So whenever somebody gets baptized, it is not just a cleansing,
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.880]   it is a union with Christ in his death and his resurrection.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.300]   In 1 Corinthians 6, 17, it says,
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.960]   but the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.300]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 6, 19 to 20,
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.340]   or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.240]   whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.340]   For you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body,
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.340]   that you are not your own.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.200]   You have been crucified.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.440]   And we belong to him.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.360]   So what makes us so great is not that we were diamonds in the rough
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.900]   and somehow God was able to see beyond the roughness
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.640]   so that he can cleanse us off to see the inner value that we have.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.960]   What made John great was his proximity to Christ.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:45.240]   And what makes us greater than him is the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.580]   It is our union with Christ that makes him the least
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.140]   because he was a part of us.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:51.140]   He was a part of the Old Covenant.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.580]   Now, isn't that mind-blowing?
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.800]   That's why when John says in 1 John 3, 1,
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.740]   see how great the love of Father has bestowed on us.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.580]   I like the King James Version better when he says,
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:08.400]   behold, behold what manner of love the Father has given.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.340]   In other words, take some time to meditate and think
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.360]   what it is exactly that you have in Christ
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:19.820]   that God looks upon us and no longer sees who we are.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:25.020]   That you and I have been clothed with the righteousness of Christ
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:28.500]   so that now when God sees us, he sees his Son.
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.540]   So he's not saying we're greater than John.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:35.420]   He's saying his Son is greater than John.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.380]   Compared to his Son, he's the least.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.300]   That's what he's saying.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.460]   Because we have been covered by the righteousness of Christ
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.560]   because of our union with him.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.600]   So if this God was willing to give his Son,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.320]   how will he not along with him give us all other things?
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:58.700]   And that's why he says, behold, what manner of love the Father has given to us
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:02.560]   that we will be called the children of God and such we are.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.120]   And I mentioned this a long time ago.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   This is not from the Bible,
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.300]   but this used to hang at my parents' house when we were younger.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.060]   It says, happiness is not having what you want,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.840]   but happiness is wanting what you have.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.340]   See, if you live your life,
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:23.580]   if you're thinking joy, satisfaction, life comes from having what you want,
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.820]   you will live your life constantly in coveting,
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.020]   dissatisfied because you don't have what others have.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.840]   But true joy is recognizing what we have
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.780]   and wanting more of it.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.020]   Even though, I mean, that's not in the Bible.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.120]   Don't quote that and say, you know, it's in the Bible somewhere.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.560]   I got that from some clock.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.300]   But it was so profound that it just kind of stuck.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.180]   And I think it's very biblical.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.040]   At least the principle is so biblical
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:57.560]   that how can people who professes to believe this
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.560]   live the rest of their lives coveting something so trivial?
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.640]   It's like living in the biggest mansion
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.080]   and then looking outside the window and seeing that hut,
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.560]   saying, why can't I have that hut?
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.720]   Why can't I have that hut?
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.320]   I see people coming in and out of that hut.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.760]   Why can't I have that hut?
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.880]   While you're living in the mansion,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.240]   you see Christians who live their lives
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.120]   constantly coveting trivial things
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.800]   is a sign that they don't recognize what they have in Christ.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.540]   They don't know what they have in Christ.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.340]   How can we have been washed in the blood of Christ,
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.560]   the Son of God sacrificed for us,
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.020]   and we have eternal hope that when He comes,
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.560]   we're going to be glorified with Him
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.760]   and we're going to be in eternity in heaven forever
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.880]   where there's no death, no crying, no pain,
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.820]   that we're going to call Him,
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:48.740]   Abba, Father,
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:54.080]   and then to live the rest of our earthly life coveting,
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.820]   why can't I have that house?
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.100]   Why can't I have that car?
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.100]   Why can't I have that job?
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.140]   Why can't I have this?
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:05.760]   It's inconsistent with what you and I profess to believe.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.920]   Behold, behold,
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.880]   what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.260]   that you and I,
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.840]   will be greater than John the Baptist
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.680]   because of what He's given.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.060]   I pray that that truth would sink in
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.240]   and that we would live and worship God accordingly.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.260]   Let's pray.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:40.700]   Let's take a minute to come before the Lord in confession.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.220]   Confession of where we're at.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.160]   Confession of Christ.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:47.540]   Confession of love.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:53.520]   That this truth would continue to sink so deeply within
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.140]   that we would covet Christ more than anything else in this world.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:03.640]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:33.480]   Let's pray.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:33.600]   Let's pray.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:33.620]   Let's pray.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:13:03.600]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.700]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:03.760]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:03.800]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:03.840]   Let's pray.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:33.800]   Let's pray.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:14:03.780]   Let's pray.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:33.760]   Let's pray.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:15:03.740]   Let's pray.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:33.720]   Let's pray.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:16:03.700]   Let's pray.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:33.680]   Let's pray.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:17:03.660]   Let's pray.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:10.180]   Let's pray.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:10.740]   Let's pray.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:10.760]   Let's pray.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:10.800]   Let's pray.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:10.820]   Let's pray.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:14.780]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.680]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.920]   and the eternal love of God the Father
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.240]   strengthen, encourage, rebuke, and sanctify the church
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.460]   that we may all live according to the gospel that you've given us.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.100]   May the aroma of Christ go with us wherever you send us.
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:32.820]   Amen.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:57.280]   God sent his son, then called him Jesus, he came to love, heal and forgive, he lived
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.800]   and died to buy my life.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:32.780]   He died to buy my life.
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:52.140]   And all fear is gone because I know he holds the future and life is worth the living
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:57.820]   just because he lives.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:25.020]   And all fear is gone because he lives.
