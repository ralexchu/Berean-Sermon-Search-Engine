[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Good morning, church family.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   We're gonna go ahead and start our service.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I'm going to read this Psalm 45 to you,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   just as we reflect on this first song.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   It says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Therefore, God, your God, has anointed you
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   while the oil of joy above."
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   As we come before God,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   sometimes we get into a rote-ness of coming week to week,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   but I wanted to encourage us to remember why we're here,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   who we're approaching.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   He is the God of God, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So we're gonna sing this first song, "Before the Throne of God,"
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   that we reflect on who it is we worship,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   that we come with reverence and honor.

[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   All right, good morning. Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   We're gonna get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Pastor Nate's gonna come up, and he has an announcement for our college ministry.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Okay, so we're gonna be having a college welcome lunch.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   So especially for those of you who haven't been able to make it out to some of our weekday events,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and this, you've been coming out to our Sundays,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   at 1245, after second service is complete,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   in the building right across the way, this is a cafe.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   There's another part, we're gonna be having a sign right out that door to help you to identify where it is.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's gonna say Berean College Ministry.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But please come, and we're going to be giving you some lunch to eat.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   But beyond that, to help you to connect with some of the students,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   introduce you to our college staff, some of the visions of our church,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   and other ways that you can connect to our church as well, middle of the week.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   We have rites, ministries, and different service things going on.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And so, please, we wanna warmly invite you to that.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I hope you can join us there.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   All right, as you guys know, this week we have All Church Praise and Prayer.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   This Friday at 730, so we don't have our regular Bible study.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So please, we encourage you to come on time so we can get started right at 730.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Thanksgiving regional dinner.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   I've been told that we have enough homes now that's signed up.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But those of you who are planning to sign up, that we ask you to sign up today if possible,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   because they're already making--diving up the groups and to place people.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And again, I wanna just give you a heads up.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   If you sign up late, we're gonna have to plug you wherever it's open--Diamond Bar, LA, wherever it's open.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And so, if you sign up late, we're gonna have to just plug you into 20, 30, 40 miles away.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   So just come, and if you're planning to come, just sign up as soon as you can so we can get that going.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Trunk Formation, they said that they do have enough volunteers for the Trunk Formation.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   If you wanna just help out that day, serving food, making food, prizes, just dressing up, acting silly, whatever it is.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   If you wanna volunteer, you can do that, but they're also still asking for--if you wanna--
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   if you can't volunteer in that way, but you still want to participate in some way,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and they're still taking donations for the prizes.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   So it doesn't just have to be candy.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   These are things that maybe the children would like for prizes, and you wanna donate that.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   There are places where you can donate on the other side in the cafe area.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   So they're asking for more of that before that day.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And then we have, again, one last thing, the BAM Park Day Fellowship happening in November 5th.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So just kinda keep that in mind, okay?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   All right, so again, if you are joining us and you're new to the church,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   we have a offering box in the back for physical offerings.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   So whether it's a check or whatever it is, please visit that as you're going out.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   But for the rest of us, if you're gonna give electronically, let me pray for us,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   and then we'll give you a minute to get to that, all right?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Let's pray.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to come and worship you.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I pray that whatever distractions that we've been entangled with this week
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   help us to lift up our eyes to Christ,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   knowing, Father God, that that is where we find our refuge, our comfort, our hope.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I pray that you will strengthen the church, Lord God.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Remind us again and again and again of the hope that we have in him
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   so that all that we do, Father God, will be for the sake of your glory and for your kingdom.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I pray that even this giving, help us to give in a way that honors you as an act of worship,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   not under compulsion, but in joy, that it may be multiplied for your glory and for your use.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Let's put our hands together.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, Lord we come.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We're gathered together to lift up your name, to call on our Savior, to fall on your grace.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Hear the joyful sound of our offering, as your saints bow down, as your people sing.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   We will rise with you, lifted on your wings, and the world will sing that our God sings.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Our God sings, there is hope in your name, Lord.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   One more time, in the name.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Spirit, Lord we come.

[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And morning turns to songs of praise.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Our God sings, our God sings.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Hear the joyful sound of our offering, as your saints bow down,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   as your people sing.

[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Our God sings, there is hope in your name.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And morning turns to songs of praise.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Our God sings, our God sings.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Amen.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   [MUSIC - "I LOVE YOU"]
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Now I love the voice of Jesus on the cross of Calvary.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   He declares his work is finished.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   He has spoken this hope to me.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Though the sun has ceased its shining, though the war appears at last,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Christ had triumphed over evil.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Now the curse.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Now the curse, it has been broken.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Jesus paid the price for me.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   All the pardon he has offered, great the welcome that I receive.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Boldly I approach my Father, called in Jesus' righteousness.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   There is no more bill to carry.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   [MUSIC - "DEATH WAS ONCE MY GREAT OPPONENT"]
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Death was once.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Death was once my great opponent.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   But the Son who died to save us, wrote that we would be free indeed.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Death was once.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Death was once my great opponent.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   But the Son who died to save us, wrote that we would be free indeed.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yes, he wrote that we would be free indeed.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Free from every plan of darkness.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Free to live and free to die.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Death is dead and Christ is risen.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Onward to eternal glory.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   To my Savior and my God, I rejoice in Jesus' victory.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It was finished upon that cross.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And you may be seated.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   All right.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   This morning, we have a special presentation of our children.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   We -- our church has been very fruitful in multiplying.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   This is the fastest growing age of our church, zero to one.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yeah, so we're going to have the parents come, and one by one, they're going to be presenting their children.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So if we can -- are we going to call them one by one, or -- yeah, can we have everybody just come?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Let's welcome all the parents.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   [Applause]
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Okay.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So some of them are in the thick of things.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   You can tell by the bloodshot eyes.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Some of them are starting to come out of it.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And so they're going to all come up, and they're going to present their children.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And, again, we want to -- before they begin, I wanted to give a short encouragement.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I want to read a text from Psalm 127.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   It says, "Behold, children are a gift of the Lord.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   The fruit of the womb is a reward.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They will not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   [Baby crying]
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   So it's interesting in this text where children are described as quiver, they're basically arrows.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   You know, it's interesting that children are described as warriors in our generation.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   And the Bible describes, like, the many children that you have, how blessed you are
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   because we're able to raise up warriors for the next generation.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And so, again, we live in a generation where, you know, less and less there's, you know,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   population decrease in certain cultures because they see children as a burden.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   But, again, that should not be the case with Christians, that every child that is born into this world
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   is an opportunity for them to be equipped and trained to do the Lord's work
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and bring glory to God and be the light in this world.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So we're going to give an opportunity for all the parents to present their children.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Okay?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Hi, church family. My name is Jeremiah. This is my wife, Carrie.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   These are our babies, Karis and Seth.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So a little bit about them.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   They were actually brought into our family through adoption.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   We adopted them five days post-fertilization, so they were actually created by another couple through IVF.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And they were frozen for ten years before we transferred them.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   So they're technically 11 years old, but as you can see, developmentally, they're about five months now.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   So Karis means grace, and we named her just a reminder that the fact that she's here, alive,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and providentially God has brought her into our family is of grace.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   We just pray that she would receive saving grace and that she would remember God.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   God is a God of grace and has sovereignly orchestrated all things.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And then Seth, we named him.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   We were introduced to Seth in Genesis 4 after Cain kills Abel.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   God gives Adam and Eve another offspring, and Eve says that he has appointed another one in place of Abel for Cain killed Abel.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And we see that it was Seth's descendants that called upon the name of the Lord
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and ultimately received the Messiah from the line of Seth.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And so in a similar way, we were thinking that, you know, although Seth doesn't share genetic relationships with us,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   but God has sovereignly brought him into our family, and we pray that he would bless Seth and his descendants with godly individuals
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   and just bless the world and have a multi-generational impact for his glory.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   [applause]
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Good morning, church family.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   This is my wife Sharon, and this is our third Ayla.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And we chose her name because it starts with the letter A, and our other two also.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And we like the name.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Our other two starts with A, too.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And our prayer for all of our kids would be like they would come to Saving Faith at an early age.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And out of our three kids, she seems to be the most strong-willed.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And so we are praying that God will continue to grow her and use her to be bold in her faith and full of conviction and not easily swayed.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   And our prayer for her comes from Colossians 110, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   bearing fruits in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And so pray for our family that we would be able to create an environment at home that does not hinder the gospel from Ayla,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and that we would be able to continually preach the word to her and live it out in our daily lives.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   So thank you.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   [applause]
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Hi, I'm Jeremy, and this is my wife, Sarah, and this is our daughter, Coraline,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   which means something related to the heart or a maiden.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   But we didn't choose her name based on what it means but what it doesn't mean to us.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I'm a teacher. My wife used to be a teacher.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   We taught thousands of kids, and certain names have certain connotations.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   So we tried to not pick a name that has any sort of negative connotation.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So think of it, Coraline, we hadn't had any, so blank slate.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   But we do pray that she would come to faith, that God would give a heart of repentance,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   eyes of faith, so that she would be a blessing to others, including us.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   So thank you.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   [applause]
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Hi, everyone. My name is Joseph. This is my wife, Jessica, and this is our son, Benjamin.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   He's nine months old now, and the name Benjamin in Hebrew means "son of my right hand."
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   But we mostly just like the way the name sounded, and we usually call him Ben, which just means "son."
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Our prayer request for him will be that he comes to know Christ early on
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   and that he'll grow up to be a man who loves God.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And for us as parents, that we'll have patience and wisdom when raising him.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   [applause]
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Hi, good morning. My name is Herman. This is my wife, Jennifer.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And Aria, who's asleep on my shoulder.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Her name, we just really like the name Aria, so there's not a real story behind that.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But our prayer request for her is that she would grow up to love God and accept Christ as her Savior,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and that you would pray for us to have wisdom and be examples for her.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   [applause]
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Hi, everyone. My name's Davey, and this is my wife, Jenny.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   As you guys can see, our son has stage fright.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   His name is Jonathan, and we named him after the character in the Bible,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   as well as the meaning of the name.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It's also "gift from God," so he's definitely a gift from God.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   His middle name is Leo, it means "lion,"
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and we want him to have a heart of a lion, to be brave, to preach the gospel, and to follow Christ.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And also, our prayer request is for him to get to know Christ at a young age,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   as well as to have a good, loving relationship with his brother.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Yeah, that's it. Thank you.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   [applause]
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   All right, before we dismiss them, we're going to take a minute to pray for them.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And our prayer, again, is for all the parents,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   that they would come to faith at an early age,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   that each one of them will become warriors for the kingdom of God.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Let's pray.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the fruitfulness of our young families.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   We pray, Father God, that as each of the fathers have shared their desire and their prayer
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   for their children, Lord God, to open their ears and soften their hearts,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   that they may understand your grace and your love, your forgiveness, Lord God, upon their life.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   That they would truly be able to live long lives, Lord God, proclaiming the kingdom
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   and your love, Lord God, to this dark world.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Lord, I pray for protection for them.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   I pray that you would help us to build a community where we can share our love for you,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   for one another, that we would become brighter and brighter lights, Lord God.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Help us as adults and parents to build a church, Lord God, that our next generation of souls
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   will be able to take the baton and continue the work, Lord God, of spreading the gospel
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and being greater and greater light, especially as the world is becoming darker, Lord God.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Give them strength from an early age, that they would be able to support one another,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   encourage each other, and sharpen one another toward loving good deeds.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   So we lift these families and these children to you.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   All right, let's give them one more round of applause.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   [applause]
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   All right, so as they are being dismissed, if you can turn your Bibles to Luke 3,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and we will be reading from verse 23 all the way to verse 38.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And yes, we will be reading the genealogy.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Okay?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Okay, so if I pronounce it wrong, just keep it to yourself.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Okay?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I've already practiced with first service, but I do want to read them,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   even though we're not going to go through the names one by one.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It is in the Scripture, and there is nothing in the Bible that we shouldn't pay attention to.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So even if we're not going to be studying name by name, I think it is important for us,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   at least in principle, to know that these names are here for a reason.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Okay?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Luke 3, verse 23.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   "When he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about thirty years of age,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and he was the son of the son of Eli, the son of Methot, the son of Levi,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   the son of Melchi, the son of Jani, the son of Joseph, the son of Mattathias,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Hesli, the son of Nagai,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   the son of Mattathias, the son of Samin, the son of Joseph, the son of Jodah,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   the son of Joannon, the son of Rishah, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shertiel,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   the son of Neri, the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cossam,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   the son of Elmodam, the son of Ur, the son of Joshua, the son of Eleazar,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   the son of Jorim, the son of Methot, the son of Levi, the son of Simeon,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   the son of Melia, the son of Menna, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   the son of David, the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   the son of Nashon, the son of Ammedad, the son of Admin, the son of Ram,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   the son of Hazron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, the son of Jacob,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nehor,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   the son of Saruq, the son of Rehu, the son of Peleg, the son of Heber,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   the son of Shelah, the son of Canaan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Canaan, the son of Enosh,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. Let's pray.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing. We pray for the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   May your intentions of why these words are here, Father God,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   strike us, invite us, guide us, and build us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   As you guys know, right now we're kind of in election season,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   and so you've probably been getting a lot of advertisements or push to vote for this candidate or that candidate.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Typically, when you see the candidates being presented, if you've watched any debates,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   they usually start out by giving their credentials. And they'll say,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   "You should vote for me because I have this background. I went to this school.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   These are the experiences." Or if they've been in office, they'll say, "These are my accomplishments."
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And the reason why they do that is obvious. It's because they're selling themselves
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   so that you can vote for them, that they will be the best leader.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   And obviously, a lot of that is fluff because they're trying to sell themselves.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   But they do that in order for you to understand who they are.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   So if they do get elected, you know what their credentials are,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   so that you would pay attention to them and possibly follow their leadership.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Luke has been preparing for the presentation of Christ from chapter 1.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Obviously, all the Gospels is a detailed presentation of who Jesus is.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Up to this point, we've been learning the background about who Christ is
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   and how John the Baptist showed up on the scene and what he did for the preparation of Christ.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And so we looked at, first of all, a couple of weeks ago, not only John the Baptist's ministry,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   but his confirmation. In his baptism, he rises up and heavens open up,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and God the Father speaks, and the Holy Spirit descends.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And there's a confirmation of the Trinity, where he said, "You are my Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And the Holy Spirit rests upon him. And again, a confirmation for anybody who is questioning,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "Who is this man? How is he any different than anybody else who has been baptized?"
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And so clearly, it's a presentation of who he is.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Next week, we're going to be looking at the temptation of Christ.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   So the temptation of Christ is, again, a confirmation before he enters into ministry of redemption,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   that people understand that he is worthy to take away our sins.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   That every part of this test is to confirm that he is capable and able to stand in the way
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   where he can take away our sins. And that's why he needs to be tested to see if he truly can be the Messiah,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   if he truly is perfect without sin. And so that's the confirmation that we're going to see next week.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Today, the confirmation is in his genealogy, that he is the fulfillment of the prophecy given,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   not only to David and Abraham, but all the way back to the time of Adam.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   In the Bible, as you know, there are two separate genealogies of Christ.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   We have one in the book of Matthew, and then we have one here.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   The one in the book of Matthew is very particular in that it is written to the Jews
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   so that they would recognize that he is the fulfillment of the prophecy given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   and then to David, that he is the Messiah that they've been waiting for.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   So in order to establish that, Matthew, as the whole theme of the book, is that Jesus as king,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   his genealogy is written starting from Abraham in a descending manner all the way to Christ.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   There's about 42 of them that are mentioned.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Luke's gospel, the emphasis is not the Jewish community. The emphasis is to mankind.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And so for that reason, the connection goes all the way in an ascending order,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   starting from Jesus all the way to Adam, and there are 77 different people who are mentioned here.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Now you have to understand that genealogies are extraordinarily important to the Jewish community.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   In fact, the Bible has over 34 different genealogies, depending on how you count it.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Some will say 27, some will say 34, depending on how you count these genealogies.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   So our natural tendency is when we see genealogy, it's like a, you know, they call it fan reading.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Turn on the fan and let the pages flip and say, "I did it. I saw it."
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   But we don't really spend a lot of time digging through what the purpose of this genealogy is.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   They did not randomly write these things. These are here for a particular reason.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   In fact, sometimes the parts of the Bible that we don't normally preach on,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   there's so much more treasure that are buried in there because we don't pay much attention to it.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   But these are here for a reason.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   In a Jewish community in particular, genealogies were very important because it fulfilled two purposes.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And one main one, the reason why it was important, is because he said that the seed of the woman
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   is going to come basically save the world.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And so from the get-go, they took meticulous order of their genealogy.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Now, in our generation, like how many of you know your genealogy beyond your great-grandparents?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Right? If you know that, right?
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And because so many of us immigrated or our parents immigrated,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   we don't know a whole lot beyond our grandparents or great-grandparents, right?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   But even if that wasn't the case, most people don't know beyond maybe the second or third generation up,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   if you know that.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   But very few will know 400, 500, 600 years of our ancestral background, right?
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Every once in a while, you'll take one of those genetic tests and say you have 2% Irish, 4% Chinese,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   5% Japanese, or whatever it is that you have.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   But it's more out of curiosity. Not necessarily it has any effect.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   So you find out that you have some Western or European blood.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   It's just interesting, and that's it.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Well, the Jews took meticulous genealogical record,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   one, because God told them that this was going to happen.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   But secondly, if you read the Book of Numbers, their inheritance was based upon their genealogy.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   So if you can trace your genealogy back to the tribe of Judah, you got a larger piece of land.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   So if there was any kind of land dispute, they would have to go back into their genealogy and say,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   "I am deserving of this because I can prove to you that I'm from the tribe of Benjamin or tribe of Judah."
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Or if you're from tribe of Simeon, you might have got a little piece of land, right?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And so for that reason, for personal reasons, they took meticulous record of the genealogy.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   So it's not like us.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   We know, just out of curiosity, I wonder what my grandparents were like.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And I asked before my father passed away, like, "Where did Christianity come into our family?"
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And found out that it was my mother, my grandmother's mother, who were the first ones that received Christ.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   But outside of that, I know very little.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   But the Jewish community knew meticulously where they came from, 500, 600, 700, who married who, what happened,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   what kind of problems did they have, what kind of blessing, what land they owned.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Because all of this was record of their inheritance.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And secondly, it was a record of their spiritual inheritance,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   like the promise that God made that this was how the covenant was coming by.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   The reason why this is so important was when Matthew and Luke presents the genealogy,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   if anybody wanted to contest it, they could have easily contested it.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   If I told you this morning that I am a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, right,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   you can easily prove me wrong, right, because my birth records are somewhere else, right?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   And you can easily look at, you know, just even looking at me, right?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   If I told you that I came from Europe, you could tell, right?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Well, in the first century, before the destruction of the temple,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   if somebody presented themselves and said, "I'm a direct descendant of David,"
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   or began to say, "I give false genealogy,"
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   they were so meticulous about keeping genealogy of every Jew,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   and it was kept at the temple, they could have easily taken this and said, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   They could have easily gone to the temple and said, "There's no way.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Jesus says that's not his father, that's not his mother, that's not his grandfather."
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   They could have easily dismissed that.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So the fact that these two genealogies are written for people who could have easily dismissed it
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   is, again, proof to us that all of these things are true.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Because if it wasn't, they could have easily been debunked.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   What's interesting is that after Christ comes,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   after all the purposes of why these genealogies were kept was fulfilled in Christ,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   the temple was destroyed at AD 70.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And as a result of that, all the genealogical records has been erased since AD 70.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So today, if you meet a modern-day Jew, and they tell you they're from a tribe of Judah,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   it's just by family tradition. There's no way to prove it.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   If they say they're from the tribe of Judah, because there's no legal record that traces them back further than AD 70,
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   they wouldn't have any record of it.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   It's just they were told this from their grandparents and great-grandparents.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So the fact that these were presented to that generation in and of itself is evidence of its accuracy.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   The genealogies, although it became obsolete when Christ came to fulfill it,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   we want to look at what's happening in this genealogical record.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And there's something very different than the book of Matthew, because I don't know,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   some of you guys may remember when we were going through Matthew,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   there's actually quite a few names that we can point to and then flip to the Old Testament
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   and find their story in the Old Testament.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Three-fourths of the names that are mentioned in the Gospel of Luke are nowhere to be found in the Bible.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   You'll recognize, as I was reading it, you probably recognize maybe about half a dozen names,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   whether it's Noah and his children or in the beginning or Adam or Seth.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   But three-fourths of the people that are mentioned here out of the 77, there's no trace of them.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   And their names may be mentioned, but there's no record of who they are, so we don't know anything about them.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   So this morning, my intention is not to go back and dig through the history and find extra biblical evidence,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   because we don't have any.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   It's really for us to have a broad understanding as to why is this here?
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Why was this necessary?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Obviously, one is to prove that Christ fulfilled the promise that was made in the beginning.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   But secondly, it is a record of God's faithfulness to all of us.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And so what I want to do this morning is I want to, I'm not going to dig into each part of this text,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   but I want to give a large overview of why this is important.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Genesis chapter 315, right?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   There's a reason why Luke's genealogy goes all the way back up to Adam,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   because Jesus is not just the fulfillment of the prophecy to the nation of Israel, but to mankind.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   In Genesis 315, where the theologians call this the pre-gospel,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   that there's traces of what God has intended that he was going to do to mankind right after the fall,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   and he says this, "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And he shall bruise you on the head, and you shall bruise him on the heel."
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   In that text alone, obviously, we don't know the gospel, right?
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   But when you start to trace the history of what he says and how this is fulfilled,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   clearly you can trace it back and say he had this intention from the beginning, right?
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   And so the promise was that because of their failure, sin and death had come to reign.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   But God makes a promise that he's going to restore them through the seed of the woman.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   So you would think that after this promise is made, that we get to chapter 4,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   and then when they have their first seed, that this curse would be reversed, right?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   That's what you would expect. If you read this understanding that that's what he meant,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   you would expect something completely different in chapter 4. But what happens in chapter 4?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   They have another child, and what does that child turn out to be?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   A murderer.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   So the first seed, the first seed that comes out of Eve after the fall is another murderer.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And who does he murder? His own brother because he's jealous.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   And so you would think, "Okay, well maybe it's not this generation. Maybe it's the next one."
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   So we skip down to chapter 6, and the numbers of the descendants begin to multiply.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   So there's many seeds that have been multiplied, and then we get to chapter 6,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   and the more they multiply, the more they sinned.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And so God is so grieved over all the seeds of her children that he ends up deciding to wipe them all out,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   with the exception of Noah and his family.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   So Adam then gets spared, and he's going to basically repopulate the earth
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   because all the seeds have been corrupt.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   So you would think, "Okay, they started over, so Noah and his family repopulate, and everything's going well."
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Except by the time we get to chapter 11, when they repopulate, what happens?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   They become more advanced. They're one together, and they're greater in number.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   They have more money, and they use that to do what in chapter 11?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   They decide to build the Tower of Babel, and they're going to challenge God like Satan did.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   And as a result of that, God has to judge them, and he destroys the Tower of Babel, and he confuses the language.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Imagine, like today in our generation, how much talk about becoming one, being united, we have to be one.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   But we have a clear record when sinful people gather together, they sin even greater.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Unity in and of itself is not a blessing from God, because that's what man does in chapter 11.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   But despite that, God breaks in in Genesis chapter 12, and he says, "Despite the sins of mankind,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   I'm going to raise up your descendants.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Your descendants are going to outnumber the stars in the sand, and I'm going to give you land,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   and because of you, all the other natures are going to be multiplied."
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   So from chapter 12 to chapter 50 is a story of the line of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   So you would think now that God has confirmed and specified how he was going to bless and save mankind,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   you would think that the story would start to flourish from this point on.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   Instead, you have chapter 12 to 50 of an entanglement of sin, of infighting,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   of brothers wanting to kill each other back and forth.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   And then at the end of Genesis, instead of ending in hope, there's more despair.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   At the beginning of the book of Exodus, they basically get enslaved.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Before they become an official nation, they're enslaved for 400 years.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   400 years. This is after God made the promise that the seed of the woman is going to come crush the head of the Satan.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And then for 400 years, after God told Abraham that your descendants are going to be a blessing to all the world,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   they become slaves. And as a result of becoming slaves, they cry out to God.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   God has mercy on them, and God delivers them miraculously from the greatest superpower, human power, at that time.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   And so you would think that after they come out, they say they finally learned their lesson.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   The nation of Israel is established, and then we see the book of Leviticus.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Those of you who are with us in the book of Leviticus, if you carefully study the book of Leviticus,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   is that a very welcoming book? No. Everything about the tabernacle does not say welcome.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   If you read it, it says, "If you do this, you will die. If you do that, you will die.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   If you touch this, you will die. If you eat this, you will die. If you stand here, you will die.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   If you offer up a string fire, you will die. If you come too far, you will die.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   If the animal is defected, you will die." It says over and over again, it is not very welcoming.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   In fact, the book of Leviticus is telling sinful people, "Do not be arrogant to think that you can possibly come into my presence."
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   After he gives the instructions and warning, the very first offering that is given is rejected.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   And just as he said, "Nehudah ben Abihu" dies, just as he said.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   So imagine the fear that came upon the nation of Israel as a result of the tabernacle.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   It wasn't like, "Oh, our God is there. I want to go see him today.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   I'm so lonely. Can I come and abide in his tabernacle?"
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   No. The presence of the tabernacle was terrifying.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Leviticus is a reminder to them to take God's presence seriously.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And then we get into the book of Numbers.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   That as God is leading them into the promised land, that the spies who went and saw it, they wouldn't believe.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Even after all that they have experienced with God, they go and see these fortified cities.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Like, "These guys are giants. We can't beat them."
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   And as a result of their unbelief, they wander in the desert for 40 years.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   And that's the book of Numbers.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   And you would think that during the 40 years that they would be faithful servants,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   but there's infighting, idolatry, every sin that you can imagine happens,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   even as they are wandering in the desert for 40 years.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   And then right before they get in, God has an assembly.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   And he tells them in the book of Deuteronomy, "I'm going to take you into the promised land, like I said.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   And I'm going to finally fulfill the promise of land that I said to Abraham.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   But when you get in there, if you obey my law, you will be blessed. And here is the blessing."
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   And then he says, "But if you do not obey my commandments, here is the curses."
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   And there's three times more descriptions of the curses than the blessing.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   It's almost like God already knew what was going to happen.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Sure enough, we get into the book of Joshua.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   And Joshua, this young servant, comes in strong general.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   And God uses him to conquer and enter into the promised land.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   And so in the book of Joshua, the first few chapters,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   most of you have probably memorized Joshua chapter 1, verse 8, verse 9.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   "Have I not commanded you, 'Be strong and courageous, do not turn from the Lord to the left or to the right.'"
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Because all the excitement happens at chapter 1.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   But as soon as they get into the promised land, what happens?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   As soon as they enter, they break God's law.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   And they start falling into sin.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   So the rest of the book of Joshua is the compromise of the nation of Israel after they conquer and they go in.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   So they finally go in, and then we get into the book of Judges.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   And the theme of the book of Judges is that everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   They will continue to fall into sin in the promised land.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   And as a result of that, the enemies will come.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   They conquer them. God has mercy on them.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   And raises up a judge and delivers them for a period.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   But as soon as they become comfortable, they forget God.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   They turn to their sin.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   The enemies come back.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   And then they cry out to God, and God has mercy.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   So this cycle of this over and over and over and over of their rebellion against God in the book of Judges.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Now, by this time, you would think, okay, they're done.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   They have to be done.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years that they've been rebelling one generation after another generation.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Right in the midst of all of that, right, after the curse of God is being added upon them generation after generation after generation,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   we see a strange book, a book of Ruth.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   And God breaks into their rebellious history, and this strange girl out of nowhere, who's not even a Jew,
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   is faithful to the mother-in-law, and they introduce to us a figure named Boaz, a kinsman redeemer,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   who is a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   And reminding us that even in the midst of this darkness, that God has not forgotten his covenant.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   And that's the book of Ruth.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Then we get into 1 Samuel, 1 Kings, and 1 Chronicles, which is the establishment of the kings until the end.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Now, you know, there was an earlier part of the church years ago, I was preaching through this section of the Bible.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   By the time I was about a third way through, I was finished.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   And the reason why I was, and some of you, there's probably only like maybe four or five of you who was with us during that time.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Because every single Sunday, I would come and say, "Well, this king did this, and because of their sin, God judged them this way.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   And so we need to make sure that we live righteously."
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   And then the next week I would come, "Well, this king started out well, but they fell.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   And then God judged them, and as a result of that, that they need to repent, and God did this, so we need to be careful."
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   The next week I would come, "But then this king, they come, and they seem to be okay, but eventually they fall out."
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   So basically, it was months and months and months of how every single king rebelled against God and led them astray.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   So by the time I was about halfway through, I said, "I see why there's no material in the Old Testament."
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   You know what I mean? In the New Testament, any passage I want to look up, I can find dozens and dozens of sermon on any text, any word.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   But if you go back into the Old Testament and look for expository preaching in the Old Testament, it doesn't exist.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   So either they would make a broad stroke, there's one sermon in the Book of Judges, two sermons in Kings, or three sermons, or a topical sermon on this particular.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   But it's very, very difficult to find expositional teaching, preaching from king to king to king to king.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   I started it, so I had to finish it, you know, and I felt darkness coming over me, you know what I mean?
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   And I said, "Oh my gosh, I got to do this again." And I would see on the people's faces, like just darkness.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   And I literally would dread, after the king is over, I got another king, and another king, and another king.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   And I was eager to get out of the kings and the chronicles.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   In the midst of that, I was like, "Finally, we get through." And to be honest, I stopped at Psalms.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I went through Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, and parts of Job.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   I was so depressed, like I was so eager to jump to the Book of Matthew, you know?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Ezra and Nehemiah that comes after 1st and 2nd Chronicles, basically it's, they don't heed the warnings of the prophets,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   and they get taken away into captivity, and God has mercy and raises up a king, Cyrus, and they're able to return.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   But when they returned, it wasn't a glorious return.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   Majority of them got comfortable where they were at, and only a fraction of the Jews remember the covenant that God made,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   and came back to Jerusalem. Why would we need to go to Jerusalem when our life is fine over here?
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Some of them had become officials, some of them became wealthy, but they leave that behind to go back where?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   To go back to what's there, other than God's covenant promise.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   So very few of them returned.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   So when they built a temple, you had the old people who remember the glory that they fell from,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   and in their celebration, they would be weeping because it was, it was, it was so, it was so tiny.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   It was, the glory did not match what they remembered, and then the young ones, that's all they knew,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   they're like, that's awesome!
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   And so even as they are rebuilding, it's a reminder of their constant sin.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   And then again, Esther breaks in.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   In the midst of all of this, God gives us hope that through this one person,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   that it just seems like a random story, but again, it's a foreshadow reminding us that a Savior is going to come,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   that despite the darkness of their history, God is going to come.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   Then we have the book of Job. We don't know exactly where Job fits in,
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   but the theme of the book of Job is basically no matter how righteous you are,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   if you're living in this fallen earth, you will experience suffering.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   And the answer to that suffering is God.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   That's pretty much the theme of the book of Job,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   which is the condition of every human being.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   And then we get to the book of Psalm.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   You know, most people don't know this about the book of Psalm,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   because we pick and choose the Psalms that we like.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   Psalm 23, Psalm chapter 1, Psalm 119, and so the Psalms that uplift us, right?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Three-fourths of the Psalm is sinners complaining because of the suffering.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Why did the righteous suffer? Why did you allow this?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Where are you, O God? Where can I run?
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   So three-fourths of it is honest prayer before God in their suffering.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Read Psalm all the way through. It is not uplifting.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   You'll come out depressed.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   A lot to relate to,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   but it basically is a highlight of the suffering of all mankind.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   And then you get to the prophets.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   All the prophets are--falls into three categories.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   They're pre-exile, exile, and post-exile.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   So the pre-exile are prophets that God sends to the nation of Israel saying,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   "If you don't turn from your sin, your enemies are going to come and take you captive,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   and all your leaders, all your young men, all the women, all your children are going to be taken to captivity.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   You're going to lose your country."
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   And so they're warning them, and then they don't listen, and they go into exile.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   And then God sends prophets during the exile saying,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   "To turn from their sin, even after you've experienced all of that,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   you continue to go after idolatry? Didn't you learn your lesson?"
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   And then we get to post-exile, that after they return,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   it's like, "Did you not learn your lesson?"
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   So it's the prophets pleading with a rebellious nation to turn and return.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   "Did you not learn your lesson?"
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   It is a depressing thing to study.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   Because at the end of a careful systematic study from Genesis to the book of Malachi,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   it is the judgment of God that is repeatedly coming upon the nation of Israel
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   over and over and over and over again for thousands of years.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   But the only glimmer of hope in Israel's history is that every one of these prophets,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   after they pronounce judgment upon them, says, "Despite that, that God will remember His covenant,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   and your Messiah is going to come, and He's going to establish a kingdom that is everlasting,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   and He promises that this Messiah is going to come."
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   And then silence. Silence.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   For hundreds of years, no prophet, no voice.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   And just as God said to Amos, "There's going to be a famine of the Word that's going to come
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   because of your rebellion."
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   And then Jesus shows up.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   So this genealogical record is a history of God's faithfulness
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   through thousands of years of Israel's rebellion.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   And so this genealogy basically is the light being turned on.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   That He has finally come after all these years.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   The promise that God made in Genesis chapter 3, right after they fell,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   generation after generation after generation after generation after generation after generation,
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   God keeps His promise.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   And that is Christ.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   And that's who He is. That's being represented.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   At what point would you have turned to despair if you were a Jew?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   My guess is chapter 4.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   My guess is chapter 4.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   My guess is your seed's going to come, and then the seed comes,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   and murderer!
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   And your own brother!
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   I said, "Okay, okay. Maybe chapter 6? Maybe chapter 6?
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Chapter 11, maybe?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   Maybe chapter 12 you started, gets a second wind,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   and by the time you get to chapter 50, it's like, "Oh my gosh.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   These are the people that God's going to fulfill His promise?"
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   And then you get to the book of Exodus, it's like, "These slaves?"
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   And then they get delivered, it's like, "These are the people that God delivered?
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   And they're the ones that God's going to use?"
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   And then they get into the promise line, it's like, "Then? They're the promised people?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   They're the ones who are going to declare the glory of God?"
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   At what point would you have fallen into despair?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   How often do we fall into despair because God didn't answer our prayer today?
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   How often do we fall into despair because He didn't answer the way we wanted?
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   How often, how short-sighted are we because we measure His faithfulness
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   based upon this thin timeline that we've given Him?
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   See, this whole genealogy is a record of God's faithfulness
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   beyond what you and I can compare.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Last week I gave an illustration about the men stop poking.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   And I asked you guys, "What was the whole message about?"
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   Some of you guys forgot already, but you remember the poking.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   So I'm going to give you another illustration about dating.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   So that you can remember. Remember the rest of the message too, okay?
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   I give an encouragement to not to poke because the person that you're poking
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   is not tomato, it's not melon, right?
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   This is a person that's possibly the mother of your child.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   So make up your mind and commit, right? Commit.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   You know, early on in dating, that's a very fragile stage of your life
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   when you're dating because you're kind of checking each other's credit, basically.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   Can I trust him? Is he trustworthy?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   Am I able to invest in him?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   And so every time they act a certain way or they say something or they do something,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   you always go back to ask, "Is this worth investing?"
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   "Do you really care about me? Do you really love me? Is this going to work out?"
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   And so because you're in the beginning stages, there's no credit yet.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   There's no record of faithfulness yet.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   But the benefit of being married, especially being married for a long period of time,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   that you have years and years and years of a track record, right?
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   Assuming that there was faithfulness, years and years and years of track record
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   of proving that you care, proving that you love.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   So as a result of that, like Esther and I, we've been married for 30 years,
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   going on 31 years. We have 30-some years, you know, and we went through the same thing
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   in the early part of our dating life.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   It's like, is she the one, right?
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   If she doesn't answer my phone call on time, it's like, "Oh, maybe she doesn't care."
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   Or if I don't call her back, it's like, "Maybe he doesn't care."
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   But now that we've been together for 30-some years, there's a lot of peace, right?
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   Because we have good credit, right?
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   We have 850 and above credit score, right?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   It hasn't been perfect, but at least we have good credit, right?
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Now, again, obviously I'm saying all of this because no matter how great your credit is,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   no matter how tight your relationship is, it's based upon a few years.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   God's nature has been proven for thousands of years,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   not even through our faithfulness.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   In the midst of unfaithfulness of His people,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   He has been proven over and over and over and over again
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   that what God says, He does.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   What God says, He does.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Every single generation that is mentioned here,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   every single generation, there's not a single generation we can look at and say,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   "Well, at least here we can see why God would be faithful."
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Every single generation that is mentioned here,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   people are saying, "He should have quit here. He should have quit here. He should have quit here."
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   No one would blame Him if He forgot them here.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   No one would have blamed Him because every generation.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   Everyone says, "When you read the Old Testament superficially, people say,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   'Oh, God is so harsh in the Old Testament.'"
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   It's because you have not read it.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   You've only skimmed through it.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   When you study the Old Testament carefully, you will come out exactly the way I came out.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   How did God put up with these people for that long?
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   How did God—imagine the restraint.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   Imagine how easily we fall into despair when somebody disappoints us.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   Even for one, two, three.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   In fact, the older we get, the less trusting we are.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   Very rarely you see somebody who's untrusting when they're young,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   and they become very trusting when they get older.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   It's usually not.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   It's very difficult to excite older people.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   What I mean by older, you judge yourself.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   I'm not talking about 40-year-olds.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   But the older you get, it's more difficult because you've experienced life.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   You've experienced people. You've been disappointed.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   You've been disappointed in relationships with friends,
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   your husband, your wife, your children.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   The older we get, it's very difficult to get excited about anything.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   Whatever happens, you're like, "Yeah, we'll see.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   We'll see how long this lasts.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   We'll see if they're really going to be faithful.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   We'll see if this friendship really lasts. We'll see."
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   The reason that happens is because we experience disappointment
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   after disappointment after disappointment,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   and we harden our hearts because we don't want to be disappointed again.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   God has been walking with unfaithful people for thousands of years.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   For thousands of years.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   If there's anything that we can trust is His Word.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Because He has not reneged on any of His promises, not a single promise.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   And that's what Jesus says, "Not an iota will pass away until it is fulfilled."
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Not even an iota, not even the smallest of the letter that God has spoken
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   will pass away until it is fulfilled.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   This genealogy is a record of that promise
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   in the midst of all the rebellion, God remembered His covenant.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   In Ephesians 1 through 5, it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the places in Christ,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world."
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   He chose us. He didn't poke at us.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   He didn't test us. He made up His mind.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   And He chose us, and He committed to us.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   And as a result, He says that we would be holy and blameless before Him.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   In love He predestined us. He didn't just randomly select us.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   He says in love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   according to the kind intention of His will.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   Everything that you and I experience today as a child of God is intentional.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   It's intentional. That despite our failures, despite our weakness,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   I am more aware of the grace of God today than the first day that I started.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   Because I am more aware of His holiness, and I am more aware of my own sins.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   I have less confidence today in myself than I did when I first started.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   I know more today. I've experienced more today.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   I've done more today. I've borne more fruit today.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   But I have less confidence today.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   And I have less and less confidence every year.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   Because I am more and more aware of my flesh.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   Just how deep this sin goes.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   Just how deep this pride goes.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   Just how deep this coveting goes.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   Just how easily my heart wanders.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Just how easily my heart gets hearted.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   The way that I respond to slander.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   And I am more and more aware of how fragile my soul is without the grace of God.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   This genealogy reminds me.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   Every generation, He persevered.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Every generation, He persevered.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   And all of this is a reminder to us that this is Christ in us.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   This is Christ in us.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Sometimes we quit because we think that our sins are too deep.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   Sometimes we give up. Maybe not physically give up, but internally we give up.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   We stop trying because we don't want to get hurt.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   We don't want to be disappointed or oftentimes disappointed in ourselves.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   But this genealogy reminds us.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   That He demonstrates His own love toward us.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   While we were yet sinners, Christ dies for us.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   He didn't die for us because of our potential.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   He didn't die for us because we were diamond in the rough and He wanted to clean us up so He can shine our inner glory.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   He said while we were yet sinners.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   While we were rebelling.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   While we hated Him.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   Why?
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   Because that was the only way.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   That was the only way that sinners can come to a holy, holy, holy God.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   I want to remind us that the only reason why you and I are here in Malachi 3, 5 is for I the Lord do not change.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   Therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   I want you to really let that sink in.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   The reason why you and I are not consumed.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Why the fire of God does not fall from the sky today.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   Why are we not struck for our sins today?
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Think about it.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Think about if you were in God's position, how easily you get angered.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Somebody cuts you off in the freeway for no reason.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   Right? And because you are a good Christian, you are going to hold your wrath back?
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   How often have you thought, if I didn't meet the Lord in 1983, the wrath, this guy deserves wrath.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   Simply because he cut me off.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   Or somebody spoke to you a certain way.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   They didn't respect you.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   Imagine how easily we get triggered when we are wronged.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   Imagine the tremendous restraint of our God.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Imagine this tremendous restraint of our God.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   And he says, it is because he does not change, we are not consumed.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   Just that alone.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   The fact that you and I are able to be here and worship God, call him our Abba Father,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   to have eternal hope that we are not consumed simply because God said.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   Simply because God said.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   That alone.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Not because God answered our prayers, not because we have wealth, not because we are healthy.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   But simply because we are not consumed for our sins.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   We should come into this room every Sunday praising God for the breath in our lungs.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   I am going to cut to the chase and introduce next week for us.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   Okay?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   First service, I didn't get here.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   But I am going to skip a bunch of this stuff because I want us to be prepared for next week.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 22 it says, for as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   And in Romans 5, 14 it says, nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   He reigned.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   Even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is the type of him who was to come.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   There is a reason why the genealogy goes way up to Adam.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   And it is in ascending order where Jesus is connected all the way to Adam.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   There is a reason. Because the Bible says the first Adam came and sin came in.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   And as a result of that sin, the record of this genealogy in history is a record of the damage of sin in mankind.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   That is the genealogical record. That is the Old Testament.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   And then what happens?
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Jesus comes in.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   In that genealogy, in the midst of this curse, Jesus comes to absorb this curse upon himself.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   He who knew no sin became sin so that you and I would become the righteousness of God.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   So all of this is to introduce Jesus as the consumer of our curse.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   The way he dealt with their curse is to take it upon himself.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   If you believe this, even like a mustard seed, how can that not change you?
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   Even if you don't have the greatest of faith, even if you have a tiny little mustard seed of a faith,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   but you believe that the God of the universe who created us, who should have consumed us thousands of years ago,
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   and not even then, even in our lives, even after we became a Christian,
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   all the sins that you and I have deliberately committed,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   and yet he consumed all of that upon himself.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   That if you believe even a mustard seed of that, how can that not humble us?
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   How can that not change us?
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   How can that not consume us?
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   That every Sunday we come and worship this God who forgave my sins, past, present, and future.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   This is a God worth worshiping.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   This is a God worth following.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   This is a God worth giving everything that we have.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   I pray that the next time you read these genealogies, that you and I would remember the love of God.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   And every one of these names would scream out, "I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you."
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   Let's pray.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   As our praise team comes to lead us in worship, let's take some time to cry out to our Lord.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   Have you known him from a distance?
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Do you only know him from other people's testimonies?
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   To come to the Lord and confess your sins.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   Ask for his forgiveness.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   He says he will be faithful and just to forgive us of all our unrighteousness.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   Don't be satisfied by watching the author of life from a distance.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   Come. Come to him.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   All who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   And he will give you rest.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   The only true rest.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   He's the living water.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   He's the bread of life.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   So I invite you now to come.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Invite him.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Take some time to pray that God would soften our hearts and renew our devotion to him.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.

[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   Psalm 139, 13 to 16.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   For you form my inward parts, you wove me in my mother's womb.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   I will give thanks to you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   Wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in secret.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth, your eyes have seen my unformed substance.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   And in your book were all written the days that were ordained for me,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   when as yet there was not one of them.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   Lord, we pray that your faithfulness throughout history,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   and your faithfulness, Lord, in our lives,
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:06.000]   would cause us to firmly plant all our hope and joy and life in Christ and Christ alone.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be people who shine the light of Christ,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   that in this dark world, as the wickedness increases and the love of many grow cold,
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   help us, Lord God, to be passionately in love with Jesus.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   That everything that we do will be an overflow of the tremendous grace that you have given us.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be humbled.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be grateful.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   Help us to be worshippers, that we may worship you in spirit and in truth wherever you send us.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   He lived and died to buy my poverty.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior there.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:10.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]   Amen.
