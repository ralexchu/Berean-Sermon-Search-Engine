[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (children cheering)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   - So,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.800]   cats, fork and spork were able to share the bottle
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.280]   with coughing and wheezing.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.720]   They traveled again to continue God's great commission
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.400]   to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.560]   (children chattering)
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.200]   - Are we lost?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.280]   - We're not lost.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.520]   - This looks like a moon.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.920]   - But we're not lost.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.160]   I know exactly where we are and we're not lost.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.600]   - Hey, look at us, that means we're directions.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.020]   - We're not lost.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.160]   - Can you tell us how to get to Mars?
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.240]   We need directions.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.480]   (chomping)
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.560]   We're trying to get to Mars.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.640]   Can you help us?
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.280]   (chomping)
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.400]   - I'm Cork and this is Spork.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.280]   Can you tell us where Mars is?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640]   (chomping)
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.840]   - You already said that.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080]   (chomping)
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.440]   - Let's just go this way.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.280]   - Okay, fine.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.040]   (chomping)
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360]   (dramatic music)
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.960]   (cheering)
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.200]   - Hey, I never wanted to know who I am
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.480]   if my computer was this size.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.840]   Those four, they're only gonna fall
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   through my trap once again.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.440]   - Hey, let's go stop Annie.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.280]   - Okay.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120]   - Shh.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.480]   - Wow, she's so pretty.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.160]   - I know, like look right there.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.920]   - Wow, and she even has earrings.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.600]   (laughing)
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   And does she have a mustache?
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   She kind of has a manly face.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.320]   (laughing)
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.640]   She's so pretty.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.840]   Anyway, can you give us the directions to Mars?
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.600]   - Of course I can give you directions to Mars.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   Come here, this way, this way, this way.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   This way, this way, here, let me show you.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.880]   All you have to do is come right here and--
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   (screaming)
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.960]   - I can't believe they fell through my pipe once again,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.120]   you fools.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.440]   I mean, I can't blame you though.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.880]   I am pretty gorgeous.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.800]   You fools, you better wait.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.240]   I'm gonna come back and get you and do evil things.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.800]   - What happened?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.440]   - I think I hit the computer.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.880]   - Oh no, we can't get out.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   How are we gonna get out of this theater?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.720]   - Don't worry, we'll find a way out somehow.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.000]   How, somehow?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.440]   - Why did this have to happen to us?
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.280]   Why us?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   Hey!
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.240]   - Don't worry, God has a plan for us
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.800]   and we just need to trust in him.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.000]   - You're right, we need to trust in God.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.160]   What should we do?
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.480]   - I'm going to pray.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.120]   God, please help us to remember
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.800]   that you have a plan for us and that you love us.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.280]   Thank you for sending your son to save us.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   - Amen.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.080]   - I am cursed.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.920]   - What?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.760]   - What?
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.600]   - What?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.680]   - I'm cursed.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.880]   - Whoa, we're out.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.720]   - Yeah.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.800]   - I'm cursed.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.640]   - Yeah.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.480]   - Help me with that.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   - Quick, let's get back to the ship
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.560]   before Nemesis finds us.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.960]   - Okay, let's go.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.280]   - Oh look, there's a message on the screen.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.320]   We should play it.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.760]   (computer beeps)
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.080]   - Captain, entering message.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920]   - Captain.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.440]   - Captain Quint and Quint, we are on mission right now
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400]   in China, and our people are in extreme danger.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.560]   We need you to continue to work for the Great Commission.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.880]   Come back to China, that people need you.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.800]   And we hope that everyone, all the audience
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.160]   will join us in the work of the Great Commission.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   It's up to you.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:38.240]   - Hey, where did they go?
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.520]   Did you guys have anything to do with that?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.360]   (audience cheers)
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   Quint and Squirtle, where are they?
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.400]   Hey, you three, did you have anything to do with this?
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.680]   Drama.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   No, okay, Groots, my name is Nemesis of Genesis,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.600]   not like my twin brother Andrew over there, but,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Groots, I'm asking you, where is Captain Quint and Squirtle?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.480]   (audience cheers)
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   I am getting so sick and tired of this Groot.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.640]   I am going to beat you up.
