[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to John chapter 12 verses 12 through verse 19.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Okay.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.440]   We're going to start us off on the Passion Week and what happened on Sunday.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   John chapter 12 verses 12 through 19.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.680]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.780]   Jerusalem.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.320]   So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, "Hosanna, blessed
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.880]   is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel."
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.520]   And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, "Fear not, daughter
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   of Zion.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.720]   Behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt."
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.200]   The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.480]   the dead continued to bear witness.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.280]   The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard what he had done, that
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.600]   he had done this sign.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.200]   So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are gaining nothing.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.760]   Look, the world has gone after him."
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.600]   Let's pray.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   Heavenly Father, we come before you this afternoon asking for your blessing upon this time.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.380]   As we remember Palm Sunday and what may have been going through his mind and what was happening
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.320]   in the crowd, and just to prepare us for this week, I pray, Lord God, that you give us soft
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420]   hearts as you are the potter and we are the clay.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.000]   We desire to be molded according to your purpose.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.560]   We ask, Lord God, that our time of celebration and remembering would have its effect that
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   you've intended.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.760]   And so we deliver this time to you.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.080]   I'm going to ask you a question this morning.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   Again, it's a question I'm not asking you to say it out loud.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.860]   Just think to yourself, what is the prayer request or prayer that you've been offering
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.480]   up to God in the last couple of months?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.320]   Okay, don't say it out loud.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   Just think to yourself.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.880]   Okay, what was that one thing?
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.520]   If somebody asked you, "How can I pray for you?"
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.840]   What have you, how have you answered that?
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.200]   Maybe go on further.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.260]   Is there a prayer request that you've been asking?
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.440]   Maybe for the last year or maybe even longer than that.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.320]   Maybe there are some prayers that you've been praying for many, many years.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.840]   Can you think of what that is?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720]   Again, don't say it out loud.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.280]   I just want you to think about it for a second.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.120]   I want to ask you this question and it may sound like a strange question.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.300]   Have you ever considered that the very thing that you've been praying for may be the reason
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.120]   that causes you to be blind toward who Christ is?
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   Let me say it again.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   Maybe the very content of your prayer, the longing of your heart, is the very reason
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.920]   why you have not been able to have an intimate relationship with God or maybe feel distant.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   If you, again, you don't need to turn your Bibles there, but as we've been studying through
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   the book of Isaiah, God sends Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Hosea and different prophets to
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.600]   warn the nation of Israel that judgment is coming upon them.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.200]   And the judgment that's coming upon the nation of Israel at the particular time wasn't because
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.880]   they were busy worshiping idols.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.520]   In fact, they were very busy at the temple.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.960]   They're financially, politically more stable than they were in the previous years, at least
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.820]   in the southern kingdom.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.920]   And they were very busy at the temple offering many sacrifices.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000]   And yet God says that these sacrifices were meaningless.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.580]   He says in Isaiah 58, "Cry aloud, do not hold back, lift up your voice like a trumpet, declare
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.040]   to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins."
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   And again, he's telling Isaiah to say this on my behalf to the nation of Israel.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   "They seek me daily and delight to know my ways as if they were a nation that did righteousness
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.140]   and did not forsake the judgment of their God.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.560]   They ask me righteous judgment.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   They delight to draw near to God.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380]   Why have we fasted and you see it not?
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.960]   Why have we humbled ourselves and you take no knowledge of it?"
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.760]   In other words, we've been praying and fasting and coming to the temple, but they're frustrated
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.320]   because God's not answering.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.680]   "Behold, in the day of your fast, you seek your own pleasure and oppress all your workers.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   Behold, you fast only a quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked feast.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.940]   And that pretty much summarizes the judgment that was coming upon the nation of Israel.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.840]   They were very busy at the temple.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.520]   They're making many sacrifices and fasting even.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.480]   But God says to the nation of Israel, "Your fast is only for your own gain.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   You're not seeking me.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.600]   You're not seeking my glory.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.720]   All of the content of your prayer has nothing to do with me."
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.440]   So therefore, he says, judgment is coming.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.400]   In fact, God says again, it's much stronger than that in other passages where he actually
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.080]   even says, "I detest it.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   I detest your gathering.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.600]   I detest your singing.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.440]   It has nothing to do with me."
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.260]   Now why I say this this morning is because when we think about Palm Sunday, Palm Sunday
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.320]   is a day where Jesus, after three years of ministry, makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   And he's making an emphatic statement because for the last three years of his public ministry,
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.340]   there has been this question lingering over him.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.440]   Is he the Messiah?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.680]   Now, at the beginning of his ministry, he wouldn't say it clearly.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.120]   You know, he would just kind of give him hints and this is what it is and he would perform
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   miracles.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.960]   And then as he is getting closer and closer to the cross, he makes it absolutely crystal
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   clear.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.320]   "I am."
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.040]   He says to the Samaritan woman, he says again, over and over again, "I am."
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.720]   And then now, as he has revealed himself clearly to the disciples, he said to them three separate
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.880]   times that he's going to be crucified, he's going to be resurrected on the third day.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.280]   He tells them to go find this donkey that he's going to ride on into Jerusalem.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.840]   Now anybody who's been paying attention to scripture at that particular time would have
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   clearly known that this was a sign of the coming of the Messiah.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.400]   Zechariah 9.9, 550 years prior to Jesus entering into Jerusalem, has declared, "Rejoice greatly,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.120]   O daughter of Zion; shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   Behold, your King is coming to you, righteous and having salvation as He, humble and mounted
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.720]   on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.480]   It was a clear sign.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.260]   It was a public declaration, an exclamation mark that in case anybody was wondering who
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.400]   he was, Jesus was going to ride on this donkey after he performs probably the greatest miracle
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.120]   of his three years of ministry, raising Lazarus from the dead.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   So people have come all over, anybody who had any kind of question that maybe he isn't
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.040]   the Messiah, maybe just we're misinterpreting, he says it emphatically, "I am He."
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.320]   And as he is riding on the donkey, in the book of John, he said people were greeting
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.360]   him with palm branches.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.200]   The reason why they were greeting him with palm branches was because palm branch represented
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.840]   victory, that all that is good.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.040]   It was a kind of way to celebrate.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.760]   Typically at that time when an army would go out to war and they came back in victory,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.600]   it was their way of having a parade.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.800]   And so strange thing is, typically that kind of celebration was reserved for a military
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.540]   conquest.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.760]   But this was for an individual.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.440]   The significance of the palm branch wasn't started when Jesus came into Jerusalem.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.520]   In fact, it was all over Israel's history.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.280]   Solomon himself, when he built the temple, had the image of the palm branches all over
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.720]   the temple, inside the wall, outside the wall.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.800]   It was actually even printed upon the coins that they used.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.460]   Because again, it represented prosperity, it represented victory.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.080]   And then in Revelation chapter 7 and 9, it actually tells us that at the end times, when
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.760]   people are gathered together to worship God, that they are waving their palm branches because
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.200]   of the final victory that we're going to have in Christ.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.400]   But something strange is happening.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.320]   Even though it was a fulfillment of a prophecy, and we say it's either Palm Sunday or triumphal
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.560]   entry of Jesus.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:56.140]   But typically when a king or a leader or general would walk in after conquest, they would ride
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.560]   on a horse, right?
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.880]   And understandably because they're in battle, they're about to fight or they just finished
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   it.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.320]   But he's riding on a donkey.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   Typically they would ride on a donkey to signify that we're in peace, that there is no war
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.160]   going on.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.040]   So anybody who was paying attention would have seen that as a, well, Jesus is coming
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   in.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.440]   We call it a triumphal entry.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.160]   And we think that he's going to come and maybe overthrow the Roman government, and yet he's
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.640]   riding on a donkey.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.120]   In fact, there's something else that's not mentioned here that is very significant.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.840]   In Luke chapter 19, 41 through 44, it says, "When Jesus drew near and saw the city in
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.200]   Jerusalem as he is riding on a donkey," it says, "he wept over it."
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.260]   He wept.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.440]   Now this is in the context of a lot of commentaries believe that there are probably maybe over
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.120]   a million people, right?
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.240]   Now again, we live near Los Angeles and New York and these big cities.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.520]   We fly to Beijing and these cities, like one million is a drop in the bucket.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.960]   But at that particular time, a million people was probably the largest crowd that they may
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.440]   have ever seen in their life.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.360]   And so typically during the Passover week, there would have been hundreds of thousands
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.920]   of people in Jerusalem anyway.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.200]   But remember there's three years of murmuring going on all through that region, telling
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.440]   their friends and families that maybe this is the Messiah.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.040]   This is the guy that our great, great, great, great grandparents have been telling us and
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.240]   passing down.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.480]   Every time that we had a Passover meal, we were told that the One is coming.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.640]   And maybe if they paid attention more closely, they would have known that God promised that
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.280]   the seed of the woman is coming.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.340]   Maybe it's Him.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.320]   So you can imagine, you can imagine the kind of crowd that was gathered and was waving
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320]   these palm branches.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.280]   It wasn't just passive, you know.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.920]   There wasn't this kind of like, "Ah, we've got to put in our time like the previous years.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.520]   Oh, we've got to make this what good Jews do."
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.580]   There probably was a kind of excitement that they've never seen before, right?
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.520]   It's in the context of this celebration, this parade, that it says in the midst of this,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.440]   Jesus was weeping.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.320]   It doesn't tell us what the disciples saw.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.880]   It doesn't tell us how they responded.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.520]   It doesn't, because it's a very strange scene.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.740]   It's like having a birthday party and the birthday boy is sitting there weeping in the
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.040]   corner and nobody notices.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.600]   We're all just cutting cake and celebrating, high-fiving, watching TV, and we have no idea.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.880]   There's no mention of it.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.040]   It's extremely significant because there's only two places in the New Testament, in the
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.800]   account of Jesus, where it says Jesus wept.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.120]   First time that happens is in John chapter 11, 35, where his disciples and his family
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.080]   friends and Lazarus, Mary, and Martha is begging him to come because Lazarus is about to die
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.160]   and Jesus deliberately takes his time, waiting for him to pass away.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.160]   So by the time he comes, Lazarus has already been dead for three days.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.200]   Martha and Mary come weeping and he goes to the tomb and all these people are weeping.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:20.360]   And it says, the shortest verse in the Bible, John 11, 35, that Jesus wept.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   That's the first time we hear where Jesus was weeping.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.880]   You know what's interesting about that word though, is those of you who are with us when
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.040]   we're studying through John, that that word here described for Jesus as weeping, even
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.520]   though in our English Bible it's translated weeping, the word for weeping in the Greek,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.520]   it's two different words.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.880]   The word that was used to describe the crowd and Mary and Martha weeping is a different
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.920]   word than the word that is described for Jesus weeping in front of the temple.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.600]   The word that is described for the crowds was an outcry of emotion, which we would expect.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.960]   A younger brother, you know, who passed away before his time and everybody is mourning
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.900]   over this, crying out loud, uncontrollable, weeping.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.300]   That's the word used for the crowd.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.800]   But the word that is used for Jesus is a silent tear, you know, a man tear.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.520]   I think that's the best way to describe it, where it's just kind of, you just don't notice
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.400]   it, he just kind of sat in it.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.440]   That's the word that is used.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   So when the scripture says he wept, that's again, not the most accurate term.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.480]   But when we come to Jesus walking into Jerusalem, the word that is used to say that Jesus wept
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.440]   was that actual word, but uncontrollable outburst of emotion of weeping.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.780]   It wasn't a silent tear.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.440]   It was in the midst of this huge parade.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.000]   Jesus was actually weeping over Jerusalem.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.040]   That's strange.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.480]   Why was he weeping?
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.760]   When everybody was celebrating him, they were citing a psalm, "Save us, Hosanna, Hosanna,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   we pray.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.740]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.640]   We bless you from the house of the Lord."
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.000]   They were praising him and worshiping him.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.760]   And yet Jesus was not simply crying.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   He wasn't just sad.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.520]   He was weeping.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.280]   What caused him to weep?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.880]   And that's an important question that we need to answer this morning.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.280]   Because again, there's only two instances.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:25.780]   In the second instance where he's actually weeping, like he's so overwhelmed by his emotions.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:33.640]   It says in verse 42, Luke chapter 19, saying, "If you have only known on this day, the thing
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.240]   that would make for peace."
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.640]   In other words, if you only knew why I came.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.680]   In other words, they were looking for shalom, which is the Hebrew word for peace.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   And they completely missed it.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.760]   Even though they were celebrating him, even though they were praising him, even though
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.880]   they were worshiping him.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.920]   And they traveled miles, days probably, many of them, to come just to witness him.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:08.000]   He said all of that may have been for nothing because they completely missed who he was.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.280]   And as a result of that, he says, "For the days will come upon you when your enemies
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.480]   will set up a barricade around you, surround you, and hem you in on every side, and tear
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   you down to the ground, and you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.000]   upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.920]   That you're in a context of celebrating, worshiping, crying out, and yet you completely missed who
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.440]   I am.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:47.320]   See, he says, "If you only knew what would truly bring peace, you would know why I came."
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.720]   Now, that's at the center of why Jesus was weeping.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.200]   And that's at the center of him coming into Jerusalem.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.880]   If you missed this, you missed Christianity.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   You missed Christ.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.840]   You can come to church all your life and be celebrating and worshiping and praying and
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   fasting.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.120]   And at the end of it, Jesus could say, "I never knew you."
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.480]   I think that's the greatest tragedy of Christianity, especially in North America, because we are
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   bombarded.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.760]   The name of God is written on our money.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.160]   It's in the Constitution.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.720]   We have freedom like no other country in the world.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.320]   We have a problem when we can't say, "Merry Christmas," because we had all kinds of freedom
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.480]   for so many years.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.720]   And in the midst of all of this freedom, all this access to Scripture, all this access
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.200]   to sermons and seminars and education and fellowship and church, that at the end of
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.020]   it, he says, "Why do you keep coming to me?
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.720]   Your fasting has nothing to do with me."
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:58.600]   See, Palm Sunday, even though it wasn't an official rejection of Christ, as far as he
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.440]   saw it, he was being rejected.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:10.740]   Even as they were praising him, he knew that at the end of this, they would reject him.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.920]   What does he mean that they missed the peace?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.840]   We need to understand, if that's at the core of why he was weeping, what was it that they
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   missed?
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.800]   Well, when we say peace in the English, you know, we think of state of tranquility.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.560]   You know, maybe your life is hectic and you need to meditate and go into the woods and
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.080]   do some yoga or whatever, you know what I mean, to get you centered.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.680]   Or freedom from civil disturbance.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.280]   We're not, at least not in our immediate area.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.840]   There's no riots, there's no war that we're actively engaged in.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   You're not being recruited to the army.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.560]   I mean, there's stuff going on outside the country.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.440]   We think of peace that way.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.600]   Or maybe harmony in relationship.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.640]   Maybe you've had some problems with people and you're sitting down to make peace with
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   one another.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   And typically, all of these things, the meaning behind it is included in this meaning.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:11.120]   But the word shalom that the Jews use, which is the translated peace in the New Testament,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.960]   has a much deeper meaning than that.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.640]   It was at the core of their culture.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.480]   Some of you who may have lived in Hawaii or visited Hawaii or have family members in Hawaii,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.160]   you know what this is, right?
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.240]   Hang loose, right?
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.360]   Hang loose, or you know.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.040]   It's a very kickback culture in Hawaii.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.320]   So in Hawaii, there's a, you know, this is their greeting for everything.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.920]   It's a mahalo, right?
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.800]   They say mahalo when they see you.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.440]   They say mahalo when they say bye.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   Mahalo means like, you know, peace.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.880]   Mahalo means pretty much mahalo for everything, right?
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.600]   Mahalo for the surfers, mahalo for the governors.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   It's just mahalo.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.840]   This signifies like kick back, relax, right?
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.120]   That's at the core of the culture in Hawaii.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.960]   Well, at the core of the Jewish culture was shalom.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.920]   They said shalom when they left.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.000]   They said shalom when they greeted one another.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.760]   Shalom was at the center of everything that they did.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.960]   In fact, in the Jewish Talmud, which was basically a commentary of the Old Testament, it's a
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.760]   Jewish commentary of the Old Testament.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.960]   This is what's stated in one of their pages.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.720]   All that is written in the Torah was written for the sake of shalom.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.440]   Okay, let me say that again.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.720]   All that is written in the Torah, and Torah basically is the law that they were trying
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.560]   to abide by, Old Testament, was written for the sake of shalom.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.000]   Now, this is not written by a Christian.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.200]   This is written by Jewish scholars who are interpreting the Old Testament, and they recognize
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.640]   that the core of everything that God was doing was shalom.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   So we need to understand, if it's this significant, when Jesus said, "I'm weeping because judgment
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.040]   is coming because you missed, if you only knew what would bring shalom, this judgment
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.920]   would not be coming to you."
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.360]   The meaning behind this word is, again, extremely important.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.280]   So if you're clicked off right now, click back on.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.680]   This part is extremely important.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.000]   This is one of those sections that I would tell you that if you missed it, go back.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   Go back and listen to the sermon online.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.040]   Ask somebody because it's at the root, at the core of what Christianity really is about.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.160]   So when Jesus is talking about, "Oh, only if you knew that, you know, what is going
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.320]   to bring peace between you and the Romans, or what's going to bring peace between your
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.600]   husband and wife," He's talking about the essence of everything that God's been doing
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.560]   in human history is represented in this shalom.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.240]   So what does He mean?
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:53.640]   Well, the root word where we get the word shalom in Hebrew is shalayim.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   And the word shalayim means completion, to be whole.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:06.680]   So the idea of shalom means to be whole, to be made perfect, to be restored to what God
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.180]   originally intended.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.000]   So when they said shalom, they weren't simply talking about, "Hey, you know, have peace.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Don't be stressed out.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Hey, relax, mahalo."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.560]   Right?
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.760]   When they said shalom, shalom basically meant everything that was lost in the fall may be
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   restored.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.160]   At least that's the way we understand it.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.480]   See, again, this idea of shalom is so deeply rooted into the scripture.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.640]   And if you don't pay very close attention to it, you might miss it.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.960]   If shalom means to be complete, to be made whole, remember when God created the earth
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.000]   and mankind in six days, He was complete.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.040]   And then after He was done, He went, entered into what?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.680]   Sabbath, right?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.920]   Shabbat.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.120]   So when He entered into Sabbath, did He enter into the Sabbath because He needed to rest?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.760]   Now the word itself means rest.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.760]   Was God exhausted?
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.360]   He needed to take a break?
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.640]   Like you and I need to take a break.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.840]   We need at least Saturday, Sunday, maybe partially Monday or whatever, right?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   To get back and ready.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   Is that what God was doing?
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.720]   Six days, a long time, right?
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.480]   No, obviously not.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.320]   He is immutable.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.800]   Every quality that He has does not change, does not wither, right?
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   So when He entered the Sabbath, He's not simply talking about, "Okay, take a break, and I'm
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.280]   going to give you an example of what it means to take a break."
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.000]   The idea, or the biblical idea of Shabbat is that everything is complete and now you
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.400]   are in this permanent rest.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:46.600]   So remember, what was Jesus' last words as He was being crucified and He gave up His
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   last breath?
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.760]   What was it that He said?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.080]   It is finished.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   It is finished.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.560]   See, when God created the creation after six days, what did He say?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   He said, "It is good.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   It is good.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   It is good.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   It is good."
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   He said, "Look, that man is not good."
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   And then He created Eve.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   He said, "Now it is good."
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   And then He created the Son of God.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   What was that?
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560]   He says, "It is finished."
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.000]   So the idea of Shabbat, Sabbath, is to enter into completion.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.320]   Wholeness, what God intended in creation.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.280]   And so it was at the fall that the Shabbat was broken.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.500]   That this rest was broken.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.600]   What God intended, this completeness, was broken.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:36.380]   So ever since then, mankind has been looking for this shalom, to be made whole again.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:43.360]   So to a Jew, to say shalom is, whatever has been broken in your life, when God comes and
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.720]   He blesses you, you will be restored.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:53.040]   What's interesting is in the New Testament, we have an equivalent word to this word shalom.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.400]   And we would think, oh, it's the word grace, or it's the word peace.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.500]   Actually, 1 Corinthians 13.10, there's a passage that says, "When the perfect comes, the imperfect
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.000]   shall pass away."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.200]   Now some people translate that verse as, "The perfect is the Bible."
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.480]   So once the Bible came, all the prophecies and speaking in tongues, all that would disappear.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.120]   But actually, the word that is used for complete in that word, in that text, is teleos.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.960]   Now remember, I did a whole paper when I was in seminary on just that word, because of
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.620]   the importance of that word.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:30.240]   The word, and most scholars will agree, is talking about an intended purpose carrying
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.760]   it, being carried out to its fullest intent.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.840]   So some people will say, "That's Jesus.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.400]   That we see Him partially, but then when He comes, we will see the complete version of
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Him."
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.840]   Or, many people will translate that as, "The completion of salvation for us."
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:52.280]   That He started a good work in us, we'll carry it on to completion, teleos, when He comes.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.360]   Whatever way you translate that word, the word basically means to bring us into wholeness,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.080]   to completeness.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.460]   What was lost in creation.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:07.320]   So all of what we know about God's creation, all of what we know about the fall, all of
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.160]   what we know about God sending His only begotten Son, and salvation and sanctification, second
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:21.800]   coming and restoration, and heaven, all of that is symbolized in this word, shalom.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.920]   All of what we know about Christianity, about Jesus, is about shalom.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.620]   In fact, this shalom is so important, in Isaiah 54 verse 10, the covenant that God makes with
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.060]   His people is called the covenant of shalom.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:45.540]   In Judges chapter 6, 24, the Lord is called the Lord our shalom.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:53.140]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 23, in the New Testament, God is introduced to us as the God of shalom.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.180]   The preaching of the gospel is described as preaching shalom, peace, to those who are
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.020]   far and to those who are near.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.780]   In Romans chapter 5, 1, describes salvation as having shalom with God.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.980]   And then finally, ultimately, in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6, a prophecy of the coming Messiah,
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.620]   and He is called the Prince of Shalom.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.900]   So how important is this shalom?
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.900]   It's everything.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.900]   Everything.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.580]   If you miss shalom, you missed everything.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.340]   So Jesus wasn't simply saying, I'm coming in and you just, you know, you don't fully
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340]   get me, right?
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.940]   A lot of times in husband and wives or, you know, marriage counseling, we get that, we
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.860]   talk about that, you don't fully understand.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.260]   Like you understand some stuff, but there's some things that you don't understand.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.940]   What Jesus was saying, basically, that you don't understand a part of me, you don't understand
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.880]   at all.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:53.800]   These people were praying to Him, they were crying out to Him, they were worshiping Him,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.580]   they were shaking palm branches of celebration of Him coming into Jerusalem.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:06.140]   And yet, Jesus is saying, you have no idea who I am.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.420]   And that's why He was weeping.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:19.080]   It says in John chapter 6, 15, that the multitudes who tasted the heavenly bread, the miracle
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.380]   of feeding the 5,000.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:29.040]   After they tasted His bread and it was eyewitnesses of this miracle, there was a stir, let's make
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.020]   Him our King.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.780]   And it says in John chapter 6, 15, they were trying to get Him and forcefully make Him
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.800]   His King, make Him their King.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.860]   So Jesus knowing this, He deliberately takes His disciples and sends them across to see
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.100]   a reality, I'll meet you on the other side.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.700]   And so Jesus basically breaks away from them.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.140]   These people wake up in the morning, find out that Jesus is not there, so all of them,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.620]   within thousands of them, pack up their bags and they go look for Him on the other side.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.460]   They finally find Him and they say, Jesus, when did you come here?
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.740]   Jesus seeing right through, right through their motive, and He says, you're not coming
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.060]   after me because you saw signs and you know who I am.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   You're coming after me because you ate and you want more.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.420]   It's in that conversation where Jesus tells them, because He knew their hardened heart,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.420]   they up to that point, they loved Him.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.060]   Up to that point, they wanted Him to be King.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.660]   Who wouldn't want Jesus as King?
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.300]   I mean, right now we're in election season and these politicians are making all kinds
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.580]   of promises that if you just elect them, they're going to bring peace, they're going to bring
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580]   financial prosperity.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:38.500]   I mean, if they do 1% of what we do, we would be in a much better situation, at least what
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.540]   they're promising.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.980]   But Jesus actually healed people.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.740]   He fed people who were hungry.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.900]   Lepers who were shunned from society were able to go and have a normal life when He
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.900]   was around.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:58.500]   Even in the midst of storms where death was imminent, Jesus just wakes up and says, be
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.420]   quiet and it calms the storm.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.220]   They couldn't even trap Him.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.260]   All these legal stuff that they were wrestling with, Jesus says one thing, right?
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:16.220]   And His figure, give to Caesar what's Caesar and give to God what is God, boom, answered.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.580]   His teaching was different.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.140]   He was speaking with authority.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.060]   When these scribes and Pharisees were teaching, they were saying good things, but they were
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.060]   so hypocritical.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.380]   And yet Jesus speaks with authority.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.780]   Who wouldn't want Him as King?
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.580]   If you're sick, He heals you.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.940]   If you're hurt, He comes and draws near to you.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.900]   If you're hungry, He feeds you.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:45.300]   If you're dejected, He will come and save you.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:52.540]   I mean, why are we following Christ?
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.340]   What is our motive?
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.800]   What drew you to Him?
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.340]   What is the content of your prayer?
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.700]   See those people missed Him because Jesus saw right through it and is like, you know,
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.620]   because He knew the moment you don't get fed, you're going to turn from me.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:17.140]   The Pharisees, they prayed every Tuesday, every Thursday, they fasted, they sacrificed
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.680]   money, they came to the temple, they tried to obey the law and they prayed.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.540]   They probably prayed more than we prayed, much more than we prayed, but they clung to
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:34.140]   God and they prayed and prayed and prayed that if they obeyed the law well enough, that
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.800]   somehow shalom is going to come.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.220]   And when Jesus came and said that was not the way you need to be born again, they couldn't
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.100]   understand that.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.980]   When He completely shunned their system, He said, He can't be the one.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   So they rejected Him.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:55.620]   The Sadducees, the political leaders, the senators of Israel, they've given up on prayer
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.660]   a long time ago.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.580]   We've tried that and it didn't work.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.820]   And they decided that by their money, with their power, with influence, that somehow
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.820]   they're going to manipulate and get the nation to get the favor of the Romans.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.500]   And so they had all this plan and Jesus comes in and He shuns all of that.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.140]   He starts saying things that are offensive to people.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.340]   He said, we've got to get rid of this guy.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.540]   This guy is going to ruin what we've been building all these years.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:23.300]   If we worked hard enough, if we were smart enough, if we're clever enough, if we have
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.020]   enough influence enough, that we would get Shalom.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.060]   And so they missed Him.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.340]   They had the zealots.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.540]   He had zealots even among His disciples.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.340]   These zealots were the kind of guys who were walking around with a knife ready to go at
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.420]   any time.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.700]   Imagine how excited they must have been when Jesus was entering into Jerusalem.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.900]   You know, up to now they probably have different commanders and maybe they were caught and
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.340]   they were crucified and they just couldn't muster up enough strength.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:58.220]   And then here comes Jesus who can calm storms, feed thousands just by His will.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.220]   If He was our commander, for sure, if we had any chance of overthrowing the Roman government,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.820]   it would have been Jesus.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:11.540]   And yet when Jesus comes and He gives Himself up to the Romans, they're watching Him from
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   a distance.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.540]   Wait a second.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   This doesn't make any sense.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:21.780]   Because they thought that if they were powerful enough, if they willed themselves enough,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.700]   if they trained themselves, if they had the backing of enough power, that they would be
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.420]   able to find Shalom.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.980]   And they missed Him.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.900]   But it wasn't just these disciples from a distance.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   These lepers.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.060]   Remember these lepers?
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.300]   You know, these ten lepers that, imagine what they were praying for.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.540]   We don't even have to imagine, right?
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.460]   If you asked a leper, what was your primary desire in your heart?
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.740]   It would be cleanse of leprosy.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.980]   I mean, we don't even have to guess.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.900]   Because leprosy ruins someone's life.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.180]   Immediately, if there was any trace of leprosy, you would be shunned from your very home.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.300]   In your mother and father's home, you would be shunned.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.580]   You'd have to live outside the city.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.060]   Not only did you have to live outside with other lepers, every time you made any contact
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.900]   with any other Jew, you had to cry out, "Unclean!
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.460]   Unclean!"
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:26.060]   And if he got any close, by the law, they could stone him for not obeying that command.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.060]   So imagine, someone who had leprosy, what his prayers were.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.860]   He probably prayed day and night.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.580]   Not only him, his mother, father, anybody who loved him, would pray day and night for
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.500]   cleansing.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:45.220]   And yet, when Jesus cleansed them, they thought they had their shalom.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.780]   They thought they had their shalom, and nine of them returned.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.060]   And they go back, they completely forget, because we got it!
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.940]   We got what we wanted!
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:58.620]   And only one Samaritan comes back and recognizes, recognizes that that wasn't the shalom.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.860]   And they come back to thank him.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:08.340]   Even the disciples, even as Jesus clearly spells out that he's going to the cross and
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.700]   die, they couldn't help but thinking, "Well, once that happens, who's going to be glorified?
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.420]   Who's going to sit on the left or to the right?
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.020]   Who is the greatest among us?"
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.080]   And even they didn't get it.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.180]   They thought if they stayed near to his power, that somehow they were going to get his shalom.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.300]   And so when Jesus was humiliated and humbled and beaten and crucified, they watched him
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.140]   from a distance because they just didn't get it.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.180]   How can he give us shalom on the cross?
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.100]   How can he give us shalom if he dies?
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.100]   What was it?
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.620]   And they're in utter confusion, and they scatter.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.620]   See, Jesus sees all of it.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.940]   He sees all of it.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.740]   Even though they're praising him, even though they're waving palm branches, they're crying
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:04.620]   out, and even in their fasting, and their many sacrifices, they didn't really understand.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:10.500]   In John 1, 5, it says, "The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   it."
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:18.700]   See, Palm Sunday is about rejection of Christ.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.060]   Yes, there's celebration.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   This is the parade.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.180]   It is a triumphal entry.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:31.380]   You know, years ago, I was trying to help a guy that I met on the street.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.380]   We became good friends.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.740]   He was a drug addict, and I just thought that if I spent enough time with him and got him
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.940]   out of the street and put him in a hotel, that somehow he's going to be able to get
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.100]   out of ... Because he was a great guy, and I know there's few people in this room that
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.700]   was there when we were doing this.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.020]   It was frustrating because we would check him into a hotel, and then he'd be good for
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.020]   a while, for 10 days, and then he'd disappear, and then he'd come back and weeping because
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.380]   he somehow found crack, and he was gone for a week.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.620]   Then, we moved him further away from Santa Ana, so maybe we thought if we take him farther
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.260]   and farther away from Santa Ana, he's not going to have access to cocaine.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:13.380]   Then, he'll be doing good for a while, and then after a while, he'd disappear.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:19.540]   I remember the church guys bought him brand new basketball shoes, expensive shoes because
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.540]   we became good friends.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.300]   We played basketball after church, and then he disappeared, and he would show up barefoot,
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   weeping.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:31.820]   I was disappointed in him, but at the same time, I was just like, "What do we do?
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.860]   I'm trying everything."
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.340]   We made a decision, "Okay, maybe if he'd live with us, and I can watch him and be with him,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.020]   that somehow that's going to help him."
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.420]   Well, he was doing fine for a while, got a job, good paying job because he was a machinist,
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.940]   and then two, three weeks passes, and the next thing I know, he disappears again.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.500]   The bike that we got him to travel back and forth, he sold that and then got crack.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.580]   In the end, I was so frustrated, it's like, "This is beyond me."
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.740]   He genuinely wanted to change.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.700]   Again, he was not the first guy.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.020]   It was about the second or third guy that was trying to help with that, and every single
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.060]   one, humanly speaking, was a failure.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.980]   At the end of that, it's like, "Man, I have no idea what to do."
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:20.660]   I just remember thinking at that time, "Unless the Lord sets you free, it's just bandage.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.660]   It's dealing with symptoms.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.660]   Symptoms.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.860]   If you're hungry, you feed them.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.860]   Just a symptom.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:31.420]   It's just like somebody has cancer, and you're just dealing with the symptoms, but there's
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.580]   no cure for cancer."
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:38.020]   See, what Jesus came to do was not to patch.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.060]   And yes, the lepers got healed, but eventually, they died.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.380]   Yes, the lame started walking, and eventually, they died.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.900]   The hungry were fed, and eventually, they died.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:58.620]   And all the hopes and the prayers, sometimes, that we offer up to God are just consequences
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.700]   of our sin.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:08.100]   And we're asking God to deal with the symptoms of these things, not recognizing what it is
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.860]   that we are in desperate need of.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.260]   That's why Jesus was weeping.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:22.700]   Because the very core of the things that we pray for is what causes us to be blind.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.540]   Is He the God of the Bible?
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.980]   Is He the God that I've created and longing for in my heart?
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.540]   On Friday, I lost my wallet.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.540]   And I looked everywhere.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.500]   And obviously, anybody who's ever lost a wallet, you know exactly how that feels.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.020]   And especially for me, because I'm going out of town in a couple weeks, and I was thinking
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.740]   like, "I need my driver's license."
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.380]   You know, and like, "Am I going to be able to get through security?
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.380]   Is the passport?"
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.860]   And I was thinking, "You know, you're not going to get a duplicate driver's license
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   in a week and a half."
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.660]   So I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm in big trouble."
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.180]   And so, as soon as I came home, I canceled all my credit cards, about four or five of
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.620]   them, my wallet, my debit card, canceled all of that.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:10.780]   You know, I had two checks in my wallet, so I sent an email to Joe and Kevin and said,
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.300]   "Hey, those two checks, you know, I didn't clear yet.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   You know, can you cancel that?"
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   And I sent that.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.020]   And I was thinking, I had a Costco gift card in there, and I don't know how much is in
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.020]   there.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.020]   So, okay, that's lost.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.020]   Okay, there's no way I can replace that.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.260]   And I had a Costco rebate check that I didn't, you know, I didn't clear yet.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.420]   So I was like, "Okay, that's lost.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.660]   They're not going to give me another one."
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.380]   And then I had some cash in there.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.380]   Okay.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.380]   And then I was thinking, "Okay, so that's lost."
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.860]   I was going through all of this and going back into my car and looking for it.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.300]   And so I stayed up late dealing with all that and went to sleep.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.020]   And then, so nobody at home knew, you know, I came home late, so they were all sleeping.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.900]   Nobody knew that I lost my wallet.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.280]   I woke up early, went to the leaders meeting.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.420]   And then, you know, me and Jeremy, my oldest son, had to switch cars.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.820]   So I took his car and went to the leaders meeting.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.260]   And then Jeremy took my car, and he's out of town now, you know.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.620]   And but on the way out, he calls me around 8.30 or 9 o'clock.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.460]   And he doesn't even know that I lost my wallet.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.460]   He called me and he said, "Hey, Dad, you left your wallet in the car.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.740]   What do you want me to do with it?"
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.540]   So I'm, you know, all this stuff is going through my mind.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.740]   I'm thinking, "Did you steal my wallet and then put it back?"
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.180]   Because I looked everywhere.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.500]   You know, I was frantic looking for that.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.260]   Checked all the side pockets and all this.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.580]   To this day, I don't know how he found it, you know, because he went out of town.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.060]   So when he comes back, I'm going to ask him.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:38.260]   He's probably going to say, "It was right there," you know.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.980]   It must have been because he didn't even look for it.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   I didn't ask for it.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.660]   He, all he did was, he sat in the car and he was about to drive away.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.740]   He said, "Oh, I see Dad's wallet," right?
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.100]   Because he didn't know I lost it, right?
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.500]   So even now I'm thinking, like, "Where could it have been?
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.260]   I went to the, you know, and I said this to the first service, and people started coming
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.460]   up to me, "Did you check underneath the seat?"
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.140]   No, I checked everywhere but that.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.140]   That's what happened, okay?
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.140]   How about the side?
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.140]   No, I didn't check that either, all right?
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.700]   Glove compartment?
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.660]   They're not here, so I can rip on them, all right?
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.780]   In my mind, I checked everywhere.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.980]   I checked everywhere.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   So I'm curious where it was.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.900]   When he comes, I'm going to ask him, right?
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.660]   Obviously, it was in plain sight because he didn't dig anywhere.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.500]   So the only thing I could think of is maybe I dropped it and it was behind, maybe I was
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.140]   sitting on it, I didn't feel it.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.860]   But I got out of the car and I looked.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.860]   Maybe it was too dark.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.940]   You know, my wallet is dark tone, so maybe it just kind of blended.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.180]   So I'm thinking all this stuff, but wherever it was, all he did was open the door and looked
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.140]   in and there was my wallet, right?
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.700]   Other than the fact that I'm not good at looking, which is, Esther always tells me that, right?
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.140]   It's like, "Oh, I can't find it."
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.540]   She walks into the garage, comes back, "It's right here.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   It's right here."
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.660]   So it could be one of those situations.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.300]   But this is in a tiny little space.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   Where could it have gone?
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.660]   And all of a sudden, it popped back out, right?
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.660]   It's a mystery.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.660]   I'll find out when he comes home.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:16.020]   Sometimes we get so accustomed to doing certain things, so accustomed to that, and we become
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.580]   blind to certain things.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:26.620]   Like, you come to church and you hear sermons in small groups and cleaning and Bible studies,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.460]   and we become so accustomed to that.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.060]   Sometimes we see what's obvious, but there are certain things that ... So a lot of times,
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.740]   somebody comes outside from the church and they immediately see, "Oh, this church is
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.020]   like this," or, "Oh, it's this and that," and then say, "Oh, that's good," because they're
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.780]   coming and they see a different perspective, right?
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.620]   The reason why things like Passion Week is important to us is because sometimes we can
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.980]   get caught up in routine, just like the Jews.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.220]   They had all this stuff that they were doing wrong and God was not pleased with, and all
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.940]   they thought was, "Well, if we keep giving sacrifices, God's going to be pleased.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.660]   Why wouldn't He be pleased?"
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.300]   And it wasn't until God sends Isaiah and says, "No.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.780]   You have no idea where you stand with me."
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:10.900]   So it's important for us to take time, especially when it's not just us, it's not just locally.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:16.100]   All over the world, Christians are going to take this week to meditate and think upon
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.460]   who He is and what He has done so that when we get to Sunday, that we're actually celebrating.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.980]   It's not just, "Ah, Easter."
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.780]   Our church has been around almost 20 years.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.660]   It's a lot of things that, especially those of you who have been around for a while, it's
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.420]   just everything has become routine.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.680]   Nothing is new.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.900]   Every story has been told 10 times.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.700]   Every funny joke is not funny anymore, right?
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:43.860]   And it's just, it's become so routine that we become blind to the things that are amazing.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   Amazing.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:50.740]   And it's important for us to take time to re-examine, take a deeper look at the things
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:56.820]   that we celebrate every single week so that we're not just coming and going like we've
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.140]   always done.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.340]   That every celebration is a true celebration.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:08.340]   So again, as we start off this Passion Week, I want to encourage you guys to take time,
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.140]   not to simply go through the same routines that you've been going through.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:18.540]   Even if you can't join us physically, to take some time to think and meditate deeply.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.580]   Who is this God that I worship?
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.980]   Who am I?
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.580]   Why did I need saving?
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.140]   Why did it have to be that way?
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.840]   Am I missing shalom?
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.980]   Do I truly know this shalom?
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.220]   And take some time this week to really walk through Christ that again, when we come to
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.780]   celebrate that we'll be impacted as this day ought to.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:45.140]   Would you take some time to pray with me as I invite the praise team to come up?
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:51.980]   Can take some time to pray as we discussed this morning about this shalom, this peace
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.700]   with God.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.700]   Is there a rest?
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   Is there a complete?
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.100]   Do I find my completion in Christ and what He has done?
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.780]   Or am I looking for shalom in all these other places?
