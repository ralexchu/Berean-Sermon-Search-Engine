[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   We're going to be reading verses 9 and 10, but it's within the context of the whole rest
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.680]   of the chapter, verse 21.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.620]   Romans chapter 12, verses 9 and 10.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.620]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.700]   "Let love be genuine.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.080]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.960]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.320]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.120]   Outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:35.520]   Heavenly Father, we want to praise you and thank you for sustaining us, for interceding
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.680]   on our behalf, for being patient with us, for being our hope, our goal.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.280]   We desire, Lord God, that all these things that we are studying, that we are singing,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.000]   that one day would be actualized, Lord God, in your coming.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.800]   And to that end, help us to put our hope, our desire, our energy, our lives, Lord God,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.560]   in passionate pursuit of the things that honor you for eternal things, Lord God, not things
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.700]   that will perish with our flesh.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.920]   We pray that your word would remind us again of the importance of what it means to love.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.280]   Help us, Lord, within the context of your grace to actually apply and to tangibly live
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.040]   in a way that honors you.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.480]   May your grace be sufficient this morning, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.400]   Alright, so as we jump back into the book of Romans, chapter 12, again, to give you
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.040]   the larger context, he begins in verse 12 because there's a major transition that takes
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.040]   place in chapter 12 where he says, "In view of God's mercy, to present your bodies a living
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   sacrifice."
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   So he's talking about 11 chapters of summary of what God has done for us.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   Basically, it's a detailed message of the gospel.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   And he needed to do that because the imperative, the commandments that he's giving us starting
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   from chapter 12 is going to be placed on top of that foundation.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   So without that foundation, everything that he commands here, it can easily just become
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.480]   a burden.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.800]   So in appeal, based upon this mercy and grace, he says that our reasonable response ought
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.080]   to be a living sacrifice to God, that not just a part, not just certain portions of
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   our life, but all of it should be a living sacrifice.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.200]   Well, how do we do that?
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.240]   The first thing that he says in verse 2 is to not to be conformed to this world, but
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.280]   be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.520]   So again, a practical application of what it means to live a life as a living sacrifice
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.680]   in verse 2, not to be conformed, but be transformed.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.640]   And then the application in which we are to live our Christian lives, he gives a context
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.400]   of that in verse 3 to verse 8, within the context of the body of Christ.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.140]   But where do we practice our Christianity?
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.520]   The gifts that he's given, generosity, whatever gifts that we've given, he has given us the
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.240]   body of Christ, that we are his body.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.000]   And to offer our physical body as a living sacrifice, first and foremost, happens in
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   the local church.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.940]   So, Christians cannot be attached in a personal relationship with Christ if we are not physically
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.880]   attached to the physical body of Christ, which is his local church.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.320]   And that's the context that we were talking about in verses 3 and 8.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.880]   So the verses 9 through 21, he's giving us that if we are to live our lives, the specific
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.680]   gifts that he's given us, within the context of the body of Christ, verses 9 through 21
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.760]   is the explanation of biblical love that needs to be the foundation and the motivation and
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.720]   the fuel that causes us to be able to live a life worthy of the gospel.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.920]   So verses 9 through 21, Apostle Paul is going to give rapid fire commandments, which ultimately
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.840]   is a description of biblical love.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   And so he gives anywhere from 21 through 24 different descriptions or imperatives that's
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.800]   going to describe for us what he means by love, what he commands in this practice of
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.320]   love.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.080]   So what we're going to do for the next maybe about 4 or 5 weeks, we're going to just go
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.080]   through it.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.560]   Today we're going to go through verses 9 and 10, about 5 different descriptions of how
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.640]   to apply the gospel in our lives, specifically in love.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   And then we're going to work through all of it to the end of verse 21.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.480]   And I think if you've been a Christian for any period of time, I don't think I need to
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.920]   remind you just how important and foundational this is.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.040]   The practice of love, the commandment of love, Jesus said, is the essence of who we are.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.360]   Jesus says in John chapter 13, "The world is going to identify you by this love, as
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   I have loved you that you love one another."
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.760]   So our very identity, the whole reason why we've been saved is to practice this love.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.840]   In fact, Romans chapter 13, 8, he says, "Oh no one, anything, except to love each other,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.480]   for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law."
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.360]   So think about all the commandments.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.960]   Think about all the commandments of keeping the Sabbath holy, about cleanness, uncleanness,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.040]   and the 10 commandments.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.280]   And he says all of that, all the commandments in the New Testament, all the commandments
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   in the Old Testament, all of it, his ultimate goal is to cause us to love.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.360]   That's basically what he is saying.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.840]   That's the reason why he told us to keep the Sabbath.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.040]   That's the reason why he told us not to covet.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.880]   That's the reason why he wanted us to be holy.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.520]   All of it is summed up in love.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.800]   Galatians chapter 5, 14, "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, 'You shall love
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.040]   your neighbor as yourself.'"
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   Everything that we've been learning up to this point, everything that he has done, ultimately
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.340]   is fulfilled with that practice of love.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.200]   First John 4, 7, "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.020]   loves has been born of God and knows God."
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.480]   So if we are confessing Christians and we are followers of Jesus Christ, the identifying
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   mark of a Christian, again, in First John says it is love.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.560]   So I don't have to repeat to you, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, this
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.080]   is not deep theology that you have to go to seminary to exposit.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.380]   You don't have to sit under the expository preaching for years to be able to figure out
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.020]   that that's the core of what God calls us to be.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.720]   You can be a brand new Christian and read through the gospel even one time, and you'll
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.080]   understand that Jesus is pointing us to the practice of love.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.120]   Having said that, there is no other commandment that is more burdensome than this commandment.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.000]   If you've ever tried to practice biblical love, there's nothing more draining, there's
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.680]   nothing more that will suck the life out of you than to practice this biblical love.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.480]   Some of you guys may say, "Well, I don't know if that's the case for me."
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.680]   You have to understand that the commandment to love is not a commandment to be better
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.400]   friends to your friends.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.160]   It's not a commandment to be a better son, to be a better husband, to be a better wife,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.040]   which all of that is true.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.640]   But when he said the identifying mark of a Christian is to love as I have loved you,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   it goes way beyond what the world practices.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   So the biblical love, that's why in the title I said not just love, but biblical love, what
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.160]   Jesus said was love, how he practiced love, and what he ultimately is commanding us of
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   love.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   See, the love that oftentimes that we practice in the church is no different than the love
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.080]   that the world practices.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.160]   To be good friends, you know, and you hear this command, "Yeah, I need to love, and
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.040]   it's the greatest commandment," and then we think of these friends that maybe I've
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.600]   ignored, you know, maybe I need to be better to my wife or my husband.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.580]   You can listen to Oprah.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.920]   You can go to, you can go to, you know, a Buddhist temple.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.280]   You can go to an atheist meeting and they'll tell you the same thing.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.640]   You want to be a good human being, be good to your friends, be good to your family.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.080]   That is not what he is saying here.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.920]   He's calling us that and beyond that as he loved us.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.640]   And the Bible tells us that his love was demonstrated in that while we were yet sinners.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.180]   People that we wouldn't normally love, people that we are not naturally motivated to love,
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.900]   people that we would just by second nature keep them at bay.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:40.420]   To practice the kind of love that the world does not practice, if you've ever made any
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:47.440]   attempt to love the way Christ loved, you know that that is the greatest burden.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.840]   It is the most difficult thing to do.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.640]   If you've had any trouble doing quiet time, being disciplined, memorizing Scripture, all
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   of these things at times are hard, keeping pure, all of these things are difficult, but
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   if you've made any attempt to love the way Christ has loved, you know what a tremendous
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.440]   burden that is.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.060]   It can literally suck the life out of you because it is not within us.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.460]   We are not naturally given to love people that are difficult to love.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.680]   As soon as the honeymoon period of any church or any relationship falls apart and we begin
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.760]   to realize just how difficult it is to love sinners, our natural defense mechanism will
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.160]   keep people at bay.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   We don't run to people who are difficult.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.820]   We run away from them.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.160]   So when God calls us to run to difficult people, it is draining.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   It is difficult.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.440]   And this is the very reason why the Scripture says in 1 John 4, 9, "We love because He first
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   loved us."
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.200]   I think it's 19, sorry.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   1 John 4, 19.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   We love because He first loved us.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.440]   You and I, the kind of love that God calls us to practice, it is in response to what
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   He's done for us.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.840]   And that's why even in chapter 12, it says, "In view of this mercy."
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.480]   See even though that may seem like a passing statement or a statement that just kind of
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.280]   connects us to what He's about to say, that's the key.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.920]   The key to every imperative from chapter 12 on is the "therefore," "in view of this mercy."
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.520]   Because the only way that you and I can practice this love is if we have personally been loved
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.560]   by Christ.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.480]   That's why Paul says in Philippians chapter 2, 1-2, he's dealing with a very difficult
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.160]   situation with these two prominent women who are not getting along.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.520]   In fact, it was so difficult.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.400]   In fact, I've realized the study through Philippians this last time as I was going through my quiet
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:56.560]   time, I realized the whole letter is saturated with his concern for this church that's divided.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.640]   And the key reason why it was divided is because of these two ladies.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.680]   So he actually later on begs the church, "Hey, you guys get involved and help these two women
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   to get along."
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.160]   And so I realized so much of what Paul is saying all throughout the letter is really
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.480]   dealing with this issue of division.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.320]   These two prominent ladies who probably love the Lord in this model church, and it is in
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:23.220]   that context where Paul tells them in Philippians 2, 1-2, he says, "If there is any encouragement
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:29.840]   in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.580]   receive my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.360]   and one mind."
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.000]   Before he calls them to unity, he says, "Have you been encouraged by Christ?"
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.020]   Now obviously he's not saying that here's a bunch of Christians and then there's a few
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.120]   of them who've been encouraged, a few of them who've been fueled by the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.240]   He's saying, "No, you're a Christian.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.300]   You're a child of God."
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.720]   So he's not calling out a few extra Christians to follow this principle.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.840]   He's saying, "Those of you who claim to have been encouraged by Christ, been comforted
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:11.640]   by His love, you've participated in the Spirit, and any affection and any sympathy from Christ,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.320]   he's saying, "Practice it.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   Don't just sing about it.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.380]   Don't just memorize the Scripture.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.320]   Don't just recite it to one another.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.680]   Don't just share with one another."
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   Basically what he's saying, "If you're a child of God who's singing about the affections
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:31.360]   of Christ and His unconditional love for you, then you do the same thing as Christ did and
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.720]   have the same mind, have the same spirit."
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.440]   So he's calling us based upon the fuel that God gives us by His love.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.520]   And that's why it's so important for us why corporate worship is the key to our spiritual
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.020]   walk.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.940]   Because if you're not being fueled by the love of Christ, everything else that you do
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.780]   by your own strength will only suffocate you.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:58.700]   It'll only feel like religion, more burden, more things that we need to do.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.600]   So what he is going to tell us here in verses 9 through 21, if we apply that by our own
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.660]   strength, at the end of our study, at the end of five, six weeks, you're going to come
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.980]   out thinking, "That's great in theory."
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.320]   And some of you who've never practiced it may be motivated, and let's try it.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.860]   And then there's a bunch of you who've tried it, and you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.260]   and say, "Yeah, that sounds good on the pulpit."
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.520]   But the reality is that's just not reality.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.220]   That's not just the way it works.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.260]   So that's why, even though we're going to be going through all these imperatives and
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.680]   these commandments, that the key to all of this, the fuel and the energy that's going
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.700]   to fuel all of us is back in chapter 1, chapter 12, when it says, "In view of His mercy."
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.360]   In view of what He has done.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.800]   And it is so important for us why, again, we need to connect over and over again, and
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.200]   why we sing sometimes the same songs with the same lyrics over and over again is because
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.180]   ultimately that's our fuel for why we do what we do.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.460]   So today we're going to be looking at these five imperatives, the five descriptions of
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.620]   biblical love, and then we'll move on to the next ones in the following weeks.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.040]   The first principle He gives us, biblical love must be genuine.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.180]   Biblical love must be genuine.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.340]   He says literally, "Let love be genuine."
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:25.380]   The Greek word behind that is "anor kratos," which again means nothing, but literally it
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.220]   means to not to be hypocrites.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.180]   The first thing He tells us about biblical love that we ought to practice is not to be
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.300]   a hypocrite.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.780]   And some of you guys may know that the word hypocrite was a description of an actor in
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.140]   the time of Christ.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.100]   Today, if somebody was acting, and because of all the budgets that they have, and you
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:54.460]   hear stories of people dressing up as different characters, and whether it's a supernatural,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.100]   you know, superhero or whatever, and they would take half a day putting up makeup, and
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   then they would act that out.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.220]   Well, during the time of Christ, the way they did that was they would dress up, and then
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.860]   they would hide their face behind a mask.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:13.900]   And so these actors who lived in acting out playing somebody else were called hypocrites.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.660]   And so that is the language that is being used, saying that our love must not be hypocritical.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.500]   And this is the way John Stott puts it.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:29.060]   He says, "The church must not turn itself into a stage where our love is being practiced
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.260]   with pretense."
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.100]   First Peter 1.22, it says, "Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:43.020]   for a sincere, brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart."
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:50.180]   Now all of that to say, he's calling us to practice agape, unconditional love.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.940]   Because the kind of love that you and I naturally practice is the kind of love that the rest
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.940]   of the world practices.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.460]   We love because there's something to gain from loving you.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.420]   We love because we expect from you.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:09.260]   And if you've ever received love with strings attached, it's a tremendous burden.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.700]   Somebody might give you a gift, and then immediately you feel burdened because now you've got
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.700]   to pay them back.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.740]   You know they're watching and say, "Well, I gave you this gift, and what are you giving
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.740]   me back?
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.180]   Because if you don't match what they've given, at some point it's going to turn ugly.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.860]   It's going to turn to, 'I love you, I love you, I love you, you jerk.'"
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.400]   Like eventually it turns into that when there are strings attached.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.100]   So the first thing that he calls us to is unconditional love, to love people that are
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.200]   difficult to love, without strings.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.240]   And the reason why he calls us to do that is because this is the kind of love that he
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.920]   loved us with.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.640]   It is not with strings, and it is not burdensome.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.160]   He loved us, not because he thought, "You know what?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.960]   I'm going to save these people, and they're going to all come and worship me, and that's
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.360]   going to be my reward."
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.040]   And I, you know, there's some truth to that.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:13.540]   But how many of you in your salvation have paid God back with your awesome worship?
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:19.680]   How many of you came to God, and now you're living your life, and God is up in heaven
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.960]   saying like, "Thank God I saved him.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   I really needed him for this generation."
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:30.520]   You know, most of us, if we're honest with ourselves, probably wondering, "Why did
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.000]   he save me?"
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.680]   Because you know yourself, and I know myself.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:43.080]   If God did not love us without strings attached, without pretense, without hypocrisy, we wouldn't
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.860]   be able to earn his love.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.060]   We would never be able to pay back his love.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.200]   And so because he loved us without pretense, he calls us, this biblical love, to love without
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.160]   pretense, to love without expectation.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.400]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:04.880]   So it is our nature, it is our calling, it is our duty, and it is our privilege to be
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.640]   the reflection of his love to other people.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.680]   So we love because he first loved us, not because I expect something from you, not because
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:16.320]   I want to transform you from one to something else, but simply because it's an overflow
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.120]   of what he has done for me.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:24.480]   That's the first and probably the most important aspect of biblical love.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.000]   Do we practice this love?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.080]   Or is the love that we practice no different than the world?
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.360]   We practice love, but it may not be biblical love.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.640]   Secondly, biblical love must abhor what is evil.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.480]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.640]   Detest or hate what is wicked or malicious.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.320]   You might be asking, like, you know, we're talking about biblical love, and then all
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.360]   of a sudden we are called to hate something.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:58.760]   See, again, if we're not careful, we may hear, say, "Well, God called us to love," and it's
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   beautiful.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.160]   There's a lot of non-Christians who hear the gospel message as God loved us and he tells
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.560]   us to love, and whether they believe in Jesus or not, that's beautiful.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.760]   If you're an atheist, you're a Buddha, I mean, that's beautiful.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.120]   God's calling a community of people to be sacrificial and love, a community of love.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.200]   God loves, so we love, and then we begin to project what that love is in our own idea.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.320]   You know, one of the biggest frustrations that I have within the church, I would have
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.040]   debates oftentimes with people who say, "You know what?
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.360]   This is what God says," and I say, "Well, what does it say in the Bible?"
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.760]   They say, "It says somewhere in the Bible."
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.280]   They're always quoting the Bible very vaguely, but they can't find it where it is, and they're
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.700]   absolutely convinced it's in the Bible.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.160]   And I'm trying to tell them it's not in the Bible, and that's the problem that we have
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   in our culture.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.200]   We have an illiterate Christian community that kind of heard bits and pieces of different
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.780]   messages, and we've heard that we ought to love one another, but then we start to contextualize
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.480]   what that love means for me.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.200]   And so the love has become relative based upon what is palatable to me, to my generation,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.520]   to my friends, and then, if we're not careful, it has nothing to do with biblical love because
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:16.560]   the biblical love calls us to love unconditionally, but it also calls us to hate what is wicked.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.880]   Love is not, the biblical love is not a blind sentimental affection for anything and everything.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.280]   It must be discerning.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.240]   That's what he means by a poor what is evil.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.120]   In Matthew 6:24, it says, "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.540]   and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other."
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.220]   You cannot serve God and money.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.260]   You cannot serve God and money.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.180]   He doesn't just describe, say, you know, be devoted to God and then ignore these things.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:51.140]   He says, no, our love for God must be so strong that there must be hatred toward these temptations.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:57.460]   Again, in Romans 1:32, he said, "The whole reason why the judgment of God is coming is
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.180]   because they have tolerated and accepted what is wicked."
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.920]   In Romans 1:32, "Though they know God, decree that those who practice such things deserve
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   to die.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:12.120]   They not only do them, but give approval to those who practice them."
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.680]   There are certain things that our generation has been pushing and saying, well, if God
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.960]   is love and you guys actually practice love, how can you possibly say these things about
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.040]   these people?
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   Because they've created in their own mind what love should look like.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.820]   But biblical love calls us to love God righteously and to hate wickedness.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:39.240]   He has called us to practice this love without pretense in the context of people who hate
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.660]   the same things.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.220]   It is not enough for us to love Christ.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.580]   He calls us to hate wickedness.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:56.460]   How much of our lukewarmness at times creeps into our lives and our passion for Christ
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.900]   and the things of Christ creeps into our lives because we justify all kinds of sin in our
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.900]   lives.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:09.980]   Whether it's my life or someone else's life or a good friend's life, and we allow
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:17.660]   it, and we become very comfortable with it, and then bad company corrupts good morals.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:25.140]   David, the author of Psalm 101, he says, "I will not set before my eyes anything that
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   is worthless.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.540]   I hate the work of those who fall away.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.900]   It shall not come to me.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.340]   A perverse heart shall be far from me.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.300]   I will know nothing of evil."
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:41.140]   That sounds a lot like Jonathan Edwards' resolution.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.540]   He is resolved to not look at anything wicked.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.200]   He is resolved not to compromise.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.060]   He is resolved to run from anything evil.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:56.340]   Again, in Matthew 5, 29-30, he says, "To what degree should we hate sin?"
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   He said, "If your eye causes you to sin, what does he tell us to do?
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.340]   Pluck it out."
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.340]   That sounds extreme.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.340]   That sounds violent.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.660]   And then he says, "If your hand causes you to sin, what does he say?
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.260]   To cut it off."
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:16.620]   He's calling us to hate sin to the degree that it's better for us to be maimed and
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.340]   enter the kingdom of heaven because of the consequence of that sin.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.540]   That this is how much God hates sin, because of its consequence.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.660]   That the only remedy for this sin was to send his only begotten son.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:35.340]   Do you think a God who hated sin to that degree would have covered us with the blood of Christ
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.540]   and said, "Well, now since you're covered, now I'm okay with it over here on this side."
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.180]   The same God of the Old Testament who is holy, holy, holy is the same God of the New Testament
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.100]   who is holy, holy, holy.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.860]   And that's why in Hebrews chapter 12, verse 34, it says, "Consider him who endured from
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:57.060]   sinner such hostility against himself so that you may not grow weary or faint-hearted.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.820]   In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.820]   blood."
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.180]   You have not resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:15.020]   How much of our tolerance towards sin is completely unbiblical.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.220]   Is not the practice of love.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.660]   It may be the kind of love that the world practices, but it's not the biblical love
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.620]   that he called us to.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.620]   Not only are we to practice this unconditional love, we are called to practice this unconditional
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:34.420]   love without pretense in the context of people who are also hating wickedness.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.620]   Thirdly, biblical love must hold fast to what is good.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.140]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.140]   In some of your translations, it says to cling or to cleave.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:50.100]   The root word behind this clinging is to be glued.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.540]   To be glued.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.020]   Some of you guys may remember, you know, years ago when super glue first came out.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.380]   First service people told me that that glue still exists, right?
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.140]   Super glue, you know, prior to that, we had Elmer's glue, we had rubber cement, we have
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.860]   other glue, but super glue came out and it was literally super, right?
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.100]   And the way that they had the commercial was they had this construction guy wear this hat
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.220]   and then he would put the super glue and then he would go to maybe the third or fourth floor
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.380]   with a metal beam and he would attach his hat and then he would wear his hat and he
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.740]   would put all his weight on that and he would hang and then it wouldn't break off.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:31.860]   And it was a great commercial, you know, because a glue, that glue was so powerful that his
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.540]   full weight couldn't detach it and super glue, I don't know how strong it was now, but it
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.700]   was the strongest thing that I've ever seen, you know, literally.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.980]   I mean, I think at some point I saw super glue in every family and I don't know about
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.540]   you guys, but everybody I know glued their fingers shut by accident using that glue.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:57.060]   The Bible talks about our clinging to God, not just casually coming to Him because we
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.140]   don't naturally drift toward Him.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.500]   I don't know about you, I don't naturally drift toward Christ.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.100]   I don't wake up in the morning, if I do nothing, at the end of the day I'm praising God.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.460]   That's not what happens.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.060]   My mind, I don't know about you, has a tendency to drift toward the things that are negative.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.980]   You know, I could have ten things going right and one thing going wrong and that one thing
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.300]   is on my mind all day long, all week long.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:27.140]   And next thing I know, my worldview is dictated by what's happening in my heart.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.660]   And my heart naturally does not drift toward God.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.460]   So, to me, quiet time isn't, well I got to do quiet time because that's what a good Christian
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.380]   does and I got to set a good example for the church.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.620]   It's my lifeline.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.940]   Because when I don't saturate my mind with God's Word in the morning, right, and I know
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.540]   some of you say, "Well, it doesn't have to be in the morning."
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.620]   I'm not saying it has to be in the morning.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.980]   I'm not adding to Scripture.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.420]   But I am saying that morning is better.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:58.060]   The reason why I say morning is better is because if your mind is not saturated with
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.260]   the Word of God, you naturally drift toward the things of the world, naturally meditate
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.100]   and focus on the things that causes you to see the world in a different light.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:13.220]   So, I need to have my mind and my heart be dictated in the morning of the things of God
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:18.740]   so that the way I view the world is because of what I'm clinging to.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:25.220]   In 1 Peter 2, 2-3 it says, "Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk that by it
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.820]   you may grow up to salvation.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.500]   If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.260]   All of you guys who have experience or maybe some of you nurses, you know when a child
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.620]   first comes, comes out of the womb, you know, some of them are crying, but you know, some
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.620]   of my kids when they came out of the womb, they were sucking, you know, wanting food.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   And I was amazed.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.060]   Like, who taught him this?
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.580]   You know, in my mind I'm thinking like, did Esther read something to him?
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.100]   Like, how did he know that he needed food?
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.980]   The minute that he comes out of the womb.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.980]   He doesn't know anything.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:09.660]   All of this that God innately put in us, an instinct to live.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.060]   And that child, even from the moment that he is born, knows that he needs food to survive.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.340]   He probably doesn't remember any of it.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.740]   God created us to have an instinct to survive and to live.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.900]   And so, Peter is using that as a description.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.700]   He's not talking about just casually drinking.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.460]   He's not talking about, you know, just, "Oh, and I'm hungry."
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.900]   He's talking as an infant, not as an adult who's had a full meal and, you know, just
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.460]   kind of eating because you're tired of the same food.
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.740]   As an infant longs for this pure spiritual milk that you may grow up to salvation if
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.500]   indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:54.740]   This biblical love that he calls us to, calls us to cling to, to be glued to the things
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.060]   of God.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.140]   You and I cannot, by our own strength, to practice this love that Jesus practiced on
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   us.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.780]   Try that.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.940]   When you're not motivated, when you're not moved, and you're not broken by the love
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.020]   of Christ, try to love somebody.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.680]   Try the love of a sinner.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:19.240]   Try to love somebody who is hurting you just by your pure will.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.720]   You don't have it in you.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.920]   I don't have it in me.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:29.000]   So he calls us to abhor what is evil, to be glued to the things that are good.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.600]   In 2 Timothy 2.22, it says, "So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.240]   love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   Not only are we to cling to what is good, to be glued to what is good, he calls us to
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.880]   do it with other people doing the same thing.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.080]   You know, oftentimes I hear within the church, people will say, "You know, it's hard to
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:56.520]   fellowship with people because nobody is pursuing God, nobody's doing this."
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.720]   And sometimes it can be perceived that way.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.520]   But I really want to encourage you because I hear it so often.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.640]   If that's what you perceive, I challenge you to initiate.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:15.480]   If everybody who perceives that, initiate it, a huge chunk of that problem will be solved.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.360]   Instead of watching, saying, "What's wrong with those people?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.040]   What's wrong with these people?"
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   To resolve to initiate.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.440]   And if that's not the case, "You know what, I initiated and they just seem, they have
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.840]   no interest and they're just kind of doing their own thing, they're resisting," then
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.520]   look for people that you can do it with.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.680]   Really cling yourself, attach yourself with people who you're going to be fed and run
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.080]   this race together with.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.020]   To be committed and to be resolved to deliberately fellowship instead of complaining about the
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.820]   fellowship that you are not getting, be active in pursuing genuine fellowship.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.280]   Cling to what is good, cling to other people who you can do this with.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.760]   In Philippians 4-8 it says, "Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.040]   is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.280]   If there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things."
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.600]   And this is the reason why, again, I encourage you in the morning, be in the Word, even if
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.120]   it's just one verse, to meditate, to cling to, to think about.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.880]   You know the story in the Old Testament about Jacob and Esau.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:33.360]   Jacob and Esau's story, if you understand it without understanding the larger picture,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.440]   makes no sense.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.640]   Because Jacob's the younger brother, Esau's the older brother, he's the manly man going
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   out doing manly things.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.640]   He's hunting, he's bringing back food.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.280]   Jacob, as far as we know, was doing nothing.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.760]   He's sitting with his mommy playing, I don't know what he was doing, but he wasn't out
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.800]   doing what manly men do.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:59.160]   So Esau comes back, he's famished, and Jacob is, you know, he's scheming.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.920]   And he says, "Well, if you give me your birthright, I'll give you my stew."
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.480]   And we can totally understand Esau, right?
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.900]   I mean, he's hungry.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.400]   And this guy is like, "Well, give me your birthright."
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.200]   "Well, what is my birthright right now?
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.120]   I'm going to die because I'm so hungry."
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   Right?
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.040]   A bit dramatic, but we can understand him.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.180]   He's hungry.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:29.360]   And as a result of that exchange, he loses his birthright, him, his children, his grandchildren,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.120]   and for generations to come, he doesn't get his birthright.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.560]   In fact, in Hebrews chapter 12, 16, this is how Esau is described.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.420]   He says that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.760]   for a single meal.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.880]   He doesn't simply say, "Oh, that was a mistake."
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.120]   "Oh, he should have gotten his priorities right."
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:56.560]   He calls what Esau did wicked, unholy, immoral.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:02.040]   What was it about Esau, what did he do that made this action so detestable in the eyes
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   of God?
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:08.760]   You have to understand that this was no normal family, that his grandparents, his parents'
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.520]   grandparents received the covenant of God.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.160]   And his whole reason why his family was where they were doing what they were is because
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:21.640]   God made a promise to his ancestors that, "I'm going to bless you and your children
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.840]   and for many children, and through you, the whole world is going to be blessed."
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.480]   So this was no ordinary inheritance.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.280]   This is not just about cows and farms and land.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.060]   It's about God's promise.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:42.000]   And so at that moment, when he was famished, he weighed the odds and said, "No, I'd
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.480]   rather have the food than this promise of God."
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.520]   What was wicked was not that he didn't see the value of these cows and these goats and
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.080]   these lands.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.720]   He lived for today and not for the promise of God.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:03.760]   How much of the decision-making in our day-to-day life is dictated by our flesh rather than
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.120]   the promise of God?
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:10.600]   How much of our friendship is dictated by who makes us happy today rather than people
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.000]   who are that we're running with for eternal things?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.700]   What he called wicked was he didn't see the value of God's promise.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:26.400]   He sold the covenant promise that was made with his family for a bowl of soup.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:34.200]   And so what Esau did is exactly what he describes in Romans, that they clung to what was wicked
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.640]   and did not recognize God.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:44.340]   So God calls us, this biblical love that he calls us to is unconditional, is agape love.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.320]   We uphold what is evil and we are glued to what is good.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.480]   Fourthly, biblical love must be with brotherly affection.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.200]   There's two words, similar words that is used, love and brotherly affection are both family
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.880]   words.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.920]   It's philo-storge, so some of you guys who know the Greek words behind it, phileo and
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.240]   storge, brotherly love and family love mixed into one word.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.840]   That's the word that's translated for love one another.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.720]   And then as brotherly affection is Philadelphia, again where we brotherly love one another.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.940]   So the fourth principle that he gives us in the way that we practice love, that we practice
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.760]   love to the extent that we would love our family members.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.080]   And that's exactly what we have become.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:32.800]   Jesus himself says on the cross in John 19, 26-27, when Jesus saw his mother and his disciples
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:39.560]   whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son."
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.280]   That his death and crucifixion when we've been adopted to his family, we have all become
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.160]   interconnected as family members.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.720]   And that's why he said, "Behold your son."
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   Then he said to the disciples, "Behold your mother."
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.240]   And from that hour, the disciples took her to his own home.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.840]   They didn't look at Jesus' mother and say, "Well, now your son is gone.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.840]   That's going to be tough luck."
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.400]   He said, "No.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.560]   You've all become family members in the church."
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:10.040]   And I know that it takes some time for us to be sanctified to really be able to see
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.440]   that these aren't just brothers that we just happen to go to the same church.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.000]   That in God's eyes, we are family.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.760]   And that's why Paul says in 1 Timothy 5, 1 and 2, "Do not rebuke an older man, but encourage
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.320]   him as you would a father.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.540]   Treat younger men like brothers, older women like mothers, younger women like sisters.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.360]   In all purity."
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.280]   So the standard in which we ought to be called to love one another is, do we love our brothers
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.000]   and sisters like we love our family members?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.940]   And oftentimes, sometimes, you know, I have to use that standard in the way that I treat
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.480]   maybe the church people.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.640]   And there are times when maybe I may be tempted to do this or tempted to do that.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.080]   You know, even as we carry out church discipline, I have to ask myself, would I do this to my
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   child?
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.880]   Would I do this to my wife?
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:06.320]   And that's the standard that he calls and he says, "Love your neighbors," what?
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.840]   "As yourselves."
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.480]   So the biblical love is unconditional.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   It abhors evil.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   It clings to what is good.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.980]   And it is the standard in which we practice.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.160]   The practical standard we practice is they're our brothers, they're our sisters, they're
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.320]   our uncles.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.040]   We become family members in the body of Christ.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.160]   Fifth and finally, biblical love outdoes one another in showing honor.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.480]   Biblical love outdoes one another in showing honor.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.840]   Philippians 2, 3, "Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.240]   significant than yourselves."
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.880]   Imagine what the church community would look like when we're actually competing with one
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.520]   another to love one another.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:53.120]   And the worldly concept of what it means to be honored is shunned at the door.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.640]   And when we come to church, our greatest passion is to outdo one another in honor.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   How much problems in the church, how much divisions and how much discord in the church
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:11.320]   would just naturally be solved if the brothers and sisters in the church were determined
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.600]   every time they come to honor and love more than ourselves?
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:24.220]   How much of family relationships, even with our children, our friends, coworkers at church,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:29.580]   how much of the discord and the problems that we have is because we're all trying to one
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.720]   up one another, to bypass each other.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.840]   In fact, the passage in 1 Corinthians 13, 1 and 3, I mean, this is a go-to passage because
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.320]   Paul basically is telling this church that this is your main problem.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.160]   You're divided, you have chaos in the church, communion, all of these things are happening
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.080]   because you don't practice love.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.480]   And that's why he says, "If I speak in tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.140]   am noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.080]   He says in application in chapter 14, some of these people were coming out and speaking
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.400]   tongues in public and he said, "Well, it's causing a lot of confusion."
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.080]   And maybe they were saying, "Well, it doesn't matter because I have this freedom to do whatever
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   I want."
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.960]   And he challenges them, "It's better that if you prophecy or if you do things that's
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.280]   going to benefit the church."
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:25.700]   And he says, "So if you practice tongues without love, all it becomes is utterance, it's noise,
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.200]   it doesn't benefit anybody."
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.880]   If you have prophetic powers and have not love, it's nothing.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.440]   And that's exactly what was happening in the Corinthian church in chapter 14.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   People were standing up and saying, "You know, I have a prophetic utterance."
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   And they were all standing up at the same time.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.400]   And then one person would stand up, another person would compete with him, and it was
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.040]   creating all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.400]   Even the way that they were having communion.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.480]   Instead of being concerned about the people who didn't have money, they were coming and
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.060]   said, "Well, you know, we brought this so we should be able to eat this."
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.360]   And it was causing all kinds of problems in the church.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.640]   And he condemns them, saying, "What you are practicing is not communion.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.560]   You are going through the motion.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   You are eating the food.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.040]   You are doing it in the church.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.600]   But it is not communion that you are practicing.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   If it is not in love, it is for nothing."
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.960]   In fact, it says, "Even if you have faith that can move mountains, and if you have not
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.560]   love, it is nothing."
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:26.520]   Do you remember in Acts chapter 9, Philip comes and evangelizes, and this Simon the
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.880]   sorcerer, this magician, he also converts and becomes a Christian.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.960]   Peter and John come and they begin to lay hands and the Holy Spirit begins to fall.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.240]   And Simon watches that and says, "Wow, that would be awesome if I could do that."
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.600]   And he was thinking about probably what he was doing before he became a Christian.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.840]   You know, even as he was practicing maybe fake magic, he has never had that kind of
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   power.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.320]   And all of a sudden he sees it in Peter and John, you know, and says, "Well, how much
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.440]   is this going to cost me?
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.240]   How can I get that?"
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.640]   Peter responds in rebuke and he says to him, "May your money perish with you because
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   you thought you could buy the gift of God with money."
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.000]   You know why we worship God?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.960]   If God wasn't love, you and I wouldn't be here.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:25.160]   If all he was was powerful, if all he was was almighty and omniscient.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:33.640]   We'd be living every single day in terror because he can use that power to squash us
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.240]   and we'd be done.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.800]   He says if God gives us power and faith to move mountains and if it's not in love, it
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.920]   is a destructive power that will be used to squash other people, to glorify himself, to
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.480]   be on the mountain and say, "Look what I've done.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.720]   If you mess with me, this is what's going to happen to you."
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:42:01.160]   He says even if you have the gift of faith to move mountains without love, it's not good.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.320]   It's actually dangerous.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:09.360]   If you have generosity, if you have all the knowledge, you've read all the theological
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:16.520]   books and you're the go-to guy to explain the hypostatic union of Christ and his incarnation
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.600]   and the different hermeneutical principles of dispensationalism, of covenant theology,
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.480]   and you've learned all of these things and you're the PhD and you're writing commentaries
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.000]   and yet you have not love.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.560]   All of that is just a tool to glorify yourself.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.200]   All of that becomes a resource to point out how stupid other people are.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.520]   And all it does is cause divisions in the church.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   And don't get me wrong, all of the things that I mentioned are things that we ought
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.800]   to be pursuing, that we ought to be interested in because it is scripture.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.720]   But he says if you do this without love, it actually does more harm than good.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:43:00.040]   How many churches and how many friendships have been split over non-consequential things
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.880]   because of men who are good at these things?
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.160]   Without love, it means nothing.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.800]   Even generosity, you can give to the poor and without love, it means nothing.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.080]   Evangelism.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.080]   And he says even martyrdom.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:21.400]   If you give your body to be burned and yet have not love, it's nothing because even sacrificing
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.960]   our own body, we can do it to glorify ourselves.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:31.120]   That we can be venerated after we die so that we can have a better place in heaven for whatever
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.080]   the reason he says if it is not out of love, it does no good.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.960]   Love trumps spiritual gifts.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.680]   Love trumps knowledge.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.560]   Love trumps evangelism.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.840]   Love trumps theology.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   Love trumps generosity.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:53.240]   Love trumps everything that we have, even martyrdom.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.540]   So let me go back to our main point.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.120]   How important is it that we practice this?
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.080]   How important is it that as our church, that not just one of many priorities, not just
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:12.620]   one of many disciplines, but it is the discipline.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:17.760]   It is the thing that he has called us to, every single one of us.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.200]   Without it, you don't have a church.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.020]   This is why he came.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   This is why he died.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.280]   This is why we read scripture.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.880]   This is why we pray.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.520]   This is why we evangelize.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.000]   This is why we fellowship.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.360]   This is why we study.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.140]   This is why we worship.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:43.260]   Because when we fell from God, the author of life, this is what we lacked.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.960]   This is what's lacking in our homes.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.460]   This is what's lacking in our friendships.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.340]   This is what's lacking in the world.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:58.700]   So first and foremost, as we, again, that's our first part in biblical, practicing and
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.560]   understanding biblical love.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.080]   My encouragement, and again, you know, we're going to explain this in our members meeting,
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:14.000]   but the theme of our goal this year in 2018 is to live worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.720]   And living worthy just doesn't mean like being good singers and hearing theology and studying
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   the Bible.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.400]   All of these things are great things.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.860]   But in the end, we want to be more than just hearers of the word, but to be doers.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.040]   You can sit here and listen to these sermons, say, "I agree with that."
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.080]   And who wouldn't disagree with it?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.060]   It's beautiful to talk about the love of Christ.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.360]   But if that's where it ends, you said, "Good."
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.040]   But even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.720]   Faith without application is dead.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:51.600]   So our goal this year is to propel, compel one another, sharpen one another, right, to
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.760]   consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.200]   That this love, this biblical love that he's telling us is actually physically being practiced
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.080]   in our church.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.020]   Let's have the praise team come up and take some time to worship.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:10.740]   And again, I really want to encourage you as we talk about this, don't make applications
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.460]   into these big things that you can't really measure and say, "I want to be a better Christian.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.540]   I want to love more."
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.020]   What does that mean practically?
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.340]   What is something specific that you can apply today?
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.740]   What is something specific that you can apply and then you can look back and say, "Well,
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.780]   I did that," you know?
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:30.340]   And to make tangible applications that you can measure and say, "You know, I really want
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:34.980]   to apply this biblical love that God has given me," and to really pray in those lines because
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.380]   that's sort of where we want to take our church this year.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.620]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team guides in these.
