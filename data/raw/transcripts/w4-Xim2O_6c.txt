[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   - I wanna thank all of you who've come
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.100]   so that we can walk through the life of Christ,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.340]   especially that last week.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.100]   As you guys remember, on Sunday,
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.440]   Jesus enters into Jerusalem riding on a donkey
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.600]   and preparing for what he's been telling his disciples
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.940]   that he was gonna do on Friday.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.100]   Monday, he comes into the temple
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.340]   and he cleanses the temple.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.060]   And the cleansing of the temple does two things.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.760]   One, he reminds his disciples how the zeal
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.680]   for his Father's house was gonna consume him,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.400]   meaning the whole reason why Christ came
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.720]   was to restore a broken worship.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.480]   And so it left an impression not only on his disciples,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.100]   but everyone who was there,
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.100]   how important worship was and how important worship is.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.340]   But the other aspect of what the cleansing of the temple did
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.600]   was it agitated the leaders.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.840]   And so if he was going to be crucified,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.360]   and as he said, by the hands of the leaders of Israel,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.400]   he basically made a public statement.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.900]   And he basically challenged them in their home,
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.640]   in their comfort zone, where their power relied on,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.720]   was at the temple.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.480]   And he enters into the temple,
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.000]   and when he flips over the tables,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.060]   he wasn't just flipping over the tables
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.560]   of the people who were taking advantage of that.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.180]   He was basically publicly challenging the leaders
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.940]   for allowing this to happen.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.780]   And so as a result of that, they know exactly where he is.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.620]   And they know where to get him.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.720]   So they've been trying to plan this,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.560]   but for the first time, he's in their territory,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.800]   and this begins a series of events
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.620]   that's going to eventually lead him to the cross.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.760]   Tuesday is a day where he spends teaching his disciples
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.140]   to prepare for what's coming.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.960]   So we could say that this was sort of his last sermon
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.880]   that he gives to his disciples.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.500]   So today, as we gather together and meditate
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.640]   on the steps that Jesus took,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.840]   that we remember that every single thing
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.660]   that Jesus does this week is very purposeful,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.100]   and to prepare all the disciples,
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.800]   prepare everyone who has come, and even us today,
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.640]   as we ready our hearts, that we step through these seats,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.360]   and not just to observe it as something that happened
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.060]   thousands of years ago,
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.280]   but really be able to connect with Christ
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.520]   in the steps that he takes us.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.400]   So imagine what he must have been going through
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.920]   knowing that the crucifixion is coming in just a few days,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.660]   knowing that his disciples that he loves
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.200]   are gonna betray him,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.040]   that people who yelled out "Hosanna"
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.880]   are gonna turn against him,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.000]   and that his own father that he loves so dearly,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.280]   that he's gonna be hanging on the cross and crying out,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.200]   "Why have you forsaken me?"
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.480]   And so, as we follow the footsteps of Christ,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.320]   that we don't, again, just look at the superficial things
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.040]   that are just watching from a distance,
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.800]   but that we would also walk with him,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.980]   you know, in mind, in heart, in footstep,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.560]   so that as we get to the point of the cross,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.000]   that we would have had the whole week to think,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.060]   and step by step to lead us there as Christ did.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.180]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll take time to worship,
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.860]   and then our sister Janelee's gonna come,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.200]   and she's gonna give her testimony,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.440]   and then we'll walk through Jesus's life on Tuesday.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.280]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:32.580]   Gracious Father,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.880]   Lord, when we meditate
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.600]   on how deliberate you are,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.420]   and how deliberate this last week
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.120]   of Jesus's earthly life was,
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.240]   knowing the suffering that is coming,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.880]   how he chose to walk into Jerusalem,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.160]   challenge the leaders,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.780]   prepare his disciples,
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:09.460]   and all the while being worried, Lord God, for us,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.640]   I pray, Father, that you would stir us,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.100]   consume us, revive us,
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.900]   as we walk with you this week.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.680]   Let our praise be from our hearts.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.960]   Let our worship be in spirit and in truth.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.040]   And that your suffering for us
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.840]   would lead us to greater worship,
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.320]   greater obedience, and greater love for you.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.120]   In Jesus's name we pray, amen.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.520]   Let us all rise, let us all rise
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.820]   as we sing these praises.

[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:12.020]   Hi, everybody.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.920]   Hi, Brian family.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.560]   My name is Jenny Lee,
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.160]   and I've been at Brian for the last two and a half years
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.600]   as part of the band ministry.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.280]   And I'm really thankful to be here
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.040]   and to be sharing with you guys
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.800]   and just on what God's been teaching me this past year.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.520]   PPC mentioned on Palm Sunday
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.000]   how Passion Week was one of the most hardest
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.360]   and loneliest week for Christ.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.560]   And that resonated a lot with me
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.200]   because this year has been especially painful.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   I had, because I lost my mom unexpectedly
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.920]   and suddenly, she was also my best friend.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.800]   And so she was 82, but if you met her,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.320]   you would have thought she was a lot younger
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.680]   'cause she had such a vibrant and youthful spirit about her.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.240]   And she would have been one of the funniest people
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.440]   you guys would have met.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.040]   And so I thought in my head, I was like,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.840]   oh, she's gonna live well into her 90s.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.680]   And so I'm thankful that my mom was a believer
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.240]   and that she's celebrating in heaven.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.800]   But my brother and I do kind of struggle a lot with,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.880]   there's so many different feelings of sorrow
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.480]   and doubt and anxiety and fear.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.440]   And while I don't completely understand
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.640]   why things happen so suddenly,
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.600]   God has been encouraging me with three different truths
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.840]   through this loss.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.080]   The first truth is that God indeed loves me
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.760]   and he is my ultimate comforter in this pain.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.360]   There's a lot of, yeah, I was doubting a lot.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.080]   It's like, does God really love me?
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.600]   Am I just a pawn in this game of life?
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.440]   And I was comforted by Matthew 5, 4,
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.000]   which says, "Blessed are those who mourn
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.960]   "for they shall be comforted."
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.400]   And I have been praying this daily
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.080]   for myself and my family.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.760]   And God has answered that so much through you guys.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.440]   I feel like the church family has been such the hands
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.280]   and feet of Jesus during this time.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.960]   When things happened so quickly
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.720]   and we had to plan our celebration,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.560]   yeah, my brother and I and my dad were just so stressed out
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.240]   and everybody was so willing to serve
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.120]   and to just come alongside of us,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.080]   whether it was to help us with taking pictures
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.060]   or help us with money, sound,
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.840]   and just even just showing up.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.800]   And during the week leading, even the whole month,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.320]   everybody wanted to drop us off food.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.160]   So we had massive amounts of food.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.240]   We had all this boba and we had flowers
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.400]   and we had a lot of Korean food, boiling crab.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.120]   And at a certain point, and my dad especially loved
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.920]   the chili cheese fries from Del Taco.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.440]   Ashley, you know who you are.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.880]   But at one point he was like,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.520]   "Can you tell your friends to stop bringing food?
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.720]   "There's too much food."
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   So just really that love that came from you guys
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.680]   is just a reflection of there's Christ's love
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.520]   through you guys.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.920]   I was also encouraged by just all the messages that we got
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   and all the cards and just being so encouraged
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.720]   that you guys are really encouraging me
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.120]   through God's love and God's truth.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.360]   And during our Thessalonian study last year,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.120]   we had memorized this verse
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.760]   and it really came a lot more alive during this time.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.880]   And that's 2 Thessalonians 2.16.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.320]   Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.280]   and God our Father, who loved us,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.920]   comfort your hearts and establish them
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.520]   in every good work and word.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.920]   This verse has comforted me and it's a powerful reminder
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.800]   that during the season, even though the world
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.920]   will throw a lot of trials upon you that you don't expect,
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   I'm strengthened that God, through Jesus Christ,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.440]   he loves me and he has given me eternal comfort
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.880]   that the world can't provide.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.400]   The second thing that God has been encouraging me with
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.520]   is that he has been wanting me to long for heaven.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.880]   When I lost my mom, I had this whole, and I still do,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.120]   this void in my heart.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.040]   And I started thinking a lot more about heaven.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.480]   I was thinking and yeah, I remember talking
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.800]   to Elder James about heaven too, just like,
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.760]   oh, what is heaven like?
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.840]   And what is she doing?
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.400]   I mean, every day I'm like, what is she doing up there?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.960]   And can she hear me?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.480]   And I have to admit, before this happened,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.240]   and we went through Thessalonians Bible study last year,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   that I really didn't have a longing for heaven.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.640]   It was just a very pie in the sky concept for me.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.520]   And it felt like something I knew in my heart,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.560]   but not in my head.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.520]   And so though I don't have all the answers
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   of heaven explained, I definitely long for heaven
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.640]   a lot more and I look forward to being reunited
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   with both Christ and my mom.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.240]   One of the verses that really spoke to me
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   a lot during the season is 1 Corinthians 15, 54 through 57.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.200]   It's kind of long, but it's a really powerful passage.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.480]   And it's, death is swallowed up in victory.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.800]   Oh death, where is your victory?
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.880]   Oh death, where is your sting?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.360]   The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.960]   But thanks be to God who gives us victory
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.460]   through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.600]   I kind of struggle a lot with the concept of death,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.240]   even though we know where we go after we die,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.920]   and even the word funeral, 'cause it just made it sound
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.520]   like death was so final, but it's not.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   You know, these verses have encouraged me
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.000]   that death is definitely a consequence of our sin
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.320]   and the fact that we live in a broken world.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   But as Christians, it's more of a homecoming.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.640]   You know, and so it's, if we believe
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.640]   that Jesus Christ is our Savior,
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.280]   we know that he died for our sins,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.840]   he's given us, my mom and I, victory,
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.560]   all of us victory over death.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.920]   So that's really comforted me and has made me
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.960]   like long for heaven more, that it's a place
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.000]   we should look forward to,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.900]   because that's where our true home is.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.840]   The third truth that God has been teaching me
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.420]   is that as much it is to die is to gain,
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.200]   to be at home with Christ is gain.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.960]   God has also teached me that while I'm living
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.600]   is to live for Christ alone, as Philippians 1:21's mentioned
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.240]   and just to really number my days.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.840]   So there's a lot of thoughts during this time
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.480]   where I was like, do I wanna, yeah,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.240]   do I wanna take a break from work?
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.520]   Do I wanna take a break from ministry or church?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.320]   Do I wanna take a break from people?
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.240]   So there was just so many different thoughts,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.880]   and while there's definitely nothing wrong
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.640]   with taking a break, I was processing with people like,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.160]   well, what's the alternative?
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.240]   I'm gonna just sit by myself and think about myself,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.560]   but instead, God's really strengthened me
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.760]   to continue just to serve and continue to focus
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.800]   on God's calling, and honestly, that's been the strength.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.000]   You guys have really just strengthened me.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.960]   So as much as I feel like, oh, I'm serving,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.760]   you guys are really serving me
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.000]   and really strengthening my faith.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.360]   So that's prevented me from getting into areas
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.240]   like depression or darkness because God's love
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.000]   and light is shown through you guys.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.120]   I just wanted to close with what we've been learning
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.920]   in Bible study.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.600]   I've been trying to memorize these verses,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.760]   but it hasn't been perfect, but 1 Peter 1, 6-7 is,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.640]   in this you rejoice, and what we're rejoicing
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.920]   is the fact that we're born again
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.480]   to a living hope through Christ,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.080]   that even for now, if necessary,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.440]   you have been grieved by various trials
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.080]   so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.840]   which is more precious than gold, which perishes,
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.360]   though it's tested by the fire, may be found to result
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.120]   in praise and glory and honor
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.000]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.560]   So this is something I really want my faith
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.500]   to look like at this time, especially during a time of trial.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.700]   And for those of you guys, if any of you guys
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.160]   are going through various trials,
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.080]   it might look differently from what I've been going through.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.360]   Just be encouraged that God is our comforter
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.580]   and he is our living hope, and because of him,
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.760]   because of the truth that we know,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.280]   that we can live for Christ alone.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.400]   So have a blessed Passion Week, and thanks for listening.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.840]   - Thank you, Denny.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 23,
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.960]   and I'm gonna start from verse 37,
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.620]   and I'm gonna read chapter 24, verses one, two, and three.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:04.260]   And again, as Jenny shared about the sorrow
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.900]   of being separated with her mom,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.220]   the whole point of this Passion Week is to remind us
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.540]   of the hope that we have of the resurrection of Christ.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.220]   And so as we celebrate the resurrection on Sunday,
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:22.220]   we're reminded that even though, and not just Jenny,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.940]   even my wife lost her mom recently,
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.660]   and I know there's quite a few people in our church
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.640]   just within the last year had funerals,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.180]   and even now, some of you guys
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.740]   are going through that right now.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.380]   And the hope that we have in Christ
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.300]   is that Jesus Christ came and died and was resurrected
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.820]   to give us hope that death for Christians is not final,
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.820]   that in the end, we will be reunited with our loved ones
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.020]   because of the blood of Christ.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.460]   So again, it's a very fitting testimony for us this evening
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.460]   to remind us of what it is that we are celebrating.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.060]   If you can read with me verse 37,
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.220]   and I'll read, you guys can just follow.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.300]   Chapter 23, verse 37.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.960]   Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.620]   those who are sent to her?
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.940]   How often I wanted to gather your children together
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.960]   the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.940]   and you were unwilling.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.140]   Behold, your house is being left to you desolate,
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.700]   for I say to you, from now on,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.900]   you will not see me until you say,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.700]   blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.100]   Jesus came out from the temple and was going away
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.460]   when his disciples came up to point out to the temple
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.540]   building to him, and he said to them,
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.300]   do you not see all these things?
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.940]   Truly, I say to you, not one stone here
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.660]   will be left upon another which will not be torn down.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.300]   As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives,
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.180]   his disciples came to him privately saying,
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.500]   tell us when will these things happen
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.380]   and what will be the sign of your coming
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.140]   and of the end of the age?
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.980]   Let's pray.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.700]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.660]   Help us to glean from your word
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:04.180]   the last sermon that Christ gave to his disciples
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.660]   that our life, our mind, our heart may belong to you
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.580]   and to you alone.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.500]   You know, I often, and I think this is true of most pastors,
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.820]   and the older I get, the more prominent that this thought is
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.220]   if I had one last sermon to give, what would I preach?
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.580]   If I had that opportunity, if I knew for sure
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.340]   that this would be the last sermon.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.780]   And I could think of many things,
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.740]   but at this point I'm not exactly sure.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.660]   My father, who passed away about 17 years ago,
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.020]   had an opportunity to go back to Korea
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.020]   and to give his last sermon.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.020]   And we knew it would be his last sermon.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.980]   The doctor actually told him that if you make this trip
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.740]   that you may not be able to come back.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.940]   And this is the church that he planted when he was young.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.620]   And so the church was going through, I think,
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.500]   the 30th or 40th anniversary,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.860]   and they invited him to come and speak,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.540]   but he fell so ill that even just walking across the street
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.380]   he would faint because he didn't have enough oxygen.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.540]   So the doctor told him that if you take this trip
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.820]   you may not be able to come back.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.740]   And so obviously we're telling him
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.900]   this is too dangerous, you can't go.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.620]   But I remember my father,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.540]   because this was a church that he planted
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.180]   in so much of our childhood,
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.180]   and when he was young, ministry was there.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.100]   That was the beginning of his ministry.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.900]   And so he said, "Even if I die, I want to go."
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:42.740]   And so packed up his bags, and I think it was Phillip
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.300]   who basically took him there and had to kind of
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.100]   wheelchair him around.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.240]   And I didn't know how he was going to preach
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.520]   because he was barely able to stay standing for a while,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.380]   but somehow he made it, and then he got up on the pulpit.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.340]   And while he was on the pulpit, you could never tell.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.420]   And so he gave his last sermon,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.740]   and sure enough, when he came back, his health failed him.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.580]   And I think within a year, a year and a half of that,
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.100]   he passed.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.340]   But he was so determined, and we could not stop him
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.980]   because we knew that this was so important to him,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.140]   that knowing that he was going back to the church
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.060]   that he planted, and a lot of the people who were there,
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.620]   especially some of the older ones
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.300]   or the ones who invited him, he worked together with,
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.220]   and so some of the closest people that he knew
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.620]   were at that church.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.300]   And so he wanted to give that message.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:37.900]   Well, today, Tuesday, is where Jesus is giving
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.160]   his final discourse to his disciples.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.700]   So you can imagine, there is not a single thing
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.440]   that Jesus said that was not important.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.840]   It's inerrant word of God.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.020]   But imagine if you know that what you've been preparing
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.600]   to do is just a few days away,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.340]   and that he's been warning them and telling them
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.080]   and preparing them that where I go, you cannot come.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.160]   The Holy Spirit's gonna come,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.200]   remind you of everything that I said,
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.600]   but as far as my physical presence,
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.200]   I'm going to head toward the cross,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.020]   and soon after that, I'm gonna be gone.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.400]   So you can imagine that the final time
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.300]   that he has with his disciples is well calculated,
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.320]   that everything he says here is knowing
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   that he's going to leave his loved ones,
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.640]   and there is trouble coming for them,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.960]   and so he needed to make sure that they knew
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   what he wanted them to know before he went.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.600]   And so that's the Olivet Discourse,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.260]   where Jesus sits with his disciples.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.440]   He is a bit removed from the temple,
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.360]   and he's looking down at Jerusalem,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.400]   saying, "In a few days, that's where I'm headed."
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.200]   And so he tells them, and so the primary thing
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.800]   that he says in Matthew chapter 24,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.040]   as he gives the Olivet Discourse,
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.440]   the first part of it and the major part
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.120]   of his last part of Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.120]   is a warning against the trials that's coming.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:07.000]   So obviously, this was heavily on Jesus' heart,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.800]   that after he leaves, that the wolves are going to come
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.640]   and try to deceive them.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.160]   So Matthew chapter 24, four through six, he says,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   "See to it that no one misleads you,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.980]   "for many will come in my name,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.540]   "saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.560]   "You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars,
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.920]   "so that you are not frightened,
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.900]   "for those things must take place,
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.320]   "but that is not yet the end."
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.160]   So he tells them, "The primary attack
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.860]   "that you're gonna get are people
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.120]   "who are going to represent me,
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.240]   "are going to lead you astray."
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.220]   And so he's telling them to pay attention,
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.480]   because the primary attack of Antichrist
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.280]   is to come as an angel of light,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.040]   representing Christ, quoting scripture,
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.080]   saying that they are a servant of Christ,
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.740]   and they will mislead you.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.220]   So stay sober, Matthew 24, 24 to 26,
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.840]   "For false christs and false prophets will arise
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.600]   "and will show great signs and wonders,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.920]   "so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect."
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.600]   Meaning that this delusion is going to be so powerful,
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.420]   that even the people who grew up in the church,
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.240]   even the people who went to seminary,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.040]   even the people who led Bible studies,
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.400]   even the people who may be preaching on a regular basis,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.080]   that they may lead you astray,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.400]   and they may be led astray, even the elect, if possible.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.340]   He said, "Behold, I have told you in advance,
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.280]   "so if they say to you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,'
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.760]   "do not go out, or 'Behold, he is in the inner rooms,'
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.440]   "do not believe them."
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.360]   Again, I'm not picking and choosing certain verses
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.800]   in at the last days.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.380]   This was his final discourse to his disciples.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.140]   And you can tell that this is weighing on Jesus' heart,
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.800]   that after he leaves, that this is what they're going to face.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.880]   They're going to come, they're going to deceive you,
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.320]   they're gonna be quoting me, that it's not going to be me.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.560]   They're gonna be telling you that this is from me,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.460]   but it's not going to be me, so pay attention.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:14.400]   You know, when Jesus went to the temple,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.240]   obviously the Pharisees and Sadducees are agitated,
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.400]   so they come to him.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.100]   "By what authority do you do this?
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.700]   "How dare you come into our house?
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.680]   "Who are you?"
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.360]   Jesus turns the table around, and he tells them,
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.160]   knowing exactly what's in their heart,
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.900]   "Well, I'll answer your question if you answer me."
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.100]   Who is John the Baptist?
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.060]   Was he from God, or was he from earth?
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.300]   They couldn't answer him that question,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.500]   because they knew it was a loaded question,
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.260]   that if they said that he wasn't from God,
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.480]   he knew that the mobs would turn against him
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.560]   because he was such a popular prophet.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.740]   But if they say, "Well, he must have been from God,"
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.180]   then why were you so against him?
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.980]   So they couldn't answer, and they silenced,
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.220]   Jesus turns the table on them, silenced them,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.280]   because they were not concerned about truth.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.080]   They were concerned about their own position.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.980]   And so Jesus turns around, and not only does he
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.000]   challenge them at the temple, he turns around,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.640]   and the harshest rebuke that we see in the Bible
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   happens as he is exiting the temple.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.280]   He gives the eight woes that you probably
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.600]   have heard before, eight woes that he gives
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.960]   to the leaders of Israel.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.560]   And I'm just gonna highlight just a few of them,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.160]   because it captures the concerns that he had
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.320]   for the leaders of Israel.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.800]   Matthew 23, 13, it says, "Bow to you,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.240]   "scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites,
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.940]   "because you shut off the kingdom of heaven
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.120]   "from people, for you do not enter in yourselves,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.540]   "nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.340]   You're gonna see that term, scribes and Pharisees
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.120]   and hypocrites, repeated over and over again.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.080]   As much as he was concerned about Israel,
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.140]   he was primarily concerned about the leaders.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.440]   And this is not unique to this time.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.560]   Every time Israel fell away from God,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.760]   it was the leaders that led them astray.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.520]   So the warning is, in particular to the scribes
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.160]   and the Pharisees, because they were the spiritual leaders,
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.000]   because they were presenting godliness
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.520]   without true godliness.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.120]   They were acting like they were holy
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.640]   without truly being holy.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.340]   They were talking about grace without knowing grace.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.560]   Matthew 23, 25, "Bow to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   "you hypocrites, for you clean the outside of the cup
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.420]   "and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.040]   "and self-indulgence."
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.840]   Now obviously, as a leader in a church,
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.840]   all of these things, first and foremost,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.200]   is shooting at me.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.440]   And it's a warning against everyone else
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   who's in leadership.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.640]   Because the health of the church
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.980]   depends on the leadership's integrity.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.240]   The health of the church depends on the holiness
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.180]   of the leadership.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.800]   And the love of Christ of the leadership.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.500]   And the reason why I share all of this
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.860]   is because we need your prayers.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.720]   Don't let us get away with hypocrisy.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.800]   If you see hypocrisy in our lives,
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   don't shrug it underneath the table or underneath the rug.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.400]   Because the primary rebuke comes to the leadership.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.760]   That's why it says not many of you should strive
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.960]   to be leaders, because there will be stricter judgment
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.120]   against the leadership.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.460]   I believe that the church as a whole
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.000]   is in the condition that it is today
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.640]   because of leadership.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.080]   And so he rebukes them.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.920]   He tells the disciples, the people who are
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.960]   in the position of leadership,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.120]   listen to what they say, but do not do what they do.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.280]   Matthew 23, 27, 28, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.800]   "hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.720]   "which on the outside appear beautiful,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.800]   "but inside they are full of dead men's bones
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.000]   "and all uncleanness."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.520]   So you too outwardly appear righteous to men,
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.980]   but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:36.880]   Matthew 23, 12, "Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.920]   "and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted."
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.520]   The primary hypocrisy of leadership
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.440]   was that they wanted to be leaders.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.380]   They wanted to be seen.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.620]   They wanted the honor.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.060]   They wanted to be ahead and to be respected.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.100]   They were more concerned about their reputation
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.840]   than they were about righteousness
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.440]   and truth of the word of God.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.540]   And so as Jesus looks at Jerusalem,
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.100]   first and foremost, what he is frustrated with
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.040]   is the leadership of Israel.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.980]   That though they stand in a place
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.940]   to represent the holy God,
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.500]   it's because of the leadership
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.680]   that people were going astray.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.260]   So he warns his disciples, first and foremost, watch out.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:31.080]   It is not safe for us to quote leaders.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:37.100]   It is not safe for us to gain our theology from leadership.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.300]   That I follow this guy, I follow that guy.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.160]   And we're not saying that we shouldn't honor men
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.580]   that we respect, but they are not the heralder of truth.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   The word of God is.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.300]   We need to be in the habit of quoting scripture.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.860]   We need to be in the habit of having our confidence
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.820]   coming from the word of God that we're wrestling with.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.540]   Not simply because some man that we respect
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.140]   has quoted this because that's exactly
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.340]   the beginning of the fall.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.420]   If we put our confidence in men,
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.460]   no matter who they are,
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.760]   no matter what their track record may be.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.740]   No man is safe from hypocrisy.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.940]   No man should be standing in the place
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.980]   where only Christ should stand.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.580]   And so he tells his disciples to be careful.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.840]   But along with that, he tells them,
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.020]   and he warns them to prepare them
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.180]   for the tribulations that are coming.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.500]   To give them hope in the midst of tribulation.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.660]   He's telling them that after I leave,
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.340]   wolves are going to come,
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.700]   and hard time is gonna come your way.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.220]   It's gonna come to them directly as soon as he leaves,
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.500]   but there's also going to be the hardship
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.500]   that's going to come right before he comes.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.100]   So he says in Matthew 24, 29, 31,
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.040]   but immediately after the tribulation of those days,
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.120]   the sun will be darkened,
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.740]   and the moon will not give its light,
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.380]   and the stars will fall from the sky,
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.100]   and the powers of the heavens will be shaken,
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.780]   and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.260]   and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.540]   and they will see the Son of Man
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.780]   coming in the clouds of the sky
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.020]   with power and great glory.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.260]   Now how is that an encouragement?
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.120]   When he says persecution, pestilence, war is coming,
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.040]   it's an encouragement because he says
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.860]   when you see that happening, you know Christ is near.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:29.320]   Just like when suffering comes,
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   nothing causes us to desire Christ more
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.080]   than when we are in the midst of suffering.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.380]   When the world goes into haywire,
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.140]   and it is out of whack,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.580]   and the world is trying to figure out
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.880]   where's the answer to this,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.000]   it's a reminder to us that Christ is near.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.480]   When we are mourning, and we are hurting,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.700]   and we are crying, and we are scared,
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.040]   he said remember, Christ is near.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.720]   That's what he was trying to remind them,
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.120]   that you're gonna experience this,
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.960]   they're gonna hate you because of me.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.420]   They might wanna crucify you because of me,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.280]   but know that I am near, I am coming.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.200]   First Thessalonians 5, 9 through 11,
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.240]   for God has not destined us for wrath,
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.800]   but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.440]   who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep,
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.040]   we might live with him.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.400]   Therefore encourage one another,
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.120]   and build one another just as you are doing.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.420]   Remind each other in times of suffering.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.820]   This is the reason why this week is so important to us.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:38.560]   You know we tend to suffer alone at home,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.120]   and then we tend to come to church,
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.280]   and party, and rejoice, and laugh together.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.660]   But there's not a single person in here,
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.340]   maybe even this week, but for sure this year,
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.800]   for sure in the last couple years,
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.840]   I know that there's not a single person in this room
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.840]   who has not wept privately because of some sort of pain.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:08.200]   You may have lost somebody, may have been rejected,
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.920]   had relational problems, maybe with children,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.600]   whatever it may be, living in this fallen world,
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.620]   we all experience some sort of suffering,
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.480]   some sort of hardship, every single one of us.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.100]   Jesus is reminding his disciples,
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.640]   though he is talking about the specific tribulation,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.400]   it's a reminder to us when suffering comes,
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.300]   that he is near.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.320]   This is the exact reason why he came,
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.920]   to wipe away our tears, to remind us
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.000]   that because of what Christ has done,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.400]   that he went to prepare a place for us,
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.960]   that all the crying, and there may be more crying,
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.800]   and more weeping, and more sorrow ahead of us,
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.560]   but all of that in the midst of all the pain,
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.200]   remember Jesus' words, I am coming, I am coming.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:01.080]   Third and finally, he teaches them about a second coming
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.340]   so that we may live whatever time that we have left here
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.480]   in soberness.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.260]   He gives a parable of the virgins,
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.100]   five of them who weren't prepared,
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.100]   living their life like everybody else,
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.580]   and the other five who had the oil ready,
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:21.560]   but when the bridegroom came, the five were ready,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.540]   and so they came in, and then the five others did not.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.260]   And then he gives a parable of the five talents,
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.820]   the five, and the two, and the one,
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.300]   where they were diligent in using,
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.900]   being ready for the master to come
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.380]   so that they can present what they have done,
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.860]   and warned them not to be like that one talent,
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.060]   and he just buries it and say,
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.060]   well, I'll just wait until he comes.
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:49.180]   And so he tells them, because he is coming,
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.400]   live as if he is coming.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.420]   Don't live like you're gonna be here forever,
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.660]   'cause we're not.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.440]   Don't live here and act, and make decisions,
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.080]   and invest, and pursue, like you're gonna be here forever,
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.020]   'cause you're not, you know you're not.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.560]   But Jesus' last teaching to his disciples
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.360]   is to remind them, I am coming.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.900]   It may not be tomorrow, it may not be the next day,
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.060]   but I am coming.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.900]   And when he comes, to be prepared.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.520]   First John 3, two to three, it says,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.620]   beloved, we are God's children now,
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.900]   and what we will be has not yet appeared,
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.820]   but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him,
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.460]   because we shall see him as he is,
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.260]   and everyone who thus hopes in him
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.960]   puts himself as he is pure.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.940]   You know, as Jenny was sharing,
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.100]   and I think it was very appropriate,
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.180]   now she said that heaven didn't seem that real.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.980]   It's not because she didn't believe it.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.740]   It's not because she looked at it and said,
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.300]   I don't believe heaven, but it just didn't seem real
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.380]   until she suffered the loss of her mom.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:05.180]   And so the blessing of the sorrow
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.980]   of being separated from a loved one
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.640]   is a reminder to us to be sober that he is coming,
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.900]   that heaven is real,
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.060]   that one day we will be reunited,
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.500]   not only with our loved ones, but with Christ himself.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.740]   And so to live to prepare,
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.580]   as if we only have one more year.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.320]   Talk to your friends
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.820]   as if that may be your last time you talk to them.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.340]   You don't know.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.420]   This may be the last Easter that you may have
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.320]   an opportunity to share with a non-Christian in your life.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.460]   Approach it like it may be,
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.620]   not thinking, maybe I have another 20,
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.100]   maybe I can ask another 30 years from now,
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.760]   maybe 50 years from now.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.600]   You never know.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:59.540]   I remember, and I've shared this story before,
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:03.620]   but in the years ago, there was a young guy
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.140]   who came to church and he fell away from faith
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.420]   all throughout college.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.700]   And he just graduated UC San Diego,
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.260]   and then he was just starting to
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.580]   show interest again in Christianity.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.140]   But he wasn't just interested in Christianity,
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.060]   he was kind of poking at Christianity, Buddhism.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.140]   But his heart was starting to move toward Christianity,
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.140]   so he showed up to church,
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.500]   and again, this is a very early part of our church,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.140]   and he said, "Pastor Peter, can I meet with you
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.300]   "when I come back next week?"
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.740]   'Cause I'm planning to come back,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.780]   'cause I have a lot of questions to ask you.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.220]   And so I was so excited that this guy,
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.620]   he's returning back to faith,
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.600]   and I had plans and cleared my schedule after Sunday
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.700]   to meet with him on a regular basis,
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.460]   and I show up the next Sunday and he's not there.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.820]   I said, "Oh, he seems so excited, I wonder what happened."
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.540]   And so I contacted his friend to see what happened
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.420]   and found his friend crying,
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.860]   and I asked, "So what happened?"
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.500]   And he said he went out to party
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.080]   the night before on Saturday.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.020]   And him and his younger brother went clubbing
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.840]   and got drunk, and on the way back home,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.380]   he didn't wear his seatbelt,
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.980]   and literally, the exit that he was supposed to go off
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.100]   to go to his house,
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.500]   he didn't make the turn that he was supposed to make,
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.540]   and the car flipped over,
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.420]   and because he wasn't wearing his seatbelt,
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.180]   he flew out of the car.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:34.220]   His younger brother went home,
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.660]   didn't find his brother there,
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   so after a couple hours, he came back looking for him,
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.100]   found his brother's car flipped over
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:40.940]   on the side of the road,
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:44.380]   and his brother another 100 yards from there,
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.180]   and he passed away.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.460]   And so they were telling me
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.560]   that's why he couldn't make it that Sunday.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.780]   And he was just starting his life,
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.020]   23-year-old, 22-year-old young man.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.740]   And I remember going to his funeral
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.400]   and listening to his father give the eulogy.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.940]   And you know what his father said at his eulogy?
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.080]   And his father wasn't a Christian.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.580]   And at the eulogy, his father said,
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.500]   "Don't be stupid like my son."
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.820]   That was his eulogy.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.760]   He looked at his son's friends.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.000]   "Don't live your life like an idiot like my son.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.640]   "Don't do something stupid like my son."
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.480]   That's all he said, and he sat down.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:35.360]   And I remember thinking, just gut-wrenching.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.780]   We truly don't know how long we have.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.580]   And I don't say this to scare you,
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.980]   but that's the reality.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.860]   Our life is fragile.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.020]   We don't know how long we're gonna be here.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.540]   We don't know, the loved ones that surround us,
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:54.580]   how long they're gonna be here.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.340]   I can tell you stories after stories of people
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.780]   that you would have never thought just lie down
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.620]   to take a nap and never woke up.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.460]   We don't know.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.260]   But the danger that we have is,
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.700]   especially when we're young,
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.500]   we have a tendency to think that all our plans
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.500]   are gonna come true.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.460]   And we get shocked when it doesn't.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.220]   But you live long enough,
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:24.940]   and life teaches you this life is short.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.620]   Whether we have one year or 50 years,
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.580]   Jesus is reminding his disciples,
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.460]   "I'm coming.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.620]   "Live like I'm coming.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.260]   "Don't just say it with your mouth.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.620]   "Live like I'm coming."
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:47.620]   Colossians 3, 4, 1 through 4, let me finish with this.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.220]   If then you have been raised with Christ,
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.360]   seek the things that are above where Christ is,
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.460]   seated at the right hand of God.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.360]   Set your minds on the things that are above,
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.620]   not on the things that are on the earth.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.820]   For you have died, and your life is hidden
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:00.780]   with Christ in God.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.900]   When Christ, who is your life, appears,
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.220]   then you also will appear with him in glory.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.660]   As we walk with Christ in the last day of his life,
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   and obviously, you guys have made it a priority
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:18.660]   this week to come and walk along with Christ in each day.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   Sometimes the way we practice our faith doesn't seem real.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.440]   The gravity of what we sing about,
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.400]   the gravity of what we preach,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:37.280]   the gravity of sin and hell is taken too lightly.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.000]   All of us.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.040]   Don't live in such a way that if we died tomorrow,
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.280]   that we would regret it.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.520]   That we would all, every single one of us,
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.420]   we have a tendency to be distracted.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.860]   And part of the reason why we're making a big deal
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.940]   of this week, it's not just this week,
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.560]   but especially this week,
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.400]   that at least, at least this week,
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.820]   that we would take some time to understand
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.100]   the gravity of what Christ has done.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:19.780]   So that our response in view of this mercy
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.240]   will be a reasonable response.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.820]   To what he has done.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.740]   That our worship would be reasonable.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.600]   That our decisions may be reasonable.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.060]   That our value may be reasonable.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.700]   Our pursuits may be reasonable.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.880]   Our fellowship may be reasonable.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.260]   That our life may be lived in reasonable response
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.460]   to the gravity of what he has done for us.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.340]   Let's pray.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.780]   (pastor sighing)
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.960]   Let's take some time to reflect
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.120]   on Jesus' words this last week.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.560]   On Pastor Peter's encouragement on Sunday,
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.780]   Pastor Mark's encouragement yesterday,
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:10.040]   and Jesus' last words of encouragement and warning.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.400]   Take some time to understand the gravity
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.280]   of what he has done,
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.000]   and what he will do on Friday.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.920]   That God will bring true revival.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.640]   That our faith may be strengthened
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.560]   as we come before the Lord.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.000]   Let's take some time to pray.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.480]   (gentle piano music)
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.400]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.320]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.240]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.160]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.080]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.000]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.920]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.840]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.760]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:30.840]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.760]   (gentle piano music continues)

[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.680]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:22.420]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.240]   (gentle piano music continues)
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:42.420]   Lord of every age.

[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.520]   - Let's pray.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:52.720]   Father, as we remember each day of the agonizing walk of Christ
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:59.960]   in these last days, Lord, we pray for revival.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:19.800]   Lord, I confess we have become so comfortable, Lord, even to pray for revival.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:27.760]   The fear, Lord God, comes upon me, not knowing what You will do to bring this revival, not
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:36.520]   wanting You to examine every part of my life.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:50.440]   Lord, as You warned us to remember the height from which we have fallen, to repent and do
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:56.800]   the things that we did at first, Lord, we're gathered here, Father God, because we are
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:11.680]   weak, because without Your Spirit's conviction and help and courage and faith, we can't just
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:21.240]   by our sheer will bring revival in our own hearts, to soften hardened hearts.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:30.360]   I pray that each night we come and meditate and cry out to You, help us, Lord God, to
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:36.800]   have a greater vision of who Jesus is, that the reality, Lord God, of Your second coming
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.400]   would be more and more real to us, so that we would not place our hope here, we would
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:51.880]   not place our hope in our marriages, in our children, in our future, our jobs, our bank
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:10:01.680]   account, but we would live, Lord God, knowing that all this one day will disappear and all
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.960]   that will remain, Lord God, are the things that You have ordained.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.400]   I pray that You would help us to see these things more clearly through this week, that
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:25.500]   as Christ suffers on the cross, that we would not be indifferent, that we would cry out,
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:37.740]   that we would fellowship in His pain, that we would walk in His shoes, and to know that
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:41.180]   He did all of that for me.
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.820]   I pray that that reality would become real this week.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:55.260]   So we pray, Father God, You would help us, revive us, renew us.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:01.140]   May Christ's name and His name alone be adored this week.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:09.100]   Amen.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.380]   nothing at all.
