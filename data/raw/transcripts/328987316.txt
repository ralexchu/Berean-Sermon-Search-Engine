[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Turn with me to Haggai. It's toward the middle and I believe it's gonna be up here on the
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.480]   screen for you. We're gonna read chapter 1 verses 1 through 7. Can we put the put
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.840]   it up on the screen? In the second year of Darius the king on the first day of
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.320]   the sixth month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.960]   the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehoshaddak, the
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   high priest, saying, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'This people says, 'The time has not
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   come, even the time for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt.' Then the word of the
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.800]   Lord came by Haggai, the prophet, saying, 'Is it time for you yourselves to dwell
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.120]   in your paneled houses while this house lies desolate? Now therefore, thus says
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.440]   the Lord of hosts, 'Consider your ways. You have so much but harvest little. You eat
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.240]   but there is not enough to be satisfied. You drink but there is not enough to
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.040]   become drunk. You put on clothing but no one is warm enough. And he who earns
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.520]   earns wages to put into a purse with holes. Thus says the Lord of hosts,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.000]   'Consider your ways.'" Would you please pray with me? Truly speak, O Lord, for
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.040]   your servants are listening. And we pray, God, that you would help us to hear what
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.760]   you have to say and supply the things that we learn to our lives accordingly.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.500]   Help us also, Lord, like the people that we will read about today, to obey the
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.320]   voice of the Lord so that you will receive the glory that you do. We thank
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.160]   you for the freedom to worship together and gather together as a family. We pray
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.920]   for your help to have attentive ears, especially as the context is very
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.200]   different from what we often read about or pray about. So we thank you for this
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   opportunity to study your Word together. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.120]   Earlier this year, our church started a sermon series in the book of Hebrews and
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.560]   many of the sermons have been focusing on the theme of drifting from the faith.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.360]   And coincidentally, each of our departments at church has also studied,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.440]   discussed, and reflected on this theme to varying degrees. We've been strategizing
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.800]   and praying over how to stay anchored and how not to drift. And for all of us,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.520]   this is actually a very important topic. This is an absolutely important topic
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.800]   because if you've been a Christian for any length of time, you know how our
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.400]   hearts are so prone to wander and how naturally and easily we drift. It's not
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.280]   difficult to start out with a bang. We may start out in a flurry, but sometimes
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   as you and I get distracted by our day-to-day lives, God starts moving down
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   on our priority list. And I'm sure you can relate, as I can. This is very common.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   And there's nothing new under the sun. The people of God have always easily
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.280]   gotten sidetracked. So here in the book of Haggai, we're looking at a very major
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   event, one of the biggest events in Jewish history, and we see how the Jews,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.160]   the chosen people of God, find themselves entangled, frustrated, discouraged, and
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.800]   sidetracked. So in these first seven verses that I just read of this short
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.600]   verse or a short book, we read, "Consider your ways twice." Two times through this
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.760]   prophet Haggai, God says, "You guys had one job to do. Have you forgotten your
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.580]   purpose? Have you forgotten me? Consider your ways and get back to work." God shows
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.480]   up and says that. The book of Haggai is a very short book, just 38 verses. If you
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.440]   want to start memorizing books of the Bible, this is a good place to start.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.640]   It's relatively painless. But it is a supremely important book, and I
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.080]   believe that there's much that you and I can learn even from a quick study of it.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   And that's what I would like to do together today. And I want to walk you
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.760]   through the historical background to help us better understand what the Jews
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.480]   are supposed to do and why God comes and says, "Consider your ways." If you're
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.280]   taking notes, I want to outline today's sermon by exploring four questions that
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.560]   we will be thinking through as we examine this short book. First, what is
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.040]   the historical context or background of this short book? Two, who are the
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:53.720]   recipients? Three, why was Haggai written? And four, how are the people of God to
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.360]   respond? And we're actually going to see how all of this applies to us living in
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.360]   the 21st century America here in Orange County. And all of the important points
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.000]   today and the historical facts and stuff are on the church app, okay? So you
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.720]   actually don't need to, like, scramble to write down everything. They're all on
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.320]   there for you, so you can just kind of follow along with your eyes and your ear.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.960]   So first, what is the historical context and background of this short book? Verse
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.200]   one, I'll read it again for you. "In the second year of Darius the king, on the
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai to
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.840]   Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.840]   of Jehozadok, the high priest, saying..." So the book of Haggai and Zechariah are
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.680]   very important books of prophecy. They're contemporaries. They're speaking to the
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.400]   same people. And the historical context of these two books is found in Ezra's
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.320]   chapter 1 through 6. And I'm going to be walking you also through some details in
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.240]   the book of Ezra, okay? So you got to pay close attention. So I'm putting up some
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.160]   dates and some facts that you can kind of track along with. 612 is a very
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.760]   historically significant year. Babylon overthrows Assyria and takes over as the
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.520]   major world power. And this spells great trouble for the people of Judah. So 612
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.960]   is important. Try and memorize that, okay? And in 606, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.040]   Babylon, turns his attention to Jerusalem, the capital of Judah. And then Jerusalem
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.920]   is soon defeated, besieged, and conquered. And under Nebuchadnezzar, the ruthless
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.680]   and very pagan king, the people of Judah are stripped of everything. As the
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.840]   Babylonians start displacing and exiling the people and separating family members
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.400]   from one another, the people of Judah find themselves that they've lost their
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.040]   homes, they've lost their loved ones, their armies are massacred, and the once
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:10.160]   mighty, powerful nation now has zero military power. So they no longer had a
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.280]   country or land. And from that point on, the people are called the Jews, meaning
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.140]   those from Judah, because they needed to be identified somehow, since they were no
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.160]   longer a nation. So historically, this is where they start being called the Jews.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.240]   So if you actually are flipping through your Bibles and you don't ever see the
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.040]   word "Jew" in the first half of the Old Testament, this is why. "Jews" means those
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.240]   of Judah, now that they don't have a land. Okay? So they had no land, no power, no
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.280]   wealth, and they are now slaves to a pagan nation, and they hated it. And then
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:56.920]   in 586, the people of Judah suffered the most devastating, most traumatic, most
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.360]   pain-filled event in the nation's history. And the book of Lamentations
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   describes the pain. The Jews foolishly plot a rebellion, and it fails. And in a
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.720]   rage, Nebuchadnezzar destroys the temple that Solomon had built. Now this temple
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.280]   of God is very important. The temple was the center for the worship of God
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   and the dwelling place of the Most High God. You have a visual home of God. And
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.480]   they see it destroyed. So this could not have but crushed all hope for the people
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.080]   of God. So it seemed now that God had either rejected his people or was not
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.240]   all that powerful. And then for the next 70 years, most Jews are taken into
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   captivity, and the land formerly known as Jerusalem became a wild land
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:03.880]   inhabited by beasts, the poor and the diseased, and various nomadic tribes. And
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.520]   then for the next 50 years or so, there is almost complete biblical silence
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.360]   outside of a few happenings that you read about in the book of Daniel. But at
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.120]   the end of those 50 years, in 538, something absolutely astounding happens,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.280]   almost a miraculous event. The alliance between a nation called Media and a
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.440]   nation of Persia, the Empire of Persia, join forces and they overthrow Babylon.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:38.280]   And interestingly enough, Cyrus, the Persian king, allows all the exiled
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.760]   captives to return to their homelands. He even commissions and finances, bankrolls,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.880]   the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem to rebuild both the city and the temple.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:10:01.000]   And then the first wave of exiles, 49,697 of them, commit to returning. So for the
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.400]   remainder of my sermon, I'm just gonna say 50,000, that's easier to remember. The
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.880]   50,000 return to a very different Jerusalem from what they have expected.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:21.520]   The Jerusalem of 536 was a wasteland. But the people have a holy burden to rebuild
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   the house of God and to rebuild the temple. So God's people have returned
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:34.000]   with one job to do, and this one job started in 536. So they begin to
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   work, lay the foundation on this new temple that's going to replace Solomon's
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.920]   broken one. But then the work stops and it's left incomplete and under
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:53.600]   construction for 20 years until 516. For 20 years, no further work is done on the
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.800]   temple. It would just lay there partially built. So people would go about their
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:07.280]   day-to-day lives passing this under construction temple of God that is just
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   there for 20 years. So if you're 18 years old, you're like, "What is that? How come
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.000]   we're not using that for anything? Oh, that's the house of the Lord." So for 20
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   years, there is no work that is done. So in the context of the book of Haggai, we
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.920]   find these people have basically just gotten busy with their day-to-day lives
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:33.640]   and 20 years, an entire generation, there's nothing done. I've heard people
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.200]   say that the God of the Old Testament appears to be an angry God, a God of
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.440]   wrath, and that the God of the New Testament is a God of grace, patience, and
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   love. And I do understand that just on a cursory reading how you can kind of end
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.880]   up thinking that, but here in Haggai, I see just one of the many examples of the
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:00.320]   long-suffering patience of the Old Testament God. We learn from Malachi 3:6,
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.880]   we learn from Hebrews 13:8 that God does not change, that Jesus Christ, who is God,
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   is the same yesterday and today and forever, and that because God does not
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:20.680]   change, we are not consumed. We serve a very, very patient gentleman of a God. The
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.720]   Old Testament saints also served a very, very patient God. And because God did not
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:34.760]   change, the people in the book of Haggai were also not appropriately consumed. So
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.960]   here you have the background of the prophecy of Haggai in this short
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.480]   book. So that's the first question, what is the context? The second question is, who
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.920]   are the recipients? And are they at all similar to us here living in the 21st
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.840]   century Orange County? Verse 2 says, "Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'This people says,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   'The time has not come, even the time for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt.'"
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.440]   Basically, it's a hard attitude of, "Not right now." Later, when things are more
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.400]   settled, "Not right now, we have mouths to feed. Not yet, because we have to get
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.840]   married. We have to have children. Not yet, because we have to have just food on the
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.240]   table, clothes on our backs. Not yet." So who are the "this people" that has the
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.880]   "not yet" attitude? First of all, it's very important to mention that they were a
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:40.440]   well-meaning people. They were people who were passionate about the renown of God.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.600]   They were people who started this journey with an understanding that God's
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.520]   glory was of utmost priority. And they were the 50,000 who accepted Cyrus's
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.040]   invitation to go back to Jerusalem. I'm gonna read Ezra 1, 3 to 5 for you.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:04.760]   Cyrus says, "Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.320]   Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the Lord,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.640]   the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem. Every survivor, at whatever
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.440]   place he may live, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.600]   with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.920]   which is in Jerusalem. And then the heads of fathers' households of Judah and
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.160]   Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, even everyone whose spirit God had
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.840]   stirred to go up and rebuild the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem." So who
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.360]   are the "this people"? They were the 50,000 the Spirit of God had stirred up.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.880]   And I Google-searched, actually, how many Jews were living in Babylon at the time
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.000]   of Cyrus's decree, because I wanted to kind of see, in contrast to all of the
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.640]   people who are living in Babylon, what percent this 50,000 encompassed. But I
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.560]   couldn't find an exact answer. But it has been suggested that the majority scoffed
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.280]   at the idea of returning to the wasteland that was Jerusalem. Remember,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.400]   for 70 years, Jerusalem had been a dangerous and uncultivated place. For the
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.920]   great majority, Babylon had become home. So there was no desire to return to
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.640]   Jerusalem to rebuild the temple of God. If you and your parents and your
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.280]   grandparents were living in a place for 70 years, you're not going to be so eager
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.920]   to move away. If you are a third or fourth generation person of a different
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.840]   ethnicity, as many of you in here are, how would you feel if you were called to
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   return to China, Japan, the Philippines, Mexico, or Korea? Nah. Home is America.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:57.760]   I don't want to go back. But not "this people." So the recipients of the book of
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.720]   Haggai and Zechariah were those who decided to leave home and go. They were
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.240]   the ones who took a risk and placed a higher priority on God's glory than
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.160]   their own comforts. But something happened. Something derailed them.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:23.360]   Something caused them to drift. And that's the "why" of "Why is Haggai Written?" that
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.880]   we're gonna get to. So what caused the stoppage of the work amongst this
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:37.960]   well-meaning, missions-minded people? Good intentions only got them so far. They went
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.240]   to the mission field, basically, and stopped doing their mission. They were
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.440]   people that took a risk to go, and then now they get rebuked. So why was Haggai
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:57.520]   Written? And what was the stoppage a result of? First, there was opposition
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.960]   from those who had since moved into the area formerly known as Jerusalem. So when
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.520]   the people were exiled for 70 years, those who remained in the land were the
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.120]   weak, the poor, the elderly, and the small-time criminals. And a lot can change
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.440]   in 70 years. And the folks who have been calling Jerusalem home for 70 years
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:26.280]   likely were not happy when they saw 50,000 strangers coming and saying, "We
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.680]   need to build a temple of God. We need to build a city. Get out. This is our home."
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.840]   And they're like, "We've been here for 70 years, bro. This is not your home." So
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.120]   there's opposition. So the Jews kind of forcibly settle, and they are constantly
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.560]   harassed because they have no city walls. And because there are no city walls,
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   they're constantly living in fear. Opposition, tension, fear. These
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.120]   contributed to the work stoppage and the rebuilding of the house of God. And I
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.080]   can imagine the people thinking, "Hey, God, you're the one who called us to return
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.520]   to your holy city to build your temple. Why are you making it so hard? Why don't
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.120]   you come help us wipe them all out? Why are you allowing all of this opposition?
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:20.080]   We did not leave the comforts of Babylon to struggle like this. It's your fault.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.360]   You're not that powerful after all, are you?" These are the thoughts that might be
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.840]   going on in their heads. And it's not hard to imagine this because people of
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.080]   God have always said similar things like this, especially when they left their
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.480]   lives in Egypt as slaves. Secondly, the well-meaning people of God faced
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.680]   physical and economic hardship. Their day-to-day lives were hard. So we see
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   that they never had enough to eat, they never had enough to drink, their clothes
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:56.960]   and their wages were not enough. So they did not expect a life devoted to serving
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:04.160]   God would be so rough, would be so difficult. The years shortly after their
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.480]   return to Jerusalem were met with a severe drought in the land. So in an
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:14.080]   agrarian economy, drought meant no food. So how can they focus on rebuilding the
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.760]   temple when there's no food? They had mouths to feed. If God really wanted this
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.960]   work to be done, wouldn't he not rain down quail? Would he not allow manna to
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.480]   come forth? We're hungry. Where is God in all of this? Perhaps the people thought
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.400]   it was God's will just to take care of their families for the time being, until
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.080]   time of harvest. Third, there were also generational differences and
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:49.640]   expectations. Among the 50,000 that returned, there were a number of old men,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:56.520]   heads of clans, many of whom had seen Solomon's temple. These were old men
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.320]   whose dying wish was likely to rebuild the temple of God. And they probably
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.040]   shared stories of the grandeur and the glory of Solomon's temple to the younger
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.000]   men and their families. They probably talked at length of all the freedoms
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.600]   they used to enjoy as children and the renown their once mighty nation had
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.120]   enjoyed. And it's not hard to imagine that these old men, these patriarchs who
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.800]   are holding on to the hope of seeing Jerusalem again --
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:35.520]   sorry, I just lost my --
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   --
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:45.120]   it's not hard to imagine that these patriarchs were the ones who convinced
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   their families to take them back to the homeland that they had left 70 years
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.080]   before. So in addition to these old men, there were also young men who were
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.160]   excited for these new adventures, who were passionate about glorious causes. So in
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.560]   Ezra chapter 3, we see an almost comical and yet depressing scene. I'll read this
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.160]   for you. "Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' households,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.280]   the old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.520]   foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.920]   for joy, so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.160]   joy from the sound of the weeping of the people. For the people shouted with a
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.520]   loud shout, and this sound was heard from far away. So when the
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.440]   foundation is laid, the old men weep, because this was such a tiny, run-down,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.720]   ugly temple, nothing like the one that they grew up looking at and marveling at.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.840]   'This temple sucks!' the old men are saying. 'We did not come back to do this! You
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.720]   young men need to work harder!'" So there is a shout of just sadness and sorrow, but
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.160]   at the same time, the younger men, what are they doing? They're pumping their
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.080]   fists and shouting and celebrating as if they had done something absolutely
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.880]   grand for the Lord. "Look what we did! God is using us! We built the temple of God!
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:14.960]   Woohoo! We are awesome!" That's this tension that these two generations are facing
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.080]   with each other. So it's not hard to imagine that the old men were constantly
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.760]   criticizing the efforts of the young men who were actually doing the building. So
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.120]   the young men were probably thinking, "We just need these old men to die, so we
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.960]   could build it our way." And it stopped. Lastly, there was also probably some
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.320]   disunity in the leadership. Joshua, the son of Jehoshadoc the high priest, wanted
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.120]   the Jews to submit their religious liberties to the Persian government,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.640]   since the Persians were very tolerant people and seemed to be pro-Yahweh.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.960]   Zerubbabel, the governor and a descendant from the line of David, felt that the
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.520]   only way to truly honor God was to have a complete independence from all pagan
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.600]   nations, including Persia. So basically, one leader wanted separation of church
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.960]   and state. One leader wanted pure theocracy. Again, there's nothing new under
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:16.160]   the sun. So could it be that perhaps these differing opinions on how this new
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.040]   nation-state should be run and governed contributed to the stoppage in the work?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.600]   After all, when your leadership is divided and there's disunity, you really
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.320]   can't move forward as a people for any kind of work. Opposition, the demands of
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.760]   the day-to-day, generational differences, disunity in leadership -- all these things
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.920]   contributed to the temple being left under construction for 20 years. So God
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:51.000]   appears and explicitly says to his people, "Consider your ways. Let's
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.560]   reevaluate these priorities. Have you forgotten the very purpose for which you
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:03.320]   return to Jerusalem?" And I want to read Haggai 1, 8 through 11 for you. "Go up to
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.640]   the mountains, bring wood, and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.800]   be glorified," says the Lord. "You look for much, but behold, it comes to little, and
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.000]   when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?" declares the Lord of hosts. "Because
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.520]   of my house, which lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.960]   Therefore, because of you, the sky has withheld its dew, and the earth has
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.280]   withheld its produce. I call for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.720]   the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground produces, on men, on cattle,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.920]   on all the labor of your hands." Basically, God is saying, "You know why your lives
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.280]   are so frustrated? It is because you have forgotten the purpose for which you have
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:54.600]   come." And so here's God's charge to get back on track. And I'm so blessed and
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:01.200]   encouraged by their response. Verse 12, "Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.120]   and Joshua, the son of Jehoshadoc, the high priest, with all the remnant of the
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.840]   people, obeyed the voice of their Lord their God and the words of Haggai the
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.760]   prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.040]   the Lord. Then Haggai the messenger of the Lord spoke by the commission of the
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.800]   Lord to the people, saying, 'I am with you,' declares the Lord. So the Lord stirred up
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.360]   the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.160]   of Joshua, the son of Jehoshadoc, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.440]   of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts their
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.400]   God on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king." The
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:45.520]   people hear the words, they're like, "You are right. We have forgotten our purpose."
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.560]   And they all somehow rally together in a period of three weeks. They strategize,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.920]   they obey, and then they finish the work. Work that has been left untouched for 20
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:03.560]   years, God unites their hearts and they get to work. And they finish the temple.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:09.240]   So it's a long history lesson, but it's very important because there's a lot of
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:15.080]   similarities between them and us. Those in Haggai's audience and you and me
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.960]   sitting here this Sunday have two things very much in common. In fact, the twelve
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.560]   disciples of Jesus Christ and the early Christians shared this commonality with
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:32.040]   us as well. For all of human history, actually, all the people of
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.080]   God have these two things in common. And though the historical and cultural
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.680]   contexts may differ to varying degrees, there are two things that are exactly
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.560]   the same for them, for us, for the Apostles, for everybody who are called
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:52.400]   God's children. The first one is our purpose is exactly the same. Our purpose
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:59.160]   is the same. And secondly, our priority list, our to-do list, I will call it task.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:06.400]   Our tasks are exactly the same. And allow me to show you a passage you are likely
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.160]   already very familiar with. If you look at this side, you have Haggai. If you
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:16.280]   look at the other side, you have the Great Commission. When they saw him, they
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.640]   worshipped him, but some were doubtful. And Jesus came up and spoke to them,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.840]   saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.960]   and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.600]   and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.760]   commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.880]   There are parallels here. There is worship, there is a commission, and there is a
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.920]   promise that God is with them, and he is with us. I said that the two things all
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.280]   the people of God throughout the history of time have in common are our common
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:04.560]   purpose and our common task. So what is your purpose? What in the world are you
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.720]   doing here this Sunday? Well, James 4:14 says that we are just a vapor that
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.800]   appears for a little while and then vanishes away. The purpose of our short
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.960]   and vapor-like lives is to be spent for the kingdom of God. Let me say this to
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:30.120]   you again. The purpose of your existence is to be spent, to be exhausted, to be
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:37.360]   maximized for the kingdom of God. The only reason your life has any value is
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.920]   for the building up of the kingdom of God. Outside of giving glory to God, your
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:53.840]   life has zero purpose. Let that truth sink in. Outside of giving glory to God,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:02.560]   your life is meaningless and has zero purpose. Our natural ear and our flesh
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:10.080]   and our natural man may hear this and be offended. Outside of giving glory to God,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:19.600]   your life has zero purpose. This is offensive. And if it's so offensive as
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.800]   you hear this that you have already rejected it, I can almost guarantee that
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:33.440]   the Holy Spirit of God does not abide in you and you are an unbeliever. For that
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.000]   is the root of atheism, agnosticism. People do not become atheists because
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.600]   they've done careful research. People become atheists because they want to
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:52.360]   live for themselves and however they want. And the easiest way to do that is
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:59.520]   to remove from their religious paradigm a God that is all-demanding. But the
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.640]   Bible from cover to cover, you cannot land on any other conclusion that
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:11.840]   outside of giving glory to God, your life has zero purpose. Now if you do have the
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.200]   Spirit of God residing in you, there will be a passionate amen that echoes in your
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.440]   heart when you hear your life's purpose. When you hear that your life is supposed
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.520]   to be spent for the glory of God, in your hearts there's gonna be a reaction that
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.560]   says, "You know what? Amen." You may struggle always to remember it because I
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.400]   struggle all the time to remember this. But there will be a natural, almost
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.000]   reflexive agreement with this because that's what the Holy Spirit of God
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.120]   points to every time you open up your Bible, that your life outside of serving
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.800]   the Lord has zero purpose. The truth is actually also very liberating. It's
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:02.840]   exciting. We serve a God in whom there is ultimate satisfaction and joy. We are
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.520]   being spent for the purposes of the Creator of the universe who knows each
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:15.200]   and every creature by name. You are loved as a believer. So revel in your purpose.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.720]   This makes me think of the Toy Story movies. You guys all seen Toy Story? There
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:29.280]   are few movies that are as theologically rich as Toy Story. Early on in the movie
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.680]   we are introduced to Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, and he has been pre-programmed
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.600]   with a mission and with delusions of grandeur that he's a savior. He believes
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.800]   himself to be of utmost importance and vital to defeat of the empire of the
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:55.440]   Emperor Zurg. So when the other toys in Andy's room try and welcome him, Buzz is
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.200]   friendly but yet condescending. And when the leader of the toys, Sheriff Woody,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:07.640]   Andy's favorite and yet super friendly, selfless, loving leader of the toys
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:14.800]   proceeds to speak the truth in love, Buzz scoffs at him. So later in desperation
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.360]   and frustration when the two of them are stranded at a gas station before they go
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:32.440]   to Pizza Planet, Woody loses his mind and he yells at Buzz, "You are a toy! A child's
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:43.120]   plaything! T-O-Y, toy!" And you see his mouth just explode in righteous rage. And
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:50.000]   it's not until later that Buzz Lightyear has an "aha" moment when he sees hundreds
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.480]   and hundreds of boxed up Buzz Lightyear's and he is finally liberated.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:07.000]   The truth sinks in and then in Toy Story 2 and 3 and soon to be 4, he is
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.520]   happier than he has ever been when he discovers that his primary purpose is to
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:21.840]   be loved and played with. Because he's loved by a good, good owner. Buzz Lightyear
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.360]   was created and purchased solely for the purpose of bringing delight to this
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:35.520]   loving owner who treats him with so much affection. And this delight in his
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.640]   purpose is good because his owner is good because he is loved by the owner
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.520]   who is good. So what is your purpose? What is my purpose? The chief end of man is to
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.640]   glorify God and to enjoy him forever, to be loved and to love as we learned
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.000]   through Pastor Nate's message last week.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.360]   What is your purpose? You are created by God and for God to love God and to serve
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   God. I will say it again. You are created by God and for God to love God and to
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.880]   serve God. This is the backbone of the meta-narrative in the Scriptures. This is
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:27.480]   the heartbeat of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And if that is our purpose, then
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.640]   how is that played out in our lives? What is the application of this purpose? What
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:37.000]   are we to do with all that we just learned? The specifics may vary for each
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.480]   and every one of us who has accepted Christ Jesus as both Savior and Lord, but
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.160]   our primary task, obligation, and duty in this life for you and for me is one in
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.560]   the same. It's to make the fulfillment of the Great Commission our life's chief
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:35:00.040]   obsession. Our purpose is to glorify the Lord. Our primary task is to build this
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.280]   church, to build his kingdom. But if you forget your purpose, you will be
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:14.620]   faithless and unfaithful to your task. Again, for the natural man, this is
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:21.880]   extremely offensive. Worthy of scorn, derision, ridicule, and objection. How dare
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:28.420]   you tell me what my purpose is, that I'm created to serve someone else? That's the
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:34.200]   natural man's rejection. But that is the teaching of the Bible, and you can't get
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.680]   it any other way. If you search the Scriptures carefully, you cannot but land
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.120]   on this conclusion. So it says, "Consider your ways, consider your purpose, and
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.000]   consider the task you have been assigned to in this life. You and I are not unlike
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.800]   the 50,000 well-meaning people of God who returned to Jerusalem from
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.840]   Babylonian captivity. We too get discouraged by opposition. We're derailed
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.680]   in life by our challenges and hardships. We're distracted with the good and noble
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.800]   responsibility of putting food on the table, making a living, providing our
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.560]   children with homes and with futures. But you need to remember, consider your ways,
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:22.720]   that your primary purpose is the worship of God, and our collective purpose is in
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.200]   the building up of his church. And I'm not just talking Berean community church,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.120]   but rather his global church. So let me ask you guys a question. Is the Great
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.960]   Commission your life's obsession? Is making disciples of all nations and both
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.120]   learning and teaching all that the Lord has commanded you in his Word your life's
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:49.080]   primary obsession? Is the work of God your daily obsession? You don't need to
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.840]   be clergy or in the full-time pastorate have this as your daily obsession. You
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.400]   don't need to be on the missions field abroad to have this be your daily
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:05.920]   obsession. So let me ask you, what is your daily obsession? Is it your kids? Your job?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:18.760]   Your workout regimen? Getting pregnant? Saving for a house? Entertainment? Your
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:25.560]   food? Your meals? Others' opinions of you? Being loved by people? Because whatever
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:32.840]   you daily obsess over, you will build your life around. Whatever you daily
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:38.640]   obsess over, you will build your life around those things. Scripture says, "Make
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:44.000]   your obsession his kingdom and his righteousness. Seek first, zay tay tay.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.680]   Have as utmost priority his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.920]   will be added to you," says the oft-quoted Bible verse. So is your daily obsession
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.960]   kingdom work? Or are you saving that for later? The time has not come. Even the
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.200]   time for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt. I have to finish my degree. I
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.960]   have to finish my career. I have to get married first. I have to have kids first.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:15.800]   I have to wait till my kids are grown and in college first. My job right now is
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.440]   to focus on me. God's kingdom is for later when I have more time and my
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:37.600]   retirement fund comes in. Are you saving all of your passions for later? If you're
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.280]   in the habit of praying regularly, may I ask you, what do you spend most of your
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.840]   time praying for? That will be the dead giveaway to what your heart's
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.200]   obsessions are. Because I know guys who they pray hardest when there's a girl
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:58.320]   that they like. "God, grant me success but not as my will but your will be done. But
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.840]   grant me success and help her like me back." I know guys because they come and
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.600]   talk to me. "Boss Peter, I like this girl. What do you think?" And I don't even ask
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.560]   them, "Did they pray about it?" Because I know they did. Because they pray
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.720]   passionately about that kind of stuff. Can I challenge you to spend more time
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   praying for church and for evangelistic needs than your prospective job, spouse,
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:27.080]   or health? Can I challenge you to not pray for the well-being or the safety
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:39.000]   of your kids? I purposely do not pray for my kids' safety. As a father, I absolutely
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.160]   desire their safety. And I will gladly put myself in harm's way to keep my son
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.600]   and my daughter safe. But I've discovered something about prayer and its effects
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.240]   on my heart. The more I pray for something, the more that slowly becomes
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:02.480]   my objective, my aim, or my goal. Perhaps God desires to use Charis to be a
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:08.280]   martyr in the missions field. What if God wants Maddie to glorify him through a
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.240]   terminal childhood disease? There is something in my flesh, in my paternal
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:22.640]   instinct that screams, "No way! God, no!" But if I truly trust in a God who is
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.480]   perfectly good, and in a God whose will is perfect, I have to trust that he loves
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:33.500]   my children more fiercely than I ever could. And in this fierce love, if he
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.640]   desires their momentary physical death, then as a created being whose sole
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:45.460]   purpose is to give glory to God, my soul must cry, "Hallelujah! God be praised."
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:53.040]   Because Maddie and Charis, they too have been created by God, for God, to love God,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:00.400]   and to serve God. My prayer for my son and daughter is that they will seek
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.680]   first his kingdom and his righteousness, that they will be useful in building
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:10.640]   God's kingdom, that their lives will be spent and exhausted in honoring Christ.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:17.700]   For therein lies their purpose. My task is the great commission and the greatest
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:25.200]   good, and their task is a great commission and their greatest good. And
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.040]   currently what God is teaching me is that the best thing that I can do for my
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.880]   kids is not to give them what this world tells me to give them, what some of you
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:40.080]   tell me to give them, but rather to teach them and to show them the love of God. To
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.680]   teach them and to practice in front of them the fierce love and grace of God.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.160]   And to teach them about the broken heart of God. And one of the saddest things
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.240]   about leaving my former job at Compassion is I can't take my kids to
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:02.480]   meet the poor as easily as I could have, as easily as I can. I can't now take
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   them to just meet the poor, to show them the broken heart of our God. My primary
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.600]   job as a father is to help my children know the broken heart of our God, to know
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.800]   the deep, deep love of my God, and to have Christ be Lord over all of their lives.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.240]   This is your job as a parent. What kind of theology are your children forming as
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:34.560]   they watch your life? Parents, does God exist for them? Is that what you're
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:39.160]   teaching them with your life? Or are you teaching them that as for me and my
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:47.760]   household, we will be exhausted for the purposes of God? And my purpose, and
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.960]   this is what I daily obsess over in my prayers for my children. And this is also
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:59.240]   my primary job as a pastor. Some of the people that I love the most, if they are
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.920]   straying from the purposes of God, I actually pray that God would wreck and
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:11.120]   break their comfortable lives. If they are straying from God's purposes, I am in
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:17.400]   this room praying for the wrecking ball of God to enter into their lives. Now I
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.560]   don't tell them. That's what I'm praying for for them. But this is sometimes what
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.840]   I pray. And this is what I pray for some of you. But on a side note, if your life
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.560]   has been hard recently, don't come and TP my car or something. I'm not sure that
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:42.000]   my prayers are that effective. Our life's purpose is we are created by God and for
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.720]   God to love God and to serve God. Our life's primary purpose, our one job, is to
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.400]   do our part in fulfilling the Great Commission. So what then is our
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.480]   application? How do I tangibly and practically go into my mountain and
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:01.280]   bring down wood and then build in my life? Here it is. Fulfill your duty as a
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:08.480]   missionary. Fulfill your duty as a missionary. You are a chosen people, a
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:15.120]   royal priesthood, a missionary, 1 Peter. Now the first thought that enters your
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.520]   mind should not be, "Is God calling me to drop everything and go overseas for
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:26.400]   mission work?" No. The first question that enters your mind should be, "In the
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:34.000]   mission fields that I am already in, am I being faithful to the task? In the mission
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.320]   fields that God has already divinely placed me in, am I being faithful to the
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.400]   task? Am I not always when converts in my fields?" Because God is the one who makes
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.080]   them grow, but am I faithfully sowing seeds? Am I faithfully watering in the
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:53.800]   fields that I'm already in? I actually strongly dislike the romanticizing of
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.520]   overseas mission work. In fact, I think the phrase, "Go on missions," that you hear
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.400]   around Throne a lot, especially before summer, I think it's dangerous and it's
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:11.200]   an unbiblical phrase. And I hate it. "Go on missions." I understand it, but I really
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.000]   strongly dislike it. So if you ever say that with me, I might just give you a
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.960]   look. Some people think that serving God as a long-term missionary or a
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.680]   full-time pastor is the holiest of calls and living an ordinary day-to-day life
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.840]   is a compromised life. No. Some think overseas mission work is the best way to
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.200]   fulfill the Great Commission. No. The only verb, the only command in the Great
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.040]   Commission is "ma'athe tu'o," "make disciples." Going is just one of the attendant
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.320]   participles. You can spend all your life in Orange County and be exceptionally
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.960]   useful in the building up of the kingdom of God. So some of you guys are like, "Yes!
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:54.400]   Woohoo! God is not calling me." So the point and emphasis of our message today is this.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:01.480]   Daily faithfulness, not long-term legacy, is what you need to think about. Pray over
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.640]   it and be open to going overseas, but do not glorify overseas mission work or
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.920]   pastoral ministry. Glorify the Lord, and if he calls you to glorify him
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:19.680]   specifically in a cross-cultural context, then go and glorify him there. Until then,
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:27.320]   be here passionately. I know Jameliot is a hero to many Christians, and I've heard
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.880]   some people say, "Oh, I want to be like Jameliot and be martyred for the Lord."
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.520]   And I have to hold my tongue because I almost want to tell them, "Don't aspire to
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:42.200]   die like Jameliot in Ecuador. Aspire to live like he did in America." And I'm like,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.040]   "I want to wrap him, knock him in the head." Your focus and your aspiration has to be
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:54.160]   daily faithfulness, not long-term legacy or glory for yourself. So if you are
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.320]   failing today, right now as a missionary in the field you are already in, please
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:04.080]   do not go abroad. If you are banking on the summer trip to snap you out of your
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   spiritual stupor and perpetual dryness, do not go abroad. You will do more harm
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.400]   than good. Well, since we are on the topic of overseas mission work, let me add one
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.240]   more thing. This next statement is more my personal preference and opinion than
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:25.040]   it is biblical truth, okay? So, it's still going to be recorded, but whatever. If
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.120]   you're planning to go on a summer trip, may I encourage you to work, save money
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.680]   for it, and put your money where your mouth is rather than hit up everyone
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.520]   around you for support. I guarantee you you will get more out of the trip that
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:46.800]   way. You will be taken more seriously. There are other ways to ask for prayer
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:53.840]   and raise awareness. I want to reserve all my giving to long-term people. If you
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:48:00.000]   can fund your own trip, do so. If you can't, just be missional in a less expensive
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.120]   field that you're already in. Again, this is not necessarily an official charge of
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.240]   the church, so don't go tell Pastor Peter and get me fired or some kind of
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   prohibition. It's just a response from an older Christian and a former overseas
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.280]   missionary seeing summer short-term missions and missionaries who are
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:25.960]   treating mission work like a Christian resume builder or a glorified vacation.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:33.280]   If you're daily faithful in the field to which God has already called you, He will
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:40.160]   enlarge your field, guys. If you are faithful right now in the field you are
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.920]   already in, He will enlarge your field is the kingdom economics that we find in
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.360]   Scripture. So the call is to daily faithfulness, not shooting for long-term
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.780]   legacy. The call is to build His spiritual or to build His church one
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.680]   spiritual brick at a time, and that has to be your obsession. And this can't just
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.760]   be the obsession of those on the pulpit. Be faithful in the field you're already
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:11.160]   in, and He will enlarge your field. You know, I'm very unimpressed by believers,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:17.120]   especially young guys who talk a big game, who like to speak theology, who tell
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:24.740]   everyone they're praying over going for overseas. I've seen it all, and I'm very
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:31.340]   unimpressed. What I am impressed by is a believer who steadily and faithfully
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:35.420]   lives to please the Lord in all situations, whether at work or at home
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:41.940]   or at church, in his relationships with people, and especially what he does with
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:49.300]   his free time and with his free money. That's what I'm impressed by. And when I
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:54.100]   see a faithful Christian like this, I go after him. I want to disciple him. I want
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:50:01.780]   to train him up. I want to just walk alongside him. Someone who needs an
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:06.460]   overseas mission trip to be missional is a danger both to himself and to the
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:14.860]   field. So with that said, I pray for many missionaries to be sent off from this
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:28.540]   church. And I pray for many martyrs to be from this church. Not that martyrdom is
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:37.580]   something you aspire to. Martyrdom is never a goal. But it's evidence, and it's
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:44.340]   fruit of faithful Christian living. Second Timothy 3:13, "Indeed, all who
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:50.380]   desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. All men will hate you
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:56.820]   because of me, says the Lord Jesus. When you shine brightly in the darkness, do
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.780]   you think that there is not going to be a hostile response from those in
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:07.660]   darkness? If my son and daughter are hated because they are shining brightly,
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:15.140]   though my flesh screams no, my spirit cries out, 'Hallelujah, Amen, let it be.'" And that
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.020]   is how I am supposed to live, and that is how you are supposed to live, because our
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:26.740]   purpose is one and the same. What kind of theology are you teaching your kids? What
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.300]   is your role in building up the universal Church of God? And more
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:35.100]   specifically and contextually, what is your role in building up this local
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.620]   Church of God and building up the community at Berean? There are many roles.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.340]   So if you actually look at Ezra chapter 2 in the context of the return from
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.420]   Babylonian captivity, you had a governor in Shesh Bazar, you had a Zerubbabel,
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.460]   then you have a high priest in Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, you have the prophets
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.420]   in Haggai and Zechariah, and then in Ezra chapter 2, there's a list and number of
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:02.420]   all the other people who returned from the land to build the temple. You have
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:08.020]   male servants, female servants, caretakers, male singers, female singers, you have
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:17.380]   people to tend 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, 6,720 donkeys. I guess donkeys
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:22.340]   procreate faster. You had gatekeepers. You have...the list goes on and on. I'm sure
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.180]   there were carpenters, masons, stonecutters, architects, and just buff
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:31.100]   men to do the lifting. 50,000 people returning with the sole purpose of
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.100]   rebuilding the Temple of God and the city of Jerusalem. One purpose, one task,
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:43.820]   many moving parts. What moving part are you? Are you being faithful to that task?
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:51.900]   Maybe you and I need to be careful to consider our ways. Daily faithfulness, not
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:57.820]   long-term legacy. Consider your ways. And my prayer is that we respond the same
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:04.340]   way I see the people responding in Haggai 112. They did not beat themselves up or
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.740]   wallow in their guilt. They obeyed the voice of the Lord, and they showed
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:15.660]   reverence for the Lord. Can we have that up on the slide?
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:26.020]   Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the Joshua son of Zeruzalot, the high priest,
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.740]   with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God,
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:34.140]   and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.100]   people showed reverence. So they reflected, they worshipped, they obeyed,
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:46.380]   and they got moving, and they finished the work. Here's the application. Trust
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:55.180]   and obey, for there's no other way to be what? Someone say it. Trust and obey, for
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:54:01.320]   there's no other way to be happy in Jesus. Maybe your frustration is due to
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.980]   the fact that you've forgotten your purpose. Maybe your depression is due to
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:11.260]   the fact that you've forgotten your purpose. Kory Ten Boom once said, "Never be afraid
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:20.380]   to trust an unknown future to a known God." In verse 13, God says, "I am with you. I am
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:26.380]   Immanuel." He waited 20 years. He's a patient God. And I want to close for us
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:34.540]   by reminding us what kind of God it is that we serve, what kind of God we have
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:40.380]   been created for, what kind of God we are loved by, and what kind of God we are
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:49.340]   called to serve. In Psalm 103, one of my favorite psalms, reads this, "The Lord is
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:55.580]   compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in loving-kindness. He will
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:59.940]   not always strive with us, nor will he keep his anger forever. He has not dealt
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.900]   with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:09.060]   For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving-kindness is
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:14.540]   for those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:21.060]   removed our transgressions from us. Just as a father has compassion on his
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:27.100]   children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him. For he himself knows
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:33.740]   our frame, and he is mindful that we are but dust. As for man, his days are like
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:39.980]   grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourishes. When the wind has passed over
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:46.500]   it, it is no more, and its place acknowledges it no longer. But the
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:50.580]   loving-kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:59.260]   fear him, and his righteousness to children's children. As for me and my
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:07.740]   household, we will serve the Lord. And may that be your cry at your house. May that
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:17.860]   be our church's main obsession to see his Great Commission fulfilled. Consider
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:28.780]   your ways. God is good, and he is deserving of all of who we are. How can
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.820]   we not share? How can we not go?
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:38.220]   Consider your ways. Let's pray.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:55.340]   Lord, help us to respond appropriately and to show you reverence and to give you
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:57:03.900]   the honor that you're due. We stray. We are prone to wander. Help us to stay
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   anchored and not to drift. For these things we pray in Jesus' name.
