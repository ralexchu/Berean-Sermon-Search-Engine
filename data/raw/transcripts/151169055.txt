[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll start.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [cough]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [footsteps]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   we thank you so much for this evening.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We pray that your Holy
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Spirit would give us understanding
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   that things that we've studied,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   things that may be confusing,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   things that
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   are important for us, Lord God, that
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   would convict us,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   challenge us, cause us to think
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   more deeply upon your character,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   what that means for us,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   the promises that you've given
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   that are relevant, and we pray
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Father God that you would continue to guide
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   and lead us so that our thinking, our
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   emotions, our will, all of
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   it, Lord, may submit to your living
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   word. And so we pray for your grace
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   this evening, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Okay. I know
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   that some of you guys, if not
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   most of you guys, are probably a bit
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   confused, okay?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And there's
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   no guarantee that the deeper we get into
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Isaiah that it's going to get any better.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So I, you know,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Isaiah is one of those books that is kind of hard
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   to grasp in totality.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Remember we said in the very
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   beginning, it is not written chronologically,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   it's not written
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   like, okay, this happens in this year, and the next,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   this happens, next happens.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's written kind of thematically,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   so it'll jump around from,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   you know, it'll go from prophecy a hundred
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   years later, which we're going to get into today,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and then it'll jump back to
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   the current situation, and then it jumps
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   forward to the end times, and then it jumps
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   backwards. So you kind of have to figure out
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   what they're referring to by
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   the text that you're looking at, okay?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So, just kind of a
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   larger, broader picture,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   just as a reminder, up to this
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   point,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   God is basically
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   giving an indictment to the nation of Israel,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   right? And
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   then He transitioned from that
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   to how He's going to judge Assyria.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The primary agent
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   of judgment was coming through the
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   nation of Assyria, right?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So it begins with, judgment
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   is coming upon Israel for this reason,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and then the Assyrians
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   were the ones that God was using as an agent of judgment,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and then He turns the table and says,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   the Assyrians, they're
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   going to be judged, because they're going to, again,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   God is not
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   pleased with the nation of Assyria. The only reason
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   why He's allowing them to do that
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   is because He's only using them as an agent.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And then, again,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   what I'm talking about in broad picture,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   okay, what's going on here?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Okay.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And then, right before
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   we went into break, basically, He
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   begins to say, here's the
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   judgment that's coming, here's the judgment that's coming
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   upon Israel, but God is not going to be
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   angry with Israel forever.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And then remember we looked at, if you turn to chapter 10,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   starting from verse 20,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He begins to talk about
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   how God is going to remain faithful to the
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   remnant of the nation of Israel.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then, in chapter 11,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   like how is He going to do that?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   How will He restore Israel?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Right? And so chapter 11
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He goes into the specifics of
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   how this restoration is going to come,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and specific prophecy to the nation
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   of, to the Messiah,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   about the coming of the Messiah.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And then, starting from chapter 12
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and on, to all the way to chapter
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   23-24,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He's going to be indicting all the nations.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So, if you've kind of flipped ahead
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   in the book of Isaiah, you'll see
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   that chapter 12 all the way to chapter
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   23-24,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   it's going to be the same theme. That theme
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   is, He's going to be saying, here's
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   the Midianites,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   the Philistines, the Babylonians.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   One by one, He's going to
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   have an indictment against them. Right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So, we're talking about for the next
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   maybe 10 chapters,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   you're going to see a similar theme going over
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and over. So, by the time, you're
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   already probably thinking, like, man, it's judgment
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   after judgment after judgment.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But, for the next 10 chapters, you're going to see something
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   very similar. So, my encouragement to
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   you is, I want you to pay
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   attention, not the broad strokes of,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   what is going on here?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Not the broad strokes of, here's judgment.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   If you read it superficially,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I guarantee you, you're going to get lost.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So, the way that I
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   designed the question, is that
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   you basically summarize each
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   section. What is the main
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   judgment on the Midianites?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   What is the main judgment on the Philistines?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   What is the main judgment upon
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   the Assyrians
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   and the Babylonians? So that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   when you think about the 10
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   verses, you have at least one theme.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   This is what's emphasized.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And that's what we'll talk about when we get to those chapters.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We're not going to go by
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   verse by verse. We're going to go by what is
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   happening with, what is the historical background
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   behind these nations, and why the
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   judgment is specific, and what are emphasized
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   in these. So that you can get a broad
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   picture for the next 10 to 12
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   chapters. Okay?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You have no idea what I'm saying.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Alright. So basically that's where we are.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Where we left off, before
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   we went on a break, and I know, you know,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   we're going to have to kind of re-gear back
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   up into this. That we
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   left off with God saying, He's going
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   to restore Israel back. So if you go back to
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   chapter 10, verse 20, the title
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   of that section is, "The remnant of Israel
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   will return." Right?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And then
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   we leave off in chapter 11.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So basically,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   He described the judgment that's coming
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   upon the nation as
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   a tree
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   where all the fruits and everything
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   in it is going to die. It's going to be all chopped
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   off. And only what is going to remain?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Stump.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Right? Only a stump is going to remain.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But He says, "But from that
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   stump is going to come the hope of the Messiah."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And so if you look at chapter 11,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   verse 1, it starts out by saying, "There
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   shall come forth a shoot from the stump
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   of Jesse." In other words,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   this judgment is going to come, and it's going to be so
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   thorough that the only thing that's going to remain
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   is the stump. But
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   even though there seems to be no hope,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   but from that stump, God
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   is going to bring the Messiah. And then He
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   goes into chapter 11 about the description
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   of the Messiah. And that's where we're
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   beginning. So one thing I want you
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   guys to be aware of as we're talking about this
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   is whenever we talk about prophecies,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   there's
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   you kind of
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   have to think of it in three different levels
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   when we talk about prophecies. Okay?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   One is
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   the immediate application.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   What is the prophet saying about
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   the historical context at
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   that time? Right? So when
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   he talks about the judgment of the nation of Israel,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   what is happening with Israel at that
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   time, and how is God judging them?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Right? The second
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   application is, what is the application
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   that
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   is fulfilled in Christ?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Okay? That's the second application.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   What is, okay, one is the
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   application is the immediate context. What is the
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   application that has to do with Christ?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then the third application
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   is what does that have to do with the end
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   times? Okay?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Let me say that again. Three different
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   levels that you have to think whenever
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   you see prophecies in the Old Testament.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   What is the immediate historical context?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   How is that fulfilled in
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Christ? And how is it fulfilled
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   at the end times? Okay?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yes?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Okay. So keep that in mind while
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   you are reading through the
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   prophecy of Isaiah.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's not just kind of like, oh, what's going on
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   in history, but how is it being fulfilled
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   in those other levels as well? Okay?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Alright. So I'm just going to go
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   down by the questions that I gave you.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   My gosh, technology.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Okay.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   [typing]
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Brian,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   is this connection
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   missing there?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It is there?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Oh, you just put it in. Oh, there you go.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Okay. Thank you.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Alright. So we're going to go by question by
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   question. Number one was describe the promise
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   of hope given to Israel
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   through the roots of Jesse.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Alright. The promise of
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   a descendant,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   you can see it, right?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Of Jesse is not simply a promise of an
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   ordinary man, but a king from a kingly line
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   of David. So when he says
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   that from this stump,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   from the shoot of
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Jesse is going to come this
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   man, right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He's not describing just any man. He's talking
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   about the kingly line. In other words,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   the description that he's giving is
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   the true king of Israel
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   that's going to come.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   He's not just talking about a person
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   or a prophet who's going to come. He's talking about
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   your king.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   So in everything that
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   he describes of this particular king
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   that's coming is in contrast
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to the other kings that
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Israel had. In other words,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   the invitement against the nation of Israel is that
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   you had all these prophets and kings who led
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   you astray. And the reason why you're
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   in the situation that you're in now is
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   because they worshipped idols, you worshipped idols.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They forsook God,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   you forsook God. They were selfish, so you
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   ended up being selfish. Right?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But now, the
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Messiah is going to come. The real
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   king is going to come, and this is what his kingship is
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   going to look like. Right? The first thing
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that's going to differ is that his reign will
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   be a reign of the Spirit of God.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Unlike the reign of the
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   previous kings.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Specifically, he says,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   "The Spirit of the Lord shall
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   and understanding."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Obviously, this is in reference to
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   who?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   To Jesus, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   This is clearly in reference to
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   the promise of the
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   coming Messiah, Jesus.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Jesus is fully
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   God. Why
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   does he have to have the
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Holy Spirit upon him?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   If he's fully God?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Do you understand the question?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Why even mention that?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   He's God.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Hm?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   [inaudible]
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I want you to keep thinking.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I'm not saying it's wrong.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   You know,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   sometimes when we talk about
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Jesus, we kind
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   of mesh his humanity and his
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   deity in such a
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   clear way that we kind of see
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   him. He is God-man,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   obviously, and he, in
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   every way he was like us.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But in every way he was not like us, because he had
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   deity, right? But
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Jesus Christ in his humanity
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   was not this superhuman mixture
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   of God and man.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   It was, that's why we say he was
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   100% God and he was 100% man.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   In his humanity,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   right, because he took on the form
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   of man, when he describes all of these
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   things that he's describing are a description
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   of his humanity, who in
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   the Spirit is leading.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Because when he became a human being, when he
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   was born of a virgin,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   he took on full humanity.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So, remember
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   years ago we had Dr. Proud, he came and he
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   gave a series
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   about Jesus and his identity
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and how we look at the New Testament
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and we automatically say, you know,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   everything that Jesus did, we can't
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   relate because that was God.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Right? But remember what Jesus said to his
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   disciples, "After I leave, when the Holy Spirit
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   comes, you're going to do even greater miracles."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   He says, "Not only was it
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   possible for you to do, you're going to be
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   doing it even greater because the
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Holy Spirit is going to be indwelling in you."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Right? So, the
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   description of Jesus that we see
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   in 11, yes, he is God-man.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But he's going to come fully
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   as a man and he's going to be
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   just like a man, he's going
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   to set an example
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   of what all the other kings should have done.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   But because of their fallen
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   nature, because of their selfishness and rebellion
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and idolatry that they couldn't
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   do, Jesus is going to come in
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   his humanity and he's going to take on,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   like this is what a true
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   king, a righteous king, should
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   have done. And that's what Jesus is going to
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   fulfill. Right? So, unlike
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   the other reign of the other kings,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   he will reign and his character
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   will be
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   characterized by wisdom, understanding,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   counsel, might, knowledge, and
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   the fear of the Lord, which all the other
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   kings lacked. Right? And
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   this is part of the reason why the Judgment was coming.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And all these attributes
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   are all descriptions of his reign.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Right?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I mean, you could talk about all
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   different kinds of attributes, but all of these things
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   are related to his reign
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   because that's who he is and that's what his
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   kingdom is going to look like. Right?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And so, because he's going to
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   be a king who's going to reign this way,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   who benefits from all of this?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   All of us. All of that applies to us.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Right?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It says
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   in verse 3 to 5, his rule
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   will be fair and
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   just. Right?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And his delight
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   judge by what his eyes see.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Why would he not judge by what he sees?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And then it says,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   he would not decide disputes by what
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   he hears. Right?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Wouldn't you be,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   wouldn't you need to hear and see to be able to make
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   right judgments? What does he mean by
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   that he would not judge by what he sees or hears?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Hmm?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He's not going to be deceived by just presentation.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   He's going to see reality. That's why
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   you know, everything that
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   we see, right? Everything that
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   we see, everything we do, we talked about this before.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   We're all biased.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Right? Every single one of us. I'm biased.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I'm tainted by my
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   personality. I'm tainted by my experience.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I'm tainted by my pride.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And so everything that I judge,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   it comes through a sinful screen.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   But he says when he makes a judgment
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   as a king, when he rules,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   he's not going to simply be tricked
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   by what someone's presentation.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Right? He's not going to believe
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   everything that he hears. He's going to see the truth
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   as it is. He's going to be fair and he's
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   going to be just. Right?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And so who benefits from this?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Verse 4.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   "But with the righteousness he shall judge
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   the poor and decide with equity
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   for the meek of the earth and he shall
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   strike the earth with the rod of his mouth
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and with the breath of his lips he shall kill
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   the wicked." So, who benefits
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   the most when the king is
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   righteous and his judgment is fair?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   People who are being
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   oppressed. Right?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   People who don't have the ability to
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   have proper justice. Right?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And we say it all the time.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The first person I think about
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   who benefited from his money
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   at least in my lifetime
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   was O.J. Simpson.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I remember when O.J. Simpson got off, everybody
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   said, "Oh, it's because he had spent millions of dollars
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   getting the right
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   attorneys to represent him." He said, "Oh, poor
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   man, we'll never have that kind of representation."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Right? Which is true.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So, basically what he's saying is
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   in a corrupt kingdom
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   where it's run by sinful men,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   if you don't have power,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   you're not going to get fair judgment.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   If you go to court, the people who have influence,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   people who have power, who have connection,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   they're the ones who are going to benefit.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   But the ones who are poor, who don't have
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   a voice, he said, "The king is
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   going to come and he's going to be fair."
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Right? So, when he
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   says he's not going to judge by what he sees,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   well, not because you have good clothes, or
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   because you have education, or you have connection,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   or you have money. He's going to judge
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   fairly. Right? That's what his kingdom is going to
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   be characterized by.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Right?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Right?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Okay. For this
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   one, I want you to take a few minutes.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Remember I asked you, when you guys
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   are going through this, the description
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   of the Messiah, how
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   much of this do you see actually fulfilled
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   in Christ? Right?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And so, I hope you took
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   some time to discuss that. So, I want you guys
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   to take maybe just another two, three
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   minutes in your group, just to discuss what
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   you found. What are some things that you found
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   that was fulfilled
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   in the life of Christ? Right?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   In the Gospels.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   What are some descriptions of Jesus
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   in this text, in chapter
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   11, that you see fulfilled in
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Christ? Character, what he
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   said, how he lived.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Okay? Then after a few minutes
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   of discussion in your group, I'll ask
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   some of you guys to kind of give us
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   your input.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   [inaudible]
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   [inaudible]
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   [inaudible]
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   [inaudible]
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   [inaudible]
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   [inaudible]
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   [inaudible]
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   [inaudible]
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   [inaudible]
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Okay.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Let's get some input. So, what are some of the things that
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   you found that
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   would apply to Christ that you see?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Just raise your hand and...
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Okay.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Okay. When Jesus was baptized, the
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Holy Spirit comes and rests upon him, just like
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   it says, right? Okay, good.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Uh-huh?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   [inaudible]
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Uh-huh?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   [inaudible]
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Okay.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Good.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   What else?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   [inaudible]
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Okay.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   [inaudible]
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Right.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   [inaudible]
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Okay. The physical descendant of David.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Yes. Okay.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   What else?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   [inaudible]
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   That he was righteous.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And he was faithful. Uh-huh.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Okay. Uh-huh?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   [inaudible]
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Good.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   He was able to discern beyond what
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the other people were seeing.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Right? I think about the widow who
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   was giving the offering. Right?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   He sees through, and that was a true offering.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Okay.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   What else?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   [inaudible]
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   A couple more.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   [inaudible]
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Okay.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   [inaudible]
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Sorry, I couldn't hear.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   The airplane.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   [inaudible]
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Okay. So,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   the way he carried out.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Okay. All right. Good.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Anything else?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   If you notice here,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   the promise of deliverance
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   for the nation of Israel
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   was not freedom from reign.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Right? He didn't say,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   you had all these kings and they
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   reigned you, now you don't have to live under suppression.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You're going to be free. He says,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   no, a good king is going to come.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   The problem that you had,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   you had bad kings. You had bad kings
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   from other nations who came and
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   they suppressed you, and then your kings led you
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   astray, but here comes a true king.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So, the promise
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   of deliverance is
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   good reign.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   The promise of deliverance
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   isn't freedom for us to do whatever we want.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   It's to have the right king to serve.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Right? So,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   in reality, for Christians,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   true freedom,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   the way that God created us,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   is for us to worship
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   the right person to
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   worship, to serve the right king.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Right? To submit.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   God created us
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   as beings
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   who were created for the purpose
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   of worship and service.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   You know what I mean? We were never
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   meant to be the focus of attention.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   God didn't create us
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   so that he could put us on a pedestal and glorify
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   us. We are
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   creatures to glorify, and when we
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   glorify, that's when we feel
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   life. You understand
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   what I'm saying? So, deliverance,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   salvation for Christians is in,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   you know, we deliver you so that you can be
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   free and so you can be glorified.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Right? When we feel the most alive
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   is when we're in the act of worship.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Think about your life.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Do you feel, I mean,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   think about the things that you
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   are the most attracted to.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   There's a reason why
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   we get caught up in
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   adoring stuff.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Whether it's cars, I mean, think about hobbies,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   or sports, or, and the more
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   spectacular it is,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   the more alive
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   we feel. Right?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Whether it's sports or whatever it is.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   So, God created us
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   to be worshippers,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   not to be worshipped.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Right? And so, when we,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and we're going to look at that next week
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   when there's a description of Lucifer in
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I think it's chapter 14, and
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   again, you know, I'm not going to spoil it for you,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   but you take some time to look into that.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And his, his whole rebellion
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   against God is he
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   wants to be in the position of worship.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He's trying to get
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   attention so that the glory that belongs to God
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   is going to come to him. Right?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So, the whole description of deliverance
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   for the nation of Israel is not about
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   how you're going to be free to do this,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   you're going to have all the food that you want, you're going to be
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   able to wake up, you never have to work,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   it's not all that. Right?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   The deliverance and the promise of salvation is
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   you're going to have the right king to rule over
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   you. You're going to have the right
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   person to worship. Right?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   To adore.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Okay?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   So how would you summarize
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   in verses 6-9? 6-9
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   it talks about the wolf shall dwell and the lamb and the
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   leopard shall lie down. So, if you look at
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   verse 6-9, what is the
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   what is the general description
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   if you were to summarize it in one word or a few
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   words?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   What did all of this
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   say in the show? I mean, is it literally
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   the lion and the sheep, are they going to
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   lie down and frolic around? Maybe.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But what are all
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   these descriptions generally
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   saying? That
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   when this kingdom comes...
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   [audience member] That good and evil
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   are going to be together?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Good and evil
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   will be together?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Good and evil? No, I'm trying to...
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   [audience member] I think it would be more
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   harmony. Harmony?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Okay. Yeah, I think that's what you
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   mean, right? There will be harmony.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   [audience member] Oh, okay.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I was trying to help you, man.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Okay.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Harmony, peace, right.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Right, right, right.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   [audience member] With humanity
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   and with species, because it's all...
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Right, right.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   [audience member] But I think when it comes to that point, that time,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   it will be what? Harmony. Right. Harmony,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   there's peace, there's strife.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   The tension is going to be gone, right?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   That's what you meant. Right, now I get it.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Okay. [laughter]
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   So basically it's described as a period of peace.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So all this, you know,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   judgment, all this war, you know,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   famine, all this stuff is coming because
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   we live in a fallen world. So when the
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   sin is taken away, all of that is
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   gone, right? And that's basically
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   a description of the Millennial Kingdom
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   that is described in Scripture.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Now, whenever we talk about the Millennial
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Kingdom, I mean, some of you guys may know,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   may not know, there's like a
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Amillennialism, Postmillennialism,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   there's Premillennialism. I'm not going to get into any of that.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I'm just going to tell you the right view.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Okay. You are at a Baptist church,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   so I'm going to give you our view,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   okay? The Biblical view, alright?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So, the Millennial
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Kingdom is talking about the end times. Remember
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   we talked about there's a promise
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   of restoration coming, there's
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   a promise of restoration that Jesus
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   brought when He came and He was
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   crucified on the cross. And then the
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   ultimate fulfillment of all of this
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   is at the Millennial Kingdom.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Now, the Millennial Kingdom
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   is when He comes a second time.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And the dead in Christ rises
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   up. And Israel is
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   restored. And Jesus
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   is the rightful King
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   of this world. And
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   what God intended in
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   the Garden of Eden is going to be
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   restored. And it's going to be a physical
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   kingdom. Now, is that going to be
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   a literally thousand years
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   or is that just a figurative number, a long
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   period of time? So, that's
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   what we call the Pre-Millennial view.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Post-Millennial. Amillennial basically
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   means there is no Millennial. We're in the Millennial.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   It's all, you know, it's all
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   allegorical.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   But I'm not going to get into all of this stuff. But
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   again, I believe
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   because the Bible says
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   that at the end times when
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Christ comes He's going to establish
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   a period of rule where
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   all the promises that He made
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   to the Church and to the nation of Israel
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   is going to be fulfilled at this period.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   So, when we talk about
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Jesus' reign that He's talking about
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   He, what we call the "Here
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and Not Yet" where He introduces
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   the fulfillment of that through the Church.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Right?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   But it's just an introduction.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   The actual fulfillment of that is going to come
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   at His Second Coming. So He started it.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Right? He started it
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   by being crucified and renewing,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   regenerating, establishing the Church.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   But all of that is going to lead to
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   the final product of the Millennial
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Kingdom. Okay?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Just file that. If that's going
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   over your head, just file that in your mind.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That the fulfillment of all of this
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   is going to be at the end times.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Okay? Now where is this
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   described in the Scripture?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   There's bits and pieces of it everywhere.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   But if you go to the end
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   part of the Book of Revelation, especially
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Revelation Chapter 20 and on,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   there is a detailed description of what that
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Millennial Kingdom is going to look like and what God's
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   going to do at the end time. Okay?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Again, we're not going to get into that because we're not studying
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Revelation, but again,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   that's what, for your
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   reference, like where is this going to be applied?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   That's when it's going to be applied.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   At the Second Coming of Christ.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Okay?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Chapter 11, 10-16
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   is a description of
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   that Millennial Kingdom.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Okay?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Who's going to come?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   This Kingdom is going to be worldwide.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   It's not just going to be Jews. It's not going to be just
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   a group. He says,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   what did I say?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   In Verse 10,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   "In that day,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   root of Jesse, who shall stand at the signal of the peoples
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   of him shall the nations inquire, and his
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   resting place shall be glorious." Right?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   He said Israel is going to be
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   restored, and
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   people from all nations are going to come
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and seek counsel.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   What does it mean?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That God will restore the remnant a second time?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Why is it called the second time?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Now, I don't have this here, but
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   when does the first restoration of Israel
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   take place?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   On the King Cyrus, right?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   The Persians come into power
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   later on, years later, and
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   King Cyrus allows them to go back,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   right, under Zerubbabel,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and they build the wall, they build
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   the second temple, which later on
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   gets destroyed again. That's the first
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   coming. But he says,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   in the second restoration of Israel,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and when is that taking place?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   The Millennial Kingdom.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Now, again, the
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   other view of that is, I'm not even
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   going to get into it because I don't want to confuse you.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   That Israel's
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   restoration, the promises that God has made
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   to the nation of Israel. Some say that the
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Church fulfilled all of these promises,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   but if you look at the
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   details, I think it
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   makes more sense that He
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   is referring to the nation of Israel more
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   literally. One of these days,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   I'm going to get into more details of that,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   but not today, okay?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Because once we start getting off-tangent,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   that's all we're going to be talking about.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   If you have questions of that, I'm more than willing to
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   talk about it with you afterwards.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The second
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   restoration of Israel will be all
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   over the earth. In other words,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   the Kingdom of Christ,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   He's going to be ruling through the nation of Israel,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   but it's going to be a rule that's
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   not going to be limited to the nation of Israel.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   It's going to be worldwide.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Will the gathering of Israel be literal or spiritual?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   There is
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   a spiritual fulfillment in
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Christ, which includes the Church
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and the Gentiles, but the literal
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   fulfillment is going to be in the
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Millennial Kingdom.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   That God is going to bring
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Israel back, and He's going to restore
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   them, and then eventually
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   He's going to come a
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   second time, and He's going to rule through them.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Okay?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Now,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   this view
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   was not a
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   popular view for a long
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   period of time, because when did the
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   physical nation of Israel disappear
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   in history?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Anybody know?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   AD 70.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   AD 70.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   At AD 70,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   after Jesus is crucified,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   He's resurrected, and He ascended, the Church
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   is going out, and at AD
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   70, the Zealots,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   the Jews, right,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   they decide to finally rebel against the
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Roman government, say, "You know, we're going to,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   we're not going to wait for the Messiah
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   anymore. Jesus came and He
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   disappointed us. Now we're going to do it ourselves."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So they go and they start having
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   terrorist attacks against the
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Romans. They finally
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   had it with the Jews,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   and they send the guards in,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   and they completely annihilate Israel.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   They go after, they
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   even go after the people in the
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   caves, to the Essenes.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   They completely wipe out
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   the Temple, all of it. Jesus
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   prophesied that when He comes into, you know,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   when He comes into Jerusalem riding on a donkey.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Right? See, utter destruction
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   of Israel. So from AD 70,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   the physical nation of Israel
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   disappears. When did they come
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   back?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   19, I
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   think it's 1943.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I could be off, or is it 43?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   It's 43 or 44, somewhere around there.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Right? So, now,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   is He referring to that Israel
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   now? Is He going to rule over that?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Obviously, He's not saying that if
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   you are born a Jew that you are God's chosen
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   people. So even if you don't believe in Christ,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   you are going to have a special place in the Kingdom of God.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   What He is saying is
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   a remnant of the nation of Israel
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   is going to experience a revival.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And they are going to be turned
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   into Christ. Right? And so,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   this view of the
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   literal application of the
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Millennial Kingdom and Jews coming back,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I mean,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   obviously if a nation disappeared
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   for over 1,000 years they are going to say,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Ah, you know, He probably meant that allegorically."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   But the fact that a nation that disappeared
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   in AD 70 and then
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   reappeared. So, when they first,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   when the Allies first gave that land
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   back to the Jews, after the
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Second World War, they initially,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   I was reading up on this, and they said, "Initially,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   they thought only a very small number of
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   people would actually come." Because they've
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   been spread out for over
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   1,600, 1,700 years. Was it more than that?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah, 1,900 years. Right?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   They've been spread out. So how are these people
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   who've been spread out for 1,900 years
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   all of a sudden going to make their way back?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   But we have Israel now.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I mean, all the news, like Israel is on the news
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   all the time. So since that
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   period, this view has been
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   revived. That maybe this
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   actually is going to be fulfilled
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   literally. OK?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And, again, in my opinion,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   you know, I wrestled with this for a long time,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   even in seminary. But
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   as I'm studying through the Old Testament,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   especially when I understand about
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   how the Jews understood the Kingdom,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and how even as
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Jesus is being,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   He's ascending. Remember the last
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   question the disciples ask Him?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   If you go to Acts chapter 1, He says,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   "Are you now going to restore the Kingdom?"
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   The Jews,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   their idea of the Kingdom is the nation of Israel
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   being restored, because this is all they've been reading.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Right? Every prophet
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   ends with, "God's judging you,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   but the Kingdom is going to be restored
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   when the Messiah comes." So that's all they're
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   thinking. So when Jesus is about to go up, they're asking,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   "Well, we thought you were going to establish the Kingdom.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   When are you going to do it?" Jesus says,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "It is not for you to know." Right?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And then He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   you, you shall receive power."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   So if Jesus is referring to
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   the Church being inaugurated
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   as the Kingdom,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   He would have answered that question by saying,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   "Oh, wait a few days. He's coming.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   The Kingdom is coming. The
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Church is going to fulfill that." Right?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   But He says, "No, you're not going to know."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Meaning that the real fulfillment
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   of it is not until later.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And you're not going to know. And I can't tell you.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Right? And then if you look
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   at Romans chapter 9
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   through 11, if you study the book of
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Romans, again I'm kind of sidetracking,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   if I already lost you,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I apologize. It's not
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   you know, you can still study
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   the book of Isaiah if you don't understand this.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   If you study the book of Romans,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   the whole book of Romans
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   tries to answer one question.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   What about the Jews?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Right? All the
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   way through, they're asking, "What
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   about the Jews?" If
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   we're all condemned, whether we
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   have the law or without the law, what about the Jews?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And so He keeps asking the question,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   "Then is God done with Israel?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Is God done with Israel? Has God
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   because of the unfaithfulness
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   of some, has God
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   been unfaithful to His promises?
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Has God forgotten Israel?" And He answers
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   that question repeatedly over and over again
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   by no means.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And then in chapter 9 through 11,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   He answers
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   that question, all three chapters,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "They've experienced a temporary hardening of their
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   heart until the fullness of time has
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   come," and then He's going to regraft them back
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   in. Meaning He's going to
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   fulfill the promises that He made. And
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   then if you go way back in the book of
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Revelation, where
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   there's a vision
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   given to John, and
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   he sees a vision of the nations
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   worshipping, he says he sees
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   the 12 tribes of Israel, and
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   behind them are all the
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Gentiles. So he
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   separates. So if it's
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   the church, why are
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   they separated at the end times, and the
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   vision at the end? So
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   there's other reasons, but
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   to me that was compelling enough
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   where, one,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   if you look at the prophecies that God
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   makes about Jesus,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   it is fulfilled literally in Jesus.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Virgin birth, riding on
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   a donkey, and all the stuff. So why do
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   we think that His Second Coming and His promises
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   are all going to be allegorical?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   I think it makes more
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   sense that if His prophecies
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   of His First Coming was going to be literal,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   the prophecies of the Second Coming is
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   also going to be literal. Right?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Alright, that's all I'm going to say. Okay?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   That's all in reference to
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   the Millennial Kingdom. So, it
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   begins, the fulfillment begins
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   with Christ, and it will end
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   with the Second Coming of Christ.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Okay?
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   - What does that mean, 48?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   - 48. Okay, we're off by
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   five. That's acceptable to
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   me, five years.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Alright.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   So,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   why was Ephraim, Northern Kingdom,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   jealous of Judah, the Southern Kingdom?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Right, he said, "When that time
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   comes, the tension is going to disappear,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   because ever since the two kingdoms split,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   even though the Northern
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Kingdom had ten tribes, and the Southern Kingdom
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   only had two, the ten tribes
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   was never blessed. They were never acknowledged by God
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   as a legitimate nation, because they broke
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   off. Right? Because the promised
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   fulfillment was going to come through the line of Judah.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And so, even though
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   that the Southern Kingdom,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   the Kingdom of Judah, and
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Benjamin, even though they had evil kings,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   God still blessed them. His promise
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   was coming through that line. And
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   the Northern Kingdom clearly saw
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   the blessing was upon the Southern Kingdom.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And so when he comes, he's going
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   to restore Israel. So the tension, again,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   all that description of peace and harmony,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   that even within the tribes, God's going
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   to restore all of them back.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Okay. I ask you to
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   consider the content of worship, instead of giving you
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   time to discuss, right,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   in verses one and six, what are some insights
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   that you found? In light
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   of this, in light of his faithfulness
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and his fulfillment, basically
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   there's a
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   worship that breaks out in chapter 12.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Right? You will see in
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   that day, right, when that day
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   comes, he's not going to command worship.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Worship is going to happen. You're going to
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   be so overwhelmed by the presence of Christ
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   that worship is going to just come out of you.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And he says, "I will give thanks
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   to you, O Lord, for though
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   you are angry with me, your anger
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   turned away, that you
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   might comfort me. Behold, God is my salvation.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I will trust and will not be afraid,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   for the Lord God is my strength and my song,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and he has become my salvation."
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   So, this praise and worship
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   that he's talking about, is not
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   just at the end times. It's about when
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Christ comes, this is going to happen.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   And that's the church, right?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   The nature of the church
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   is to respond to what Christ
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   has done, and to give worship. So,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   the question here was, what are some things that
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   you can observe about worship here?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Okay? Let me just
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   take a couple
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   insights from you guys, whatever you guys have
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   for that.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   So, for cry time for that day,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   what are some insights that you gained?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   I'll start you off, okay?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Where he says,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   "The Lord is my salvation."
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Right? "That our salvation
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   and God
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   are not two separate things."
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Right? So,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   if we celebrate the
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   work of the cross, without
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   celebrating an affection
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   for Christ,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   I think we missed the point.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Right? Jesus is our salvation.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   So, to say that
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I'm a believer of Jesus Christ because
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   he died for me on the cross, but I'm
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   not a good follower of Jesus,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   or, it's
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   an oxymoron. Right?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We are saved
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   because we are followers of Christ.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   We are saved because we know him.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   So, God is our salvation.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   So, the gospel and Jesus
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   cannot be separated.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Right?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Okay. I stirred the pot.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   So, your turn.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   [silence]
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Hmm?
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   [inaudible]
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Right. So, it doesn't separate like,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   oh, we worship and evangelism.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Often times we separate these two
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   things, but worship
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and evangelism are all
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   part of one pot. Right?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Because what is really worship?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Worship is adoring what we see.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Right?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And so, if you are actually
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   worshiping something, the first thing
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   that we want to do is tell people about it.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Right? If you
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   saw a great movie,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   those of you guys who went to see Star Wars, and you
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   really liked it,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and you came back, I guarantee
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   you, you told somebody about that movie.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Right? Because
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   we have a tendency to proclaim
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   the things that we adore.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Right? We just naturally,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   that's who we are. We are people who
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   worship. Right? So, he talks about
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   how in that day, when that happens,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   when you are in the presence of his glory,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   you are going to make known his deeds
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   among the people. Proclaim that his name
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   is exalted. And again, I think
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   you know, it's a shame when
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   we get so caught up and we
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   differentiate between worship and evangelism.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Evangelism really ought
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   to be an overflow of worship.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   So, when evangelism is not happening,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   there is something defected in
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   our worship. Right?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Because those two things are connected.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   You know? So,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I mean, I
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   guess in application it could be different.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   But the source behind worship
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   is the source behind evangelism.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Right?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   But when there is true worship,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   proclamation tends to follow.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Okay.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Um...
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   How about one more?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Okay.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   [Audience] To never cease in worship,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   because I specifically like
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   the part that says,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   "The Lord God is my strength
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and my song, and my salvation."
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   So, no matter what kind of
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   circumstances you may be in your life,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   in the lowest or even the highest point of your life,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   you should always worship the whole heart of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Right.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   You know, I think we talked about that
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   with Job. Right? We talked about
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   with all...as messed up as his life was,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   when God showed up,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   he just worshipped.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   And he was okay. Right?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   So, his source of life shows up and he
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   worships. So, our object of worship,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   he says it in verse 3,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   "With joy you will draw water
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   from the wells of salvation." Water representing
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   life. Right? So, where does
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   the water of joy
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   come from? It's from our salvation.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Right? When we recognize
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   what it is that we have in Christ, and when
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   we are beholden His glory,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   worship happens. And when true worship
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   happens, evangelism happens.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Right? And then when you're surrounded
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   with people who are worshipping evangelism,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   fellowship happens.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Right? And the church is built.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   So, at the end, it's
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   worship. Right?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And that's why the first vision of our church
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   is to worship God, the God-centered worship
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   and not man-centered. Because when
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   God is glorified, when we behold
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Him, evangelism, the
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   fuel for evangelism happens. And then
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   when...without those two things,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   you can call it fellowship, but it's not fellowship.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   You can gather together and
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   call it fellowship and do whatever,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   but it's not fellowship. Fellowship is
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   in the context when those two things are happening
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   when fellowship happens.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Okay?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Okay.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   So, from here, from chapter 13
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   and on, He's going to be focusing
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   His energy on the judgment of
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   all the nations. So, He starts with
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   judgment of Israel, chapter 1.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   And then He moves on to
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   judgment of Assyria, because
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   they're the ones that God uses. He says, "No, you're going to be
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   humbled." And then He says...He takes a
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   break and says, "But God is not going to be angry with you
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   forever." And then He says, "Israel
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   is going to be restored." And then
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   He turns His attention upon
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   the Babylonians, the Assyrians,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   the Midianites, the Philistines.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   One by one, all these people
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   who suppressed His people.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Even though God allowed it,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   He said, "Judgment is going to come upon them." Okay?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   And that's going to take us all the way to chapter
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   23. So He begins with the Babylonians.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   When He
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   refers to the Babylonians,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   did that already
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   happen?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   At the time
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   of this prophecy,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   were the Babylonians already in the
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   superpower?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   No.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   They were not. They're almost 100
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   years away. Right? The
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Babylonians exist, but they're not the superpower
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   that they're going to be eventually.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Right? It's about another
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   100 years before they become superpower, and
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   they come attack the southern kingdom
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   and then take them captive.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So a lot of people who are
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   what they call critical scholarship of the New Testament
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   say, "See, Isaiah could not have
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   been written during the period that
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   the Jews said, because
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   there's no way he could have written this about
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Babylonia, because historically
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   he's talking about stuff that didn't
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   happen yet." Right?
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   I remember the first time I ran into
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   this is I took a Western
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Civilization class at Fullerton
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   JC while I was at Biola,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   because I wanted to save some money.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And I went to Fullerton, and
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   one of the things that she said was
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   how the dating of Moses
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   was incorrect. That all these
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   hundreds of years that Moses
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   could not have written the Bible
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   in the period that the Bible was written.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   So I was like, "Why do
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   you say that?" And she said, "Because
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   there's things that Moses writes about the
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   dietary laws that Moses
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   could not have known."
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Because she's completely taken out the
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   supernatural aspect of it.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   She said, "The things that he mentions in the
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   dietary law, he couldn't have known.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Mankind did not know
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   until almost 700-800 years later.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   So therefore, Moses is
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   dated way later. So if Moses came
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   way later, and then
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   they start backtracking. So Judaism,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   as far as
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   they're concerned, was started with Moses.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Right? They don't believe all that
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   other stuff before, because Moses was the one who
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   wrote it. So therefore, she started
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   saying, teaching like a fact,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Zoroastrianism was the first
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   religion. And then Moses came about
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   700 years later, and started
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   copying that religion. And then the
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Mithraism started coming in, and they started
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   copying about the Messiah. And then Christianity
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   came off of that.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   And piggybacked off of that. And so
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   they were drawing this timeline.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   And how Judaism and
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Christianity was just a copy of all these
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   other stuff. But the reason
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   why secular scholars, if you ever
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   took a religion class in
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   secular university, that's the timeline
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   that they're going to give you. And the reason why
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   they give you that timeline is because there's
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   no way they could have known that at that period.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   If you take out
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   the supernatural. Right?
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   So, same thing with Isaiah.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   They refused to date Isaiah
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   at the time that the Bible dates him, because
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   there's no way he could have known this.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Right? So he's prophesying.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   God is prophesying about something that's going to
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   happen 70 to 100 years
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   later. Right? And it's detailed.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   He actually even names names.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Okay? So he
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   goes and he says, "Okay, this prophecy was given many
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   years before Babylonians came into power."
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Again,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   consider how laughable this
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   must have been.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   That Isaiah is a prophet
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   of this tiny little nation that's been kicked
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   around by the Midianites,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   by the Philistines, by
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Egyptians, by the Assyrians.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   And then Babylonians,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Babylonians were a
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   superpower. So,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   it could be equivalent to
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   where the U.S. has been for the last
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   100 years. Right? U.S. has been
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   a superpower, especially the last 50 to
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   60 years. U.S. is, you
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   don't mess with U.S. Right? It's kind
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   of like a little tiny country, maybe
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Burma. I don't know. I don't know any other
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   small countries. You know what I mean?
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   A prophet coming off of there saying, "We're going
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   to get you." You know? "One of these
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   days we are going to overthrow all of you, and
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   your king is going to be," you know. And
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   basically imagine when this prophecy went
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   out. And here is this prophet
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   from this tiny little nation that
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   is being kicked around by
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Assyria. You know all their kings
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   are gone. And you know they
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   are experiencing famine and all this stuff. And Isaiah
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   comes and he says, "One of these days,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   you know the Babylonians are going to
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   disappear, the Assyrians, you know our God is going to
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   destroy the Assyrians." Right?
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   But it happened.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Right? 2,000 years later,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   I mean, we're what?
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   2,700 years later.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Right? More than 2,700 years later.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   We look at now the influence
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   of Isaiah we're
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   talking about today. Right?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   What Christ has done, the fulfillment that
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   he talks about, comes and actually
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   gets fulfilled.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   But imagine how laughable it must have been at
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   that time. Right?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And he says, "What God says,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   He will do."
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   You know? So at this time, we look
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   at it and say, "Wow, yes!"
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Because we were able to be on this
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   side and see it all fulfilled and say, "Wow, our God is
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   awesome!" But imagine how that must have
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   sounded looking
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   forward. Right?
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Think about how
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   crazy some of these things that the prophecy
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   is about the coming of Christ and the end time
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   sounds to us now. Right?
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   He's going to come and all
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   the things, the description of the
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Millennial Kingdom, all this.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Oh, it's crazy! You know?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   But I bet you it didn't sound as crazy as
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   what Isaiah is saying at this time.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   The people who heard it.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   [Audience]
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   [inaudible]
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   I actually have that here somewhere.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   I forgot where I have it.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   [pages turning]
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Okay, that's actually the next one.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Okay.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Babylon is also used figuratively to describe the
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   world's rebellion against God. So,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Babylon,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   again, the physical nation, but all
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   over the scriptures, we're talking about
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Babylon and using
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   figuratively as a nation
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   or the world that rebels against God.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Right? What's another
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   city that whenever it talks about
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   debauchery that keeps coming up?
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   You always say, "Oh, Sodom and Gomorrah."
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   God would have to apologize to
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Sodom and Gomorrah. You know?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   So, when we talk about wickedness, we talk about Sodom
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   and Gomorrah. In a larger scale
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   of the world, it usually
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   uses the term Babylon.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Okay.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   [pages turning]
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Verse 8, chapter
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   13, verse 8,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   "They will be dismayed. Pangs and agony
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   will seize them.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   They will be in anguish
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   like a woman in labor." Where have you read
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   that before?
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   [pages turning]
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Can you think
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   of a...
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   You've read that before in the New Testament,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   right? At the end times?
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I think it's Matthew 24, verse 8.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   I might be off by
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   10 verses. But look at Matthew
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   24, verse 8.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Right? Somebody read it out
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   loud for us. Just so that we can confirm that
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   that's the right passage.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   [pages turning]
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Oh, I have it here. Yeah. Matthew 24, 8.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Okay.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   So it talks about at the end time it's going to be
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   like birth pains. And that's what
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   he's referring to, the end times. Right?
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   [pages turning]
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   In describing
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Babylon's judgment, so from
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   here on I'm going to go pretty quickly.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   How is it figuratively depicted?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   There's utter destruction and
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   wrath like never seen before.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   So all the judgment that God has
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   prescribed in the past is going to be nothing like
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   what's coming. Right?
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   And the primary sin of mankind is described
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   in verse 11 as pride and
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   arrogance. Right?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   God's going to humble the world.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Right? With all this technology
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   and all this stuff that we're achieving
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   that in the end all the arrogance
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   and pride is actually
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   a rebellion against God. And God's
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   going to deal with that.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   And then finally, whom will God stir up against the
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Babylonians? Okay.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   He says, what is that, in verse 17?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   [pages turning]
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Okay. "Behold, I am stirring
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   up Medes against them who have no regard
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   for silver." In other words, no amount of
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   money is going to buy you
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   peace.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   What will be the end of the city
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   of Babylon? The judgment of
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Babylon will be thorough and
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   complete, verses 19 and 20.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Okay. So in other words, when
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   that final day comes, the restoration
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   is going to be complete, but
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   also the judgment is going to be complete.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Alright. Everything that we see now
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   is partial. God's anger is
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   partial. His wrath is partial.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Right? His,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   even His grace, right,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   is partial.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   The full
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   application of it
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   is going to come when He comes a second
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   time.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Okay. Alright.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   So, if you look at the
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   questions for next week, just to kind of
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   give you a reference, I want you to focus
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   your attention.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   [pages turning]
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   This is the passage, if you
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   look at passage, chapter
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   14,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   [pages turning]
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   verse 12
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   and on, it
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   is a description of Satan,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   Lucifer.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Okay. So some of your Bibles, I think,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   actually translates a
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   section here, and translates the name
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Lucifer. Does the NASB do that?
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Anybody have the NASB,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   verse 12?
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Nobody uses NASB anymore.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Well, anyway, whether
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   you have it or not, this is
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   talking about Lucifer's fall
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   and his rebellion and God's judgment against him.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   So, I want you guys to pay more attention to that.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   And look at his rebellion
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   because his rebellion is
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   what epitomizes
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   the rebellion of mankind.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Okay. And so, the way he rebelled
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   is the way that he is trying to get his
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   disciples to rebel as well. So, try to
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   pay more attention to that. Okay.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Alright. So, if you have any questions, again,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   you know, I'll come around
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   and I'll try to answer them. Otherwise,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   take some time with your small group
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   and we'll finish with that.
