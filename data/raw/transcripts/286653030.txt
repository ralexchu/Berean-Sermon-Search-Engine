[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Formally, it's a ceremony or occasion, or what church people call an ordinance, that's
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.200]   been commanded by God that serves as a public testimony of one's commitment to Christ.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.960]   It's an outward act, a public profession of one's inward transformation and union with
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.580]   Jesus Christ.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.620]   And for many of us in this room, we are very familiar with a baptism service or a ceremony.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.840]   And many of us have probably witnessed people being baptized at some point or other.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.180]   And each and every baptism is special.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.840]   Each and every testimony has power.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   But what is baptism?
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.800]   And why do we do this?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.480]   Why do we get together to watch someone get immersed in a body of water?
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.160]   Is it merely a religious formality?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.500]   Does it in and of itself have the power to transform someone's life?
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.040]   What is baptism?
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.000]   I like to think of it as an adoption party, where the adoptive parents bring home an adopted
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   child and throw a party to celebrate this new little addition to the family.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.680]   The paperwork has been done, legal work has all been done, but the baby's been brought
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.500]   home, the journey is just beginning.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.900]   And this service, this party is an occasion to stop, reflect, and celebrate the fact that
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.400]   a life has been forever changed.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.780]   And though it may take some time to acclimate and adjust to a family, legally for all its
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.640]   intents and purposes, the child is now a son or a daughter.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.680]   The child now has a family, the child has a home, the child now belongs.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.240]   And it is a time to celebrate together as a community.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.840]   It's time for us as friends and family to meet the little one.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.120]   And a life has been forever changed.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.640]   You see, for most of us who have never been physically or socially been orphans, we can
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.980]   easily take the gift of family for granted.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.720]   I had a coworker, I used to work in Korea for six years, and I had a coworker who grew
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.640]   up as an orphan.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.900]   Her name was Jaehee.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:32.320]   And she was awesome at her job, super compassionate, super passionate for the cause of orphans.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.120]   And Jaehee, my friend, was born in 1986, so currently she is 32 years old.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.680]   And the first place she called home was an orphanage, and this was not by her choice.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.600]   She did not choose to be an orphan, but she grew up in one of the orphanages in Seoul,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.560]   South Korea.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.120]   She never knew her biological parents, and like most of us would assume or hope for in
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   a state-run orphanage, there were appearances of care, protection, education, and opportunities.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.120]   But day to day, all Jaehee remembers is the verbal abuse, sexual abuse, manipulation,
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.160]   fear and hopelessness.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.960]   And she told me of the isolation, the constant reminders that they were unwanted ones, that
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.560]   there was no place for these children to go, they were undesirable, and that there was
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.340]   no future for them, and that they were good for nothing.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.800]   And this was the message that Jaehee and the 30-some-odd girls heard almost daily from
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.640]   a facility that was to take care of these little helpless ones.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.840]   Jaehee is now currently 32 years old, and she told me that every single girl that grew
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:02.160]   up with her, 100% without exception except for her, are now all currently dead or working
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.240]   as prostitutes in the red-light districts of Seoul.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.200]   100%.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.320]   This is an isolated story, but it details a common plight for those who are orphaned
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.920]   in various parts of the world.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.400]   And without anybody to intervene, very, very few orphans grow up either healthy and/or
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   whole.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   And that's why adoption is an absolutely beautiful thing.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.840]   That strangers would decide to love, care for, and take on a child is a display, a wonderful
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.600]   display of mercy and grace.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.240]   And I believe that every single one of us in here, we understand this, even if we've
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.600]   never stepped foot into an orphanage.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.840]   You and I may not have grown up physically or socially as an orphan, but when we hear
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400]   that people have adopted a child, there's a blessing that we receive.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.240]   We're challenged, we're encouraged, and we are proud of the person that has just decided
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.680]   to take on a child.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.600]   I have people around me who've recently been in the process of adopting a child, and I
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   will always share Jaehee's story with them.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.600]   And I encourage them, and I tell them that they have just radically changed the outlook
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.120]   of a child's life.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   And I tell them how proud I am of them, and how challenged I am, and how blessed I am
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.080]   by their decision.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   So why is baptism service like an adoption party?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.160]   There are many parallels here.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:51.680]   Spiritually, every single one of us came into a very horrible and broken, damaged world.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.440]   Every single one of us in this room entered the world spiritually orphaned, dead in our
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.920]   sins and transgressions, separated from God.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   And this is not something that any one of us chose for ourselves, but this was a situation
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   that we were born into.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.040]   And to varying degrees, all of us have been horribly damaged by sin, have been permanently
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   scarred, abused, bedraggled, desperate, isolated, and terrified.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.160]   And for one reason or another, we were unwanted and undesirable.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.380]   And did you know that every single person on this planet has the following three things
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.540]   in common?
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.420]   The first one, nobody had a choice into the situation, circumstance, political environment
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.920]   into which he was born.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:47.080]   Some of us in here have had slightly better situations in regard to families and opportunities,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.020]   but we didn't choose those families.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.880]   The second thing we all have in common is every single person has been damaged and broken
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.760]   by sin.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:07.040]   And we who have been damaged tend to damage others, hurt people, hurt people, right?
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:14.160]   Literally and figuratively, we cannot help ourselves from damaging people.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.960]   And regardless of your religious background, you will likely not disagree with the fact
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.120]   that we live in a very, very damaged and broken world.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:31.840]   And that you and I add our fair share of damage and brokenness to this world.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   That's the second thing we all have in common.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.560]   Third, every single person in this room needs saving.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   Every one of us is spiritually orphaned and in need of an adoptive parent.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.960]   Some are more aware of their desperation than others.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.260]   Some are in denial.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.960]   Some are defiant, silently and not so silently saying that they have no need of saving.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.720]   I can do it on my own.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.680]   But the truth is, every single person in this room is spiritually orphaned with no hope,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.200]   no future outside of Jesus.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:18.060]   And every single one of us is completely at the mercy of the adoptive parent.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.280]   Every single person needs Jesus.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.680]   I would like to read for us John 1, 9-13.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.880]   It's up on the screen.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.480]   There was the true light which coming into the world enlightens every man.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   He was in the world and the world was made through him and the world did not know him.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.120]   He came to his own and those who were his own did not receive him.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.720]   But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, even
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.040]   to those who believe in his name, who were born not of blood, nor the will of the flesh,
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.320]   nor the will of man, but of God.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   The world was broken.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.980]   God came to this broken world in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.040]   Many in his day, however, did not receive his offer of salvation.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.600]   Perhaps they didn't feel the need for a deliverance.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.360]   Perhaps they felt morally upright and in need of no savior.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:28.680]   Perhaps what he had to offer, a restored relationship with the creator, was not what they wanted
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   out of a savior of the world.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.600]   Scripture tells us that because God loved the world, he sent his only son, that whoever
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.520]   would believe in him might be adopted as sons and daughters into the kingdom of God.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.480]   In verse 12 of this passage, we read that God has given the spiritually orphaned access
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.400]   to sonship.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.840]   He has initiated the process of spiritual adoption.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.160]   And those like you and me who are desperate and hopeless, broken and aimless, now have
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.440]   access to the kingdom of God.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.240]   And as no orphan can initiate the process of adoption, no little child can be, "I want
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.920]   to be adopted into a family in America.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.440]   I want the mom to have this.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.960]   I want the dad to have this."
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   No orphan initiates the process of adoption.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.940]   On their own, orphans cannot choose their parents.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:29.320]   In the same way, not one person in this room can initiate a relationship with God.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:37.360]   None of us can work hard enough or do enough to make ourselves more desirable or more adoptable.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.560]   It's completely God's kindness and his choice to save.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:48.820]   It's 100% God's act of mercy for us to be saved.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:55.040]   And for those of us in this room who have come to understand this lavish act of kindness,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.080]   we respond in worship, do we not?
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:07.720]   And we enjoy the gift of sonship and we enjoy the free gift of salvation.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:15.160]   And today we're celebrating the adoption of five new souls into the family of God.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   And they will be sharing about their desperation as spiritual orphans.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.480]   They will be sharing about their adjustments and their ups and downs and acclimating to
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.160]   their lives as newly adopted children of God.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:38.340]   And so for you and me, what is our role as brothers and sisters in this family of God?
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.160]   As you would with any new addition to a family, you help them adjust.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.200]   You help them grow.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.960]   You show them the ropes.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.760]   You love on them.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.640]   You be patient with them.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.260]   You include them.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:00.440]   You make them feel every right and privilege that belongs to a son or daughter.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.840]   That is our role as witnesses.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.180]   We pray for them.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:14.220]   There are things about their heavenly Father and their new family, the rights, the privileges,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:22.040]   and even responsibilities that they need to learn and adjust to.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.480]   So as we celebrate the baptism of our brothers and sisters in Christ, my prayer is that one,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   that we're reminded of the joy of our own adoption into the family.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   Two, that we're reminded of the perfect love of our heavenly Father.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:49.640]   And for those of us who may be outside looking in, if you see your need for a Savior, know
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.840]   that the invitation to sonship is open to you as well.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:03.720]   There is a parent willing to adopt you, to love on you, to heal you, to protect you,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.200]   to serve you, to bless you, and that invitation is there.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.600]   I would like to close with a verse that you may be all familiar with, John 3, 16.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Him shall not perish but have eternal life, fully enjoying every single right of a prince
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   and princess of the Creator of the universe.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.960]   Welcome to our adoption party.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.560]   Let's get this party started.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:58.440]   And let's celebrate together just the joy of God's family bringing in precious little
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   and not so little ones.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Let's pray.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.680]   Heavenly Father, we are so thankful that You've ordained this day for us to enjoy together.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:19.360]   I pray that every single person who leaves this place will be reminded of Your goodness
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:28.940]   and that reminder will serve as a great cause for us to worship in gratitude and in joy.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:40.480]   I pray that You would help us really to just be overwhelmed and humbled by the lavishness
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.600]   of Your mercy and Your grace.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   We thank You for just this afternoon for every person that has come and we pray Your will
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.080]   to be done and that our hearts would be so full after this afternoon.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   Amen.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.300]   So our first sister Irene is going to be coming up and sharing.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.480]   You can follow along in the program.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.920]   She's going to be sharing.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.960]   She's going to be baptized and then we're just going to go in order.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.120]   So when she's done, we're just going to ask our next sister to come up and share.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.160]   So can we give Irene a big round of applause as she comes up?
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.040]   Hello church family.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.960]   My name is Irene and for those of you who don't know me, I'm married to KJ and I have
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.080]   a daughter named Kaylee and I've been attending Berean on and off for about 10 years.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.640]   So before coming to know God, I considered myself a Christian because I went to church
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:39.840]   most Sundays and I tried my best to be a good person and I thought that was enough.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.640]   But I do not come from a traditional Christian family.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.040]   My dad is not a believer and my mom became a Christian as an adult.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.960]   So I didn't feel that it was absolutely necessary to commit to faith.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.140]   And also my husband is a non-believer.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.200]   I feared God but I did not share a personal relationship with Him.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.480]   So fortunately I didn't have any negative church experiences.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.240]   However, God was not a part of my daily life and at one point I stopped going to church
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   altogether.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.720]   So doubt entered my mind the more I thought about all the evil and imbalance of the world
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.400]   and especially when things were rocky in my life.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.680]   I now realize how utterly selfish and arrogant I was to think that I couldn't put my trust
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.200]   in the Lord.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.720]   I wanted to eagerly embrace this new life with God but for me accepting Christ happened
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.080]   gradually.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.320]   I received Christ in stages and with the help of a few key individuals.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:55.280]   I'm not a strong person and I know that I could never have done it without their support.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.960]   All in all it was a lengthy, emotional and eye-opening journey but I saw evidence of
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:07.480]   God unrelentingly working through people to reach me.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:16.400]   My biggest cheerleader was my dear friend Clara whom I have known since the third grade.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.840]   She invited me to her church in high school and later encouraged me to come out to Berean
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.040]   as well.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.560]   Clara is above all things very patient, generous and persistent.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.840]   Even when I politely refused many times and I couldn't find the courage to come out alone,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.780]   she never gave up.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.440]   I continued having deeper conversations with her even before she got married, throughout
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.960]   all three of her pregnancies and even now and as a result I learned so much, so much
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.080]   more about the gospel message.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.160]   Clara really provided me with the tools I needed to start transforming the way that
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.360]   I thought and accepted truth.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.080]   She pushed me to persevere, teaching me not to look to seasoned Christians but to turn
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.560]   to God alone and not to put my trust in people.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.300]   Through Berean I also met Marian who has been like a spiritual mentor and friend to me.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:24.280]   Very patiently she helped me to grow and acknowledge how deep I was in my sins and oftentimes I
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   would ask the same questions but she would show me that the answers could be found by
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.960]   turning to passages in the Bible.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.280]   I realized how much I was complaining and making excuses and focusing on how unfair
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.160]   I felt life was instead of living joyfully and with thanksgiving.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.240]   So when I began praying earnestly and seeking the Lord, I was again faced with trials that
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.040]   filled me with doubt all over again.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.800]   I would often ask, "Why is the path that God has chosen so difficult?"
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.660]   In the moment it registered to me that I desperately needed Him in my life, I was able to easily
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.080]   let go of all my selfish desires.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.960]   I genuinely repented and asked God for forgiveness many, many times before coming to this point
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   today.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.600]   Around this time when I was wrestling with the truth, several more people stepped in
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.280]   briefly to urge me to pursue a new purposeful life through Christ.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.680]   At Berean, Kaylee and I have always been so warmly welcomed and I thank all of you for
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   that.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   It was not an easy decision for me to continue coming out regularly on Sundays as KJ did
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.240]   not initially support this change.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.400]   I also have a very hard time trusting and I don't easily believe in coincidences or
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.800]   taking leaps of faith based on my feelings.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:59.960]   But when people around me at work, outside the church, at outside activities, everyone
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.160]   started approaching me all around the same period, it was definitely a bit weird.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.600]   Why had all these people suddenly taken an interest in my relationship with God?
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.760]   Why does it matter to them?
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.520]   If I believe or not.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.280]   I had been praying for God during this time to help me in my unbelief and this was his
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.360]   way.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.080]   It definitely seems as though he sent help.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.040]   Eventually I was unable to ignore everyone's efforts any longer.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.860]   And also I began to read more directly from the Bible instead of reading books or listening
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.540]   to sermons.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:43.780]   And on more than one occasion, the passage that was assigned to me that day was so perfectly
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.500]   aligned to what I needed to hear and not what I wanted to hear.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.440]   It was as though God was speaking directly to me through his word.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.980]   I could no longer deny the fact that Jesus is real.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.940]   After receiving Christ, I committed to making a more conscious effort towards living a renewed
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.260]   Christian life.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.780]   I don't wish to go into the details here, but there have been some low times when I've
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.180]   experienced personal defeat and helplessness.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.580]   But now instead of questioning why and feeling bitter and angry, I'm able to confidently
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.220]   surrender all before God.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:28.180]   I accept that I am completely powerless and will continue to fail him, but that it is
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.580]   by God's grace and mercy that I'm allowed to humbly follow the Lord.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:40.020]   I've learned that living a truly Christian life is not an easy task, and I'm aware of
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.900]   how hard it is going to be for me to change.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.420]   So it is my constant prayer to continue to run this race with a sincere heart and a genuine
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   attitude.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   Thank you.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.060]   Irene, I'm very encouraged by our testimony.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:02.100]   And now we'll be having our baptism, and I want to ask, do you understand that by entering
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.860]   and coming out of the water, you proclaim your union with Christ in his death and resurrection?
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:25.700]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.860]   Most of you probably don't know me, so hi.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:33.180]   My name is Janet Yeo, and I am from Los Angeles, California, and will be a fourth year at UCI
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.180]   this upcoming fall.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.860]   Just a little bit more about me.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.060]   I am number three of four siblings.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.980]   I like to find new places to eat.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.600]   I love all sports, and I'm on the UCI women's golf team.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.060]   I grew up in the church, so it was very easy for me to follow the motions of a Christian.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.460]   I knew the basic concepts of Christianity, like God loves you or God is sovereign, and
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.420]   many more.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.860]   Despite knowing these basic truths, I did not truly believe in them.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.620]   I thought that praying before my meals, being well-behaved, and going to Sunday service
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.620]   were the only marks of a solid Christian.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:18.740]   This thought process did not upset me or cause any harm until my junior year of high school.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.420]   I was going through membership classes at my home church, and during the final step,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.700]   an interview with the pastor, my pastor asked me a simple question, "What is the gospel?"
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.580]   A question that is so fundamental to Christianity, and yet it left me speechless.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.500]   This interview was traumatic that instead of dealing with it head on, I just put it
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.660]   off to the side and carried on with my life.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:46.060]   This same year was also a very crucial part in my golf career, because it was when everyone
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.700]   started getting recruited and committing to colleges to play.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:56.340]   I started golf at 13, which is a relatively young age to begin the sport, so because of
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.260]   my lack of experience, it was very difficult for me to get any offer to any name value,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.500]   let alone any university.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.700]   Then a school that I have never, ever heard of contacted me and offered me a full ride,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.620]   the University of Northern Colorado, UNC for short.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.460]   So needless to say, I decided to go there.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.940]   UNC was located in Greeley.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.260]   In the midst of cornfields and plains, Greeley is no spectacular town.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:26.540]   It was pretty much the complete opposite of home in Los Angeles.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.860]   Adjusting to college life alone was challenging, but having to do it in another state was completely
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.260]   out of my comfort zone.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.820]   There were not many churches nearby, and the one I attended was really big, so community
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.320]   was difficult to come by.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.220]   In Colorado, I was too far from home, in need of community, and not playing good golf.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.740]   I was feeling unconfident about my game and almost ready to quit on trying to pursue a
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.740]   career.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.060]   My faith was conditional and based off my golf performance.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.220]   I would tell myself that I'm playing to glorify God, but in my heart, I knew I was just looking
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.100]   for approval and praise from those around me.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.580]   My pride consumed my thoughts, making me think that I alone was doing everything and God
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.300]   was someone who was not in control and orchestrating my life.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.940]   I wanted to transfer to a different school, so I would often come to God in anger and
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.260]   frustration saying, "Why am I here?
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.180]   Why can't I go to another school like her?" and other questions while holding so much
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.100]   bitterness in my heart.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   I questioned whether or not God loved me and if He was really listening to my prayers.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.460]   But while in Colorado, God was gradually softening my heart and heart by allowing me to understand
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.020]   the importance of Scripture, how much He actually does love me, and what it means to glorify
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.180]   Him.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.340]   One verse that stuck out to me during the time was Philippians 3.8, "Indeed, I count
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.300]   everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:57.020]   For His sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.860]   that I may gain Christ."
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.380]   This verse is one of the many that helped me realize that the only testament of God's
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.660]   love that I need in my life is that God sent His only Son to die for me.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.980]   This truth was so overwhelming to me because God still chose to love me even though I failed
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.940]   and neglected Him all these years.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.180]   Understanding this truth made me realize how selfish my desires were and allowed me to
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.300]   come before God in repentance.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.220]   He had to strip me of all my comforts in order to allow me to truly fix my eyes on Him.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:36.740]   This was a very liberating truth that allowed me to see my situation in a different light.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.420]   God's sovereignty was just head knowledge, but I finally understood what this truth actually
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.420]   means.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.660]   By trusting in His providence, He allowed me to have the courage to leave Colorado and
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.120]   my team without any set plans.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.940]   As a worrywart, uncertainty was something that I absolutely despised, so this was a
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.940]   really big step for me.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.020]   But God opened up doors for me to come to Irvine to play golf at UCI in the middle of
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.600]   my sophomore year.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.080]   I was able to find a place to live, get along with my teammates, and also find a great church
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.040]   that teaches me how to cultivate my faith through scripture.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.760]   This past year and a half at UCI has been such a blessing, and I am so undeserving to
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.100]   receive this kind of love.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.360]   As my final year of college approaches, there are so many unknowns and events that I wish
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.360]   I could control.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.320]   I have no idea where I will be or how I am going to pursue a professional golf career,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.780]   but by trusting in His faithfulness and sovereignty, I am confident that He will provide in every
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:37.000]   stage of my life for His glory.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.720]   God has showered me with mercy and graced me on measures throughout my life, but most
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.040]   importantly He has given me the assurance of my salvation and citizenship in Heaven.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   Thank you.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.280]   Janet, do you understand that by entering and coming out of the water, you proclaim
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.440]   your union with Christ in His death and resurrection?
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:28:01.320]   I baptize you now in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   Amen.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   I will now ask you to rise.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.120]   What's up?
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.600]   I'm Janet, and I'm a senior at UCI.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.500]   I'm from South Pasadena and grew up going to a huge Korean American church all my life.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.600]   When I was in the sixth grade, I went to a church retreat, and that was where I first
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   got an understanding of who Jesus is.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.480]   But years passed, and I still acknowledge God, but I lived like I didn't believe in
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   Him.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.960]   I loved that I was good at lying, and I liked the power I felt from disobeying my parents.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.480]   That confession in sixth grade didn't change me.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.240]   Instead, I got better at using my passionate personality for selfish and prideful reasons,
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.200]   for things that gave me a false sense of power and control.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.360]   I only thought about God before meals and before bed, because I treated faith like a
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.200]   superstition.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.560]   I would ask God for things like health for my family, a successful future, and other
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.800]   blessings.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.000]   And not that those things are bad, but by asking for those things, I don't think it
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.820]   was the same as asking for Him.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.640]   So that's why I'm stepping into university.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.440]   I still struggle with my sin.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.880]   I hated how easy it was to let wrongdoings towards me hinder the way I loved others.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   But I felt like that was just my nature.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.800]   I thought there was no solution to how imperfect I was, but it never crossed my mind that the
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.000]   solution required something bigger than me.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.520]   I questioned numerous times why I was the way I was, and I struggled deeply with my
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.680]   inability to be a good person all the time, because I didn't have an example.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   I knew no one who I could trust to always show me the way and always be right.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.000]   And for the first time, I read the Bible without it feeling like a chore.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.140]   I read fervently because I was hungry to know the truth.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.560]   And from reading, I finally understood the beauty of mercy.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.040]   Mercy from a God who forgives as easily as He loves us.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.600]   God showed me who He was, characteristic by characteristic, through His Word, and that
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.520]   there's only perfection in Him, and a peace of mind that comes only from Him.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.200]   And I admitted to myself that I need Him.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.920]   I'm not choosing to be a Christian because there are times when it might be convenient
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.160]   to have a religion.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.720]   I think that's actually unfair to God.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.520]   I made that choice because I need Him all the time, because He's everything good, and
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.760]   there are sins and problems that plague us that we don't know how to fix, but God can.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.840]   That year, I said to myself that I sincerely want to try to be like Christ.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.160]   I know that Christians are not exempt from temptations, but I also know enough about
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.040]   God to have faith that He would help me with them.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.280]   And that was when I started to be transformed little by little.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:00.800]   Early this year, one of my loved ones passed away, and shortly after, I started having
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.760]   serious health problems.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:09.840]   Frankly, I felt trapped in my body for months, like a bird in a cage, a restless captive
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.920]   awaiting freedom.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:18.040]   The physical pain and the pain it caused me psychologically, in addition to grief, was
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:25.880]   so deep and sharp, it made it hard to breathe, and it hurt to just think about the next day.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.320]   Just like Jonah, I felt like I was too far out of God's reach, hurled into the very heart
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.360]   of the seas, yet I tried to look again and again for Him.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.440]   In the darkest moments when I felt my will to live evaporating into the atmosphere, God
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.480]   reminded me patiently to remember Him, to look at the cross, to just look at Jesus hanging
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.440]   there for me.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.600]   He was my lighthouse.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   As small as it was, I still struggled to just turn my face to it.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.240]   But how sweet my peace was when I found the strength to lift my eyes to Him, how senseless
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.840]   my joy was in the midst of my pain.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.400]   Though I lay down for months, I felt like my strength was renewed, like I could run
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.840]   and not grow weary.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.440]   Thinking about Christ and His sacrifice for me was the only way out.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.840]   And like the way a mother hen draws her chicks under her wing, He gathered me in all my pieces
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:28.720]   to Him and gave me a comfort that no one else could offer.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.740]   He reminded me as I lay down, resting day in and day out, that no matter the state of
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.200]   my body and my inability to tear away from it, nothing could change the fact that He
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.800]   died for me and that He gave up His own body for me.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.560]   He showed me that our condition in life doesn't determine or change His goodness, but it's
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   because of our role as followers of Christ that we never have to doubt His goodness.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.600]   So even if God wanted to take away my legs, or if He wanted me to let go of my carefully
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.720]   thought plans for the future, or if He wanted me to have surgery, I was truly okay with
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   that because I know He's got the best plans for me, plans to prosper me and give me hope.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:16.480]   His love was and is able to seep down into the nearest cracks of any broken and hurting
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.080]   heart and seal it if we just let it.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.080]   I realized that I was never too far out of His sight.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.480]   I felt His arm reach down into the deepest of pits where I would often find myself to
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.640]   be and pull me out in His hand.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   I learned that this God who I used to pray to out of ritualism is a God who loved me
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.960]   so ardently He put aside all the humiliation, pain and betrayal He experienced to die for
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:48.920]   me and this God is a God who was and will always be relentlessly faithful.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:54.000]   He didn't grow tired of me just as it says in Isaiah 40, and instead He gave me strength
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.720]   when I had none.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   He understood me when no one could and He is my reason to live.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.640]   It physically hurt to sit, stand, study, things we do every day and don't give a second thought
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.720]   to.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.880]   And I felt my youth is being threatened to be taken away.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.320]   But deeper than that feeling in the core of my heart I knew that God was there and that's
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.560]   all I needed to know.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.720]   Peace settled beautifully in my heart from knowing that if Christ can overcome death
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.600]   and is alive today and if the suffering He endured couldn't stop Him from getting on
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.280]   that cross for me then surely He can handle my suffering.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.800]   So even though I'm still in the process of recovering and I don't know what the future
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.680]   holds for my health that is why for Christ's sake I delight in weaknesses, in hardships
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.460]   and in difficulties.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.400]   For when I am weak then I am strong.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.020]   This is the power of Christ I felt as I lay immobile, the love that brought a new kind
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:35:00.040]   of tears to my eyes and the hope I have within my soul forever.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.960]   To the God who is the ultimate physician yet offers an eternal hope and perfect healing
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.920]   for ourselves and for this broken world.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:14.120]   To the one who loves us beyond comprehension and gave His only son for us I can only say
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   hallelujah.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   Thank you.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:22.140]   Before we enter the water I'd like to ask you that you understand that by entering the
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:27.000]   water and coming out reclaim your union with Christ in His death and resurrection.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:48.400]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:55.040]   Hey everybody, my name is Garrett Kleiser, been at Berean since May and I'm getting baptized
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:02.960]   with my beautiful wife Rachel.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.780]   I'd first like to start off by stating that I've never given my testimony, I've never
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.660]   wanted to give it.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.000]   The idea of being vulnerable and open about my past is something that I've dreaded for
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   a long time.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.840]   The equal parts shame, guilt, disgust would be the common theme and the fear of being
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.480]   judged for my actions would prevent me from opening up about who I was and who I am now.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.580]   Well that's how I used to feel and then I realized I was looking at it all wrong.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.940]   In my head I was putting more of the spotlight on my past transgressions rather than keeping
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:41.240]   the spotlight on the one who delivered me from them.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.080]   When I think about giving my testimony now, it's no longer fear or shame or disgust that
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.480]   I have, but instead joy.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.920]   Joy because I no longer have the guilt of my past sins hanging over my head.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.880]   Joy because before the foundations of the earth were made, God chose me to be His adopted
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.760]   son through Jesus Christ.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.420]   Joy because my God humbled himself to come down from His throne and become a man, born
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.520]   to die and rise again so that a sinner like myself can be reconciled with Him.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:16.160]   That's what makes me excited to share about what God has delivered me from, even though
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.280]   I still absolutely hate being up here and speaking to you guys.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.240]   Ever since I can remember, church was a part of my life.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.040]   Both of my parents were regular church goers since before I was born, so naturally I was
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.080]   brought up in the church.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.520]   That meant being at church a minimum of three times a week, being locked in our room so
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:42.280]   our parents could have study group in the living room uninterrupted, VBS, church camp,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.320]   meetings about VBS and church camp.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.720]   It's not a stretch to say that I grew tired of church at an early age, but one thing I
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.360]   remember happened at church camp.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.520]   It was really the first time that I ever experienced an altar call.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.200]   We're on the last night around the campfire.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.000]   They called it like an afterglow or something like that.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.880]   The youth group leaders asked the kids if they wanted to go to heaven.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.720]   Apparently in my head, all one had to do to get to heaven was to pray and ask Jesus into
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.920]   your heart and you're going to be saved.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.920]   So I did.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.200]   I raised my hand and stood up along with every other kid at the camp and seemed and prayed
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.560]   the sinner's prayer.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.400]   I truly thought that that's what I needed to do in order to get to heaven, was to be
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   saved.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.920]   Well into my adult years, if you asked me at 24 if I was a Christian, I would have told
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:38.520]   you yes, all because of that one time at sixth grade I raised my hand.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:45.640]   Most of my adult years were mired in a vat of sexual immorality, drug use, alcohol abuse,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.240]   carousing, pretty much any other vice one could think of.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.280]   I was a man that was controlled by my lust and my selfish desires.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.560]   I was on a constant mission to gratify whatever passion I was feeling at that moment.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.520]   I won't go into much detail about this because I don't think you need a clearer picture when
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.400]   you think about the previously mentioned sins and also because my mom and mother-in-law
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:15.240]   are right there.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.140]   But just know that I was very involved in that lifestyle and I began to depend on them
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.240]   just to cope with life.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.560]   I had nothing to do with God, not because I resented him, but because I didn't care
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.720]   about him.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.360]   I relied on my sinner's prayer back in sixth grade whenever I felt guilty about what I
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.080]   was doing and I would offer up a quick half-hearted prayer saying I was sorry, thinking that brought
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.440]   me back into God's good graces, only to continue with my sinful lifestyle the moment the opportunity
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.880]   presented itself.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.000]   When I got out of the Army, I was diagnosed as 60% disabled because of my post-traumatic
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.880]   stress disorder from my time in combat.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.840]   And I'd used that diagnosis as an excuse for my behavior.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.480]   It was a crutch in my mind to justify my sinful lifestyle.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.680]   This way of living carried on with me until just a few years back, and that's when I started
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.400]   to become unsettled inside.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.760]   A few years ago, questions started popping up into my head, like the same questions over
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.520]   and over again, like am I really a Christian, do I really believe in Jesus Christ, am I
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   really saved?
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.360]   And my heart would answer no.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.720]   You know that feeling, that just, that deep feeling where you're just like, no, you're
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   not.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.000]   And my head would rage against that, saying, well, what about sixth grade camp?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.440]   You know, you're just backsliding.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.040]   It's okay, you're just going through a rough patch.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.640]   But my heart, I knew it was a lie.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.240]   I decided I was going to do things right from there on out, that I was going to choose God,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.600]   that somehow I was going to live my life away that merited forgiveness from Him.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.760]   I grew up in a church that always taught that we choose to believe in God.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.080]   And that is the faith that brings us salvation.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.280]   I hated the way Reformed churches would preach about election.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.040]   I thought it was unfair, unjust, and arrogant.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.720]   And the more I studied to disprove that doctrine, the more it made sense, and the more it terrified
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   me.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.440]   It scared me because I began to ask the question, like, oh, am I chosen, did God choose me?
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.200]   To be honest, I battled with that question for a few years, arguing with myself about
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.760]   choosing God, or did He choose me?
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   It wasn't until venturing down a YouTube rabbit hole that I came across a sermon by Paul Washer.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   And one quote from that teaching stuck with me.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.360]   It said, "You can't claim to have a supernatural experience with the Almighty God of the universe
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.200]   and not be fundamentally transformed by it."
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.720]   And that hit me like a ton of bricks.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.320]   I realized that I was lying to myself about my belief in Jesus this entire time.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.400]   To drive the point home even further, one of the first things I read when I finished
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.040]   the teaching was 1 John 1.4.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.600]   It says, "The one who says I have come to know Him and does not keep His commandments
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.240]   is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.160]   That was the moment I realized how sinful I was.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.200]   It was like all my transgressions were planted right in front of my face.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.120]   I realized that I'd been living a lie my entire life, claiming to know Christ but bearing
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.880]   rotten fruit.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.320]   I read through each gospel day after day, and a word just kept popping off the page
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   on me.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   It was "repent."
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.240]   And I didn't even know what repentance meant.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.800]   I thought I was just asking for forgiveness.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:33.240]   I had no idea that it was a gift from God, and I didn't know, and I had no idea what
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.900]   the cost of it was.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.680]   It was then that I asked the Lord to forgive me.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.360]   I began rattling off sins from that very day and sins from years past.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.600]   I wanted to be cleansed, I wanted to get rid of all this stuff that I saw as filth in my
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:55.440]   life, that I needed to be restored, I needed peace, I needed Jesus Christ.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.320]   Since that day, the vices that once had a stranglehold on me are no more.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.800]   I'm no longer in bondage to immorality, drugs, or alcohol.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.320]   I'm set free by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.120]   I have learned what it is to live a life of repentance.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.760]   I have a desire to read God's Word.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.400]   I have a desire to become a better husband to my beautiful wife.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.160]   I have a desire to be more like Christ with each passing day.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.200]   I have assurance in my faith, knowing that God put eternity in my heart and He intercedes
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.400]   for me with groanings too deep for words, and that He chose me to worship Him, knowing
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.320]   that He will be faithful to complete the work that He started in me.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   Thank you.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.320]   All right, Gary, thank you.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:41.960]   I want to ask that you understand by entering into this water, coming out, you proclaim
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.320]   your union with Christ in His death and resurrection.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:52.520]   Baptize you now in the name of the Father, the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.320]   Okay, bend your nose.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   Hi, guys.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320]   I'm Rachel.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.080]   I'm Garrett's wife.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:09.160]   We've been coming since May, so I'm just going to get into this.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.920]   So I was raised as a Catholic.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.000]   From the time I was a little girl, my sister and I would attend catechism and took communion
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   every week, every Sunday.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.880]   We were taught the worship of saints and Mary, the confessions of our sins to a priest, and
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.740]   how to pray the rosary.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:35.380]   My whole idea of faith revolved around performing these religious acts for a distant God that
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.920]   did not have any part in my life.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:46.700]   I slowly drifted in and out of church, and with it, my morality.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.420]   It was not until I was 18 years old when I was invited to a Christian church close to
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.780]   where I attended high school.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.700]   For the most part, I was only interested in meeting new friends, during high school ministry
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:02.340]   events, serving in the cafe, and not to mention the worship music was like being at a rock
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.340]   concert.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:09.140]   But regardless, this was the first time I heard the message of the gospel.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:15.060]   The church was a relatively young church and seemed to do altar calls every other weekend.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.980]   And I saw a wave and wave of young people getting saved, and I wanted in.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:25.740]   So I went forward during an altar call one weekend and accepted Jesus Christ into my
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:31.300]   heart, and several months later was baptized in front of the entire congregation.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:37.340]   In that moment, I believed I was saved and wholeheartedly subscribed to the notion, "once
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.260]   saved, always saved."
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:50.420]   But what did that so-called redeemed life look for me?
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:55.820]   2021 ushered in a new era of unrestricted pursuit of pleasure.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:02.660]   My young adult years were wrought with sexual immorality, drug and alcohol use, and its
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:10.700]   consequences, and indulging in every other self-serving thing I could get my hands on.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:17.860]   I would give myself over to my lust each day, to my boyfriend, to alcohol, to my job, or
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.980]   the shows that I took gratification in.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.300]   And those things became the object of my affection, my own little gods that I worshipped.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.060]   I was content in my sin and reveling in it.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:36.180]   Then I would make it to Sunday service where I would feel renewed.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:40.380]   And at that time, I believed if I prayed for forgiveness for the sins of that day, I would
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:46.220]   be forgiven, only to sin again and pray for forgiveness.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.580]   And it was like a constant revolving door.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.980]   And I did not know true repentance, and I would not know it until ten years after I
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.020]   was baptized.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:04.140]   That is the person I was, defiling the place of God in my drunkenness from the night before,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.340]   relegating him to Sunday's amusement.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.180]   I cleaned up my act a bit over time.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:16.180]   My partying days faded, and I held a steady job as an RN, all while still attending church.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:21.500]   Then I met a wonderful man who came from a strong Christian household, who seventeen
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.700]   short months later became my husband.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:31.420]   It became even more apparent in my short married life that I didn't understand my purpose.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.900]   I could not understand why I was not being fulfilled.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.860]   And I believed that God would bless our marriage, yet I was still living in sin daily and found
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.500]   no struggle in it.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.900]   I cried on several nights, praying for answers, mostly out of desperation.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.940]   And I began to ask myself if I even knew God or do I just know about him.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.260]   And if I don't know him, am I a stranger to him?
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:48:00.100]   And in February, I accepted an invitation by my mother-in-law to go to a women's retreat
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.500]   at our church.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.460]   At this time, we had not been attending church regularly since we were still searching for
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.460]   one.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.260]   I prayed that night that the Holy Spirit would lead us to a church and that God would provide
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.020]   us a place where we would find purpose for our marriage and fellowship.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.920]   In May, we started coming here and it was not out of coincidence we were meant to be
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.860]   here at this moment.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:29.340]   Pastor Peter was preaching out of Romans 13, 11 through 14, his sermon entitled "Time
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.340]   to be Awake."
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.740]   I remember that day vividly.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.700]   He said something that struck the very core of my heart.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.460]   He said, "Christianity was never meant to be a half-hearted commitment.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.760]   The very idea of worshipping God requires a pouring out of our hearts."
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.620]   He read from Deuteronomy 4, 29, "But from there you will seek the Lord your God and
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:56.740]   you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul."
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:03.660]   He ended with this exhortation, and I think he was banging on the pulpit.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.060]   There is no healing outside of Christ.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.580]   There is no fruit outside of Christ.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.660]   There is no life outside of Christ.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.900]   This was my answer.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.300]   Everything I believed about my faith was wrong.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.020]   Everything I believed to be righteous was wrong.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:25.500]   And I began reading desperate, searching Christ, combing the Word for answers.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.180]   The more I read the Word, the more my sin was revealed to me, and I spent the next couple
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:33.940]   of nights sleepless, tossing and turning in despair over my sin.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:40.580]   And every time I closed my eyes, the sins of my past and the sins I thought I had buried
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:47.460]   deep down just came crashing down on me, and I just felt unable to breathe, and I was completely
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.500]   undone.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:56.340]   I felt that God was talking to me and I was finally listening.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.460]   He knew all my sin and shame, and all I could do was cry out to the Father for forgiveness,
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.460]   and I repented.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.500]   I knew then that my time of living as a slave to sin was over.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:13.220]   It was time to live my salvation the way it was purposed, to live life the complete opposite
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.600]   of how I was living.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:21.660]   And I deserved eternal damnation, but in His great mercy, God chose me, a sinner, and the
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:26.180]   object of His wrath to be made righteous through the blood of His Son.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:32.940]   Not only was I forgiven, but adopted into the family of Christ.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:38.780]   That night I was filled with both sorrow of the weight of my sin, but also immense joy.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.540]   I had finally begun to realize my treasure and the richness in Christ.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.460]   Before that day and before coming to Breen, I was greatly deceived by the quality of my
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.060]   faith.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:57.180]   I knew about God but lacked fruit and obedience, and I was eternally lost, a useless corpse.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.660]   And since that day, I have experienced freedom from sin, and now I am living a life of repentance
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.340]   and regeneration.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.660]   My new life calls me to surrender everything in obedience.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:12.740]   I'm not going to lie, it has been a painful process, because I have lost things of the
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:18.100]   world I had called home for so long—friends, partying, TV shows.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:23.600]   And I am daily reminded that Christianity was never meant to be a half-hearted commitment.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.460]   My mind is being renewed by the word of God daily as I continue to search after Him with
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.180]   all my heart and all my soul.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:34.260]   I desire to be a better wife to my husband, to embrace fellowship, and to be bold and
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.980]   courageous to speak about my new life in the hope that God would be glorified through it
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.700]   all.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.820]   My testimony is not yet complete as God is still at work and continues to do great things
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.880]   in my life for His glory.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:53.140]   And I can now say with humble assurance that the Almighty God grabbed hold of me and showed
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.180]   me the ugliness and filth of my sin.
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:02.140]   The same God that powers the sun and spoke the world into existence took mercy on me
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.820]   and desires for me to be reconciled to Him and worship Him for eternity.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:12.660]   I am that product of that transforming power, so I thank you, Jesus, for His grace on me.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.180]   Thank you.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:21.360]   >> Okay, Rachel, do you understand that by entering the water and coming out, you proclaim
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.080]   your union with Christ in His death and resurrection?
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:31.560]   I baptize you now in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.360]   Go ahead and pinch your nose.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.200]   [applause]
