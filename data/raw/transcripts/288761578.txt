[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   We're going to be looking in the book of Mark, chapter 10, verse 17.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:20.720]   If you would please turn there with me.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.040]   Mark 10, verse 17, and we'll read till verse 22.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.240]   As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to him and knelt before him and asked
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.000]   him, "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.640]   And Jesus said to me, "Why do you call me good?
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.920]   No one is good except God alone.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   You know the commandments.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   Do not murder.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   Do not steal.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.600]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   Do not defraud.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.240]   Honor your father and mother."
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.800]   And he said to him, "Teacher, I've kept all these things from my youth up."
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.040]   Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, "One thing you lack.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.960]   Go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.940]   And come, follow me."
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.040]   But at these words, he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.120]   much property.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   Would you bow your heads in prayer with me?
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.720]   Dear God, as we look into your word today, we marvel at it because we know this is your
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720]   word.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.120]   Father, thank you for the privilege that we have.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.480]   God, help us to treat it as such.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.880]   Let this be instructive to our souls.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.120]   And Father, would this be something that lasts as the Holy Spirit carries it into the depths
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   of our hearts.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.960]   Well the story of the rich young ruler is a common one, and it has to do with works
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   salvation.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.280]   So I'll get that out right in the front.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.360]   Works salvation.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.980]   And the nature of true discipleship.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.560]   So if you've ever heard this story, which likelihood of you having heard it is pretty
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   high, that's what it's about.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.240]   It's about following Jesus as his disciple, which is actually synonymous as to what it
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   means to be a Christian.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.920]   And so to follow Christ, it requires us not to work out our salvation in a way where we
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.720]   would be working, doing, performing to receive it, but instead that our salvation is bought
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   by the blood of Christ and given to us freely through the work of Jesus.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.560]   And most of us know this, but today what I'm hoping to take a look at this passage and
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.080]   see is how this kind of living, the kind of living that this rich young ruler lived, might
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.880]   be closer to even us as Christians, might be prone to follow.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.240]   It threatens our ability to live following Jesus on a day-to-day basis, and it also threatens
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.600]   the joy that we might have in following him as well.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.800]   So if you look down at the passage in verse 17 through 22, it kind of pinballs back and
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   forth from here's the rich young ruler, then Jesus, then rich young ruler, then Jesus,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.080]   then rich young ruler.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.840]   So in verse 17, if you look there, it says that this man runs up to him and he says this,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.320]   "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.720]   So he's asking this deep, profound question, "How can I get salvation?"
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.640]   And then in verse 18, Jesus responds to that, he says, "Why do you call me good?"
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   Which is a weird question.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.640]   It's a very strange question.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.000]   Jesus tends to do this every once in a while.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Someone will come up with this, I mean, we would say this was a great question, right?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.440]   What must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   And we just kind of do a double-take on Jesus.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Why do you call me good?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.760]   Like, why does he focus on this title that this man has given to him?
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.120]   And he says, "No one is good except God alone."
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.360]   And then Jesus says, "You know the commandments, do not murder."
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.740]   And he continues to go and he lists out six different commandments.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.760]   And then this man says, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up."
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:12.180]   And then verse 21, it says that Jesus looks at him, that he loves him.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.100]   And he says to him, "Well, you're lacking one thing.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.060]   Great, you've been a moral guy.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.340]   Great, you've upheld the law, but you lack one thing.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.300]   Go and sell everything that you have and then come and follow me."
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.620]   At those words, that's when the man walks away with his head hung because he was unwilling
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.620]   to do that.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.780]   We're going to two points.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.940]   And after the two points, we're going to hit an application.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.540]   This is our first point today.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.660]   First, good intentions and heartfelt fervor are not enough to truly follow Christ.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.660]   Good intentions and heartfelt fervor are not enough to truly follow Christ.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.740]   We could have good intentions.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.820]   We could have a deep desire of religious things and even the things of God, but that's not
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   enough.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   That's what we'll see.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.020]   Now, it says in verse 17 that Jesus was setting out on a journey.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.640]   And this journey that is happening here is a very specific one.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.260]   This is the journey to the cross, which is going to be found in chapter 11 of Mark.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.180]   Jesus has been doing all this ministry in the first 11 chapters of Mark.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.740]   And in the book of Mark, if you're familiar with it, the word that comes up a lot is the
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.280]   word immediately.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.460]   And so it says immediately Jesus did this, and he got up and he did this, and he woke
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.580]   up and he did this.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.700]   And it says that he's just kind of going all over the place.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.520]   And it's a very fast-paced, action-packed gospel.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.980]   And so with that, if we kind of think about what happens beyond chapter 11 is it kind
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.420]   of grinds to a screeching halt.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.780]   Jesus all of a sudden finds himself in Jerusalem, and then the last days play out very, very
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.780]   slowly.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.220]   And so in chapter 10, verse 17, it says he's setting out on a journey, specifically talking
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.180]   about that journey to Jerusalem, to the cross, where he'll complete what he came to the earth
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.180]   to do.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.380]   And this is where we find this encounter with the rich young ruler.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.180]   Now this account in Mark, if you're wondering, why is he called the rich young ruler?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.260]   That should be a question as you kind of read through this.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.900]   This says something, it says nothing about him being young, and it says nothing about
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.280]   him being a ruler.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.140]   It says everything about him being rich.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.900]   But you'll see it in the account of Matthew that he is considered a young man, and he's
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.100]   labeled young, young, young multiple times.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.740]   It's seen as important there.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.420]   We won't go into why.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.980]   And then in Luke, it says that he's a ruler.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.580]   It defines his political status.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.420]   Now what's interesting about Luke's account is that as a ruler, it's strange to find a
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.360]   ruler who is so young as this man.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.180]   And the reason why that's interesting is because it's not a position easily given to a young
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.180]   person.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.600]   It'd be given to older, wiser, seasoned people, people who have been kind of approved by the
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.560]   leadership of the synagogue.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   This was a ruler of a synagogue, by the way.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   He probably held the esteem of all these rulers, of the people that were above him.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600]   And just because he was rich, it doesn't mean that he could just buy this position.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.080]   So he didn't do that either.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.160]   This was a man held in high regard by society for his religious affections.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.240]   And now as Jesus is preparing for his final journey to the cross, this guy comes running
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.920]   up to him, and what we would think initially is that this is a perfect candidate for the
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   kingdom of God.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   Who would think that?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.480]   This is a man who has good intentions, and we know this by some clues in Scripture.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.720]   And we'll go through a few of them.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.640]   In verse 17, it says that this man ran up to Jesus.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   That shows desperation.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   That shows urgency.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.640]   Because respectable, honorable, self-respecting, noble men didn't run during times like this.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.360]   If you've ever heard of the parable of the prodigal son, you're going to see that the
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.400]   father, upon seeing his prodigal son return from a distance, he hikes up his robes, and
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.360]   then he runs through the town where everyone can see him.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.480]   Communities are probably listening to this and gasping.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.680]   Respectable men didn't run.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   And so it shows something about this man.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   He is desperate.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.000]   He is urgent.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.480]   There's also a sense of humility here.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.760]   Next it says not only that this man ran up to him, but that he knelt before him.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.000]   Reverent and humble.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.880]   Now this is a rich man.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.680]   And this is a ruler.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   And this is a hierarchical community.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.300]   This isn't something that should happen, but in a culture like this, this is seen then
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.560]   as a very radical, drastic action by this rich young man.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.800]   This was a sign of great respect.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.720]   Continuing in verse 17, it says that he runs up, he kneels, and then he asks.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.760]   By the way, whenever you see a bunch of verbs like this kind of describing an encounter,
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.400]   you should kind of perk your attention up because you want to see why is he, especially
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.040]   in a book like Mark where everything is so fast, very deliberate about these things.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.920]   He runs, he kneels, and then he asks.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.560]   What does asking show about this man?
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.320]   Well, he's inquisitive and hungry.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.560]   This is the student that every teacher loves.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.960]   If you've ever been a small group leader, this is like your favorite small group kid.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   This is the one.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:36.400]   He asks great questions, profound questions even, deep thinker, wants the right things.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.040]   It also says in verse 17 that this man addresses Jesus as good teacher.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:48.400]   That's another sign that he's ready to learn, that he's ready to give his attention to Jesus.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.680]   Fifthly, in verse 17, it says that he asks this question, "What must I do to inherit
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   eternal life?"
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.440]   There's a depth to that question.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.520]   You would think that this young man is well on his way to eternal life already, right?
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.500]   He's a synagogue ruler.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:11.640]   You would think that he's done enough, but he understands something more and he wants
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.560]   more and he's hungering for more.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.200]   So he asks that question, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.760]   Shouldn't he be someone that you go to to ask that question?
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.420]   There's something going on with him.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:30.860]   And then in verse 20, after Jesus answers him and says, "Hey, here are six commandments.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.860]   Keep those.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.020]   That's what you must do to inherit eternal life."
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.180]   It says that he responds in this manner, "I have kept all these things from my youth."
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:43.220]   Now at first glance, that might make you feel like, "Man, that's kind of hypocritical.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220]   That sounds a little bit arrogant.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.380]   How can you say that?"
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.780]   And there is hypocrisy and arrogance here, but it's not overt.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.500]   It's not malicious intent.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.980]   This is actually something that he believes he's done.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.620]   He's genuine in his understanding of like, "I've really kept to this law."
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.820]   This was a morally upright man.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.060]   How else do we know that this man was genuine in heart?
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.380]   Well, in verse 21, this is probably the best evidence of it.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.700]   In verse 21, it says, "Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him," and
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.660]   then Jesus says his thing.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.980]   Jesus wouldn't look upon blatant hypocrisy with this kind of compassion and love.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.500]   And we know that in Matthew chapter 23, if you know that chapter.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.540]   I have a passage for you, but we're going to skip it for time sake.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.940]   But these are the woes to the Pharisees.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.620]   And these Pharisees, Jesus encounters them and says, "Woe is you.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.620]   Woe is you.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.740]   Woe is you because you are so religious.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.660]   You are so hypocritical.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.100]   You teach, but you do not receive what you teach.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.360]   You do not live what you're telling all these people to do.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.780]   You are placing burdens on people.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.100]   You are whitewashed tombs."
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.540]   He says all this damning stuff to them.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.140]   But to this man, there is no such thing.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:04.380]   Jesus looks at him, looks at him, and he loves him.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.980]   There's a level of compassion that Jesus has upon this man because this is a genuine man
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.740]   before him.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.500]   This man was not in blatant hypocrisy trying to puff himself up.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.620]   Unfortunately this is the only time in Mark where it says that Jesus looks at someone
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.560]   and loves them.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.100]   All appearances indicate that this is a sincere man, that he really wants to get into the
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   kingdom of God.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:39.580]   And if I were to ask you that question today, like who wants to go to heaven after they
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   die?
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.740]   Or if we were to ask ourselves that question right now, like this is a real question for
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.740]   us, right?
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.900]   What must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:58.300]   We can be genuine at heart in desire, in a depth of wanting what this question is asking,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.860]   and yet it's not enough to truly follow Jesus.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:08.660]   It's scary because we've grown so accustomed to knowing what religious leaders look like,
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.660]   right?
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660]   Pharisees.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.660]   We shouldn't look like them.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.660]   Hypocrisy and things like that.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.500]   This is scary for us because this man is a religious leader who's genuine and still isn't
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.460]   making it into the kingdom of God.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.780]   We can be like this.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.420]   We can be genuine in hunger.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   We can be genuine in wanting to learn.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.580]   We can be genuine in the pursuit of truth.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:35.800]   We can be genuine in desire, but we might still fall into this category of good intentions
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:44.200]   and heartfelt fervor that might not lead us to eternal life.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.260]   It might still just be religious pride.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.980]   Something about the way he was living was off.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.060]   It's tough to initially put a finger on it, but the rest of the passage goes on to show
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.260]   that he was living off of his works.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:03.480]   He says to the commandments, "I've kept all these."
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.420]   There was this overshadowing cloud of sin and ugliness and selfishness that not only
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:14.380]   threatened his standing as a person trying to follow God, but his response shows that
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.820]   it completely made all the good he was trying to do obsolete.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.860]   And there's our danger.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.060]   We might be doing so much.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:32.660]   We might be thinking we're glorifying God, but that doesn't mean God will accept that.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   God doesn't overlook the sinful parts and accept the service part.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.380]   He doesn't just divide us up and say, "Oh, well, that's okay.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.380]   Oh, thank you so much for this."
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.940]   If the heart isn't in the right place, God is not pleased by our service.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:15:00.660]   We can actually today do service, live for God in the midst of sinful living.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:06.860]   If you're to think about a marriage, if a husband was cheating on a wife, he was committing
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:13.180]   adultery, and yet this husband is kind of a nice man.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.180]   He's a good guy.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.100]   And so he goes home.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.100]   He regularly buys his wife flowers and chocolates, cooks her her favorite meals, takes out the
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:27.180]   trash, does the dishes, does everything like that, takes her on heartfelt dates, goes into
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.220]   deep conversations, "How was your day?" and really starts talking through like, "Oh, man,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.380]   I really want to listen to you."
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:40.420]   Well, in light of the cheating, it won't matter.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.620]   All of these actions that he's doing, it's all tainted.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.220]   It's all marred.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.380]   Actually, those acts of service, if you think about it, takes on kind of a disgusting tinge,
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.220]   right, in light of that.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.660]   So it can be with God and man.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.100]   We think that we can keep sinning and keep living in darkness and still serve God and
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.380]   think that He's happy by it.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.380]   We think that with what we're able to, we will give to God.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.580]   And with our surplus, we will serve Him, but not wholeheartedly, not with everything that
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.060]   we have.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.060]   So with that, we place conditions on our following of Jesus.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.360]   And there are places we say, "Don't touch this part of my life.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.460]   This part is reserved for me.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.700]   I've given you 95%, but this five, I need it."
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:33.700]   We place those conditions on it.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.660]   And it seems like such a small part of our heart.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.900]   Largely, we are serving God.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:45.580]   Largely, we are living in accordance to what we believe.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:53.700]   But if we become people who divide up our heart and say, like, with the way we live,
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.280]   have it all, but not this, that is not what a Christian does or says.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.620]   And in that, it's possible that all our service gets tainted.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.660]   Why?
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.780]   Because we're not actually wholeheartedly serving God.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.220]   We've relegated Him to portions in our lives.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.100]   And that in and of itself begins the great danger of Christianity that's half-hearted.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.400]   This is what you would call a deluded person.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.820]   God has become an accessory in our lives.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.780]   He is something that we just kind of staple onto the end of it, instead of becoming the
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.340]   core of who we are.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.100]   Because as soon as He starts to infringe on the things that really matter, we back up
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:43.540]   and we say no.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.460]   We could have a true desire for God.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:54.260]   We could have a true desire for the things of God, for church things, for service things.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.500]   But even true desire can be devoid of submission to Christ.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.980]   Paul says, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.860]   There is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.300]   It's not me anymore.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.100]   I'm dead in this.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.380]   And I am found only in the person of Jesus.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.420]   That's a Christian.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.060]   Now if we have a knee-jerk reaction of rebellion to that understanding of what it is to be
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.380]   a Christian, that I have been crucified with Christ, that I no longer live.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380]   That's what a Christian says.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.140]   I no longer live.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:38.060]   But has that been our weeks this last week?
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.020]   We have this.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.660]   Rebellion against this.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:49.140]   We say, "I can't even keep a little bit of my time.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.820]   I can't keep a little bit of my resources, a little bit of my life for myself."
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.620]   Because the call to Christian living in Scripture seems to scream against that concept.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.980]   All of it is His.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:08.140]   Top to bottom, everything is His.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.640]   We can talk about enjoying vacations and food and entertainment and partaking in simple
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.580]   pleasures of life.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.820]   We can talk about that.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.380]   But the problem with that is that is not the starting point.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.660]   The starting point is what as a Christian?
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.860]   We've given all that up.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.340]   That's the beginning point.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.540]   We don't need those things.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.980]   That's the beginning point.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.660]   I have been crucified with Christ and these things are rubbish to me.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.100]   That's the starting point.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:44.780]   But day to day, knee-jerk reaction, rebellion.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.940]   And until we get that straight in our lives, we cannot move on to how we might enjoy those
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.900]   things properly.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.980]   God is not honored in a life when hearts are divided.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.660]   He wants our whole heart.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   He wants a heart that cannot be categorized, structured, and divided.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.660]   It can only be given entirely.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.940]   That's it.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.500]   Salvation requires everything.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.700]   Nothing can be kept back from Him.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.420]   There is nothing off limits.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.780]   And as soon as we cut it up and say, "I'm serving here and here and here and here,"
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.700]   even if that's a majority of our time, that is not what a true Christian looks like.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:31.660]   There are lots of examples of scripture about God not wanting just sacrifices, just service.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.320]   In Psalms 51, verse 16, it says, "For you do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.260]   give it."
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.260]   How easy would it be?
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.980]   You know, if it was just give sacrifices, it would be so easy to follow God, right?
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.460]   He says, "Otherwise I would give it.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.400]   You are not pleased with burnt offering.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.020]   The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.020]   will not despise."
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.700]   It says in Hosea 6, "For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, and in the knowledge
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.620]   of God rather than burnt offerings."
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:06.460]   And then Romans 14, 23, it says, "Whatever is not from faith is sin."
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:12.940]   And so in this story, if you look down at verse 17 again, there's one word in verse
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:19.380]   17 that sends off alarms in our head, and that word is good.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.500]   Good.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.140]   How does he use it?
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.660]   He uses it as good teacher.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.740]   And this is big talk.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.380]   This wasn't a word very easily ascribed to people.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.220]   This was a word usually reserved and ascribed to God.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.200]   That explains why Jesus responds in the way he does in verse 18, if you look there.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.940]   He says, "Why do you call me good?
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.060]   No one is good except God alone."
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.300]   This rich young ruler was flippantly using this word.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.420]   Jesus isn't denying what he's saying, okay?
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.300]   He isn't saying like, "No, no, no, I'm not good.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   I actually have sin in me."
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.840]   That would be heretical, right?
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.860]   He is saying, "Your understanding of good is all wrong."
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.660]   This man isn't coming to Jesus thinking that Jesus is God.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.260]   He's coming to Jesus as a teacher.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.940]   He's saying, "Good teacher."
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:16.460]   How can you say to a man in that context, "Good teacher," only if your understanding
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.000]   of that is off?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.740]   In Romans 3, verse 10 through 12, it says, "There is none righteous, not even one.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.500]   There is none who understands.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.660]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.100]   All have turned aside.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.460]   Together they have become useless.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.820]   There is none who does good.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.500]   There is not even one."
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.540]   Now this is a New Testament passage and you're thinking this comes later after the rich young
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.540]   ruler.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   You're thinking this comes from Psalm chapter 14, where it says, "The fool has said in his
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   heart, 'There is no God.'
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.540]   They are corrupt.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.340]   They have committed abominable deeds.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.580]   There is no one who does good.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.380]   The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there are any who
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.140]   understand who seek after God.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.940]   They have all turned aside.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.300]   Together they have become corrupt.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.500]   There is no one who does good, not even one."
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.780]   How could this man come up to Jesus and say, "Good teacher," only if his understanding
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.780]   of good is off?
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.300]   In Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9, it says, "The heart is deceitful more than all else."
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   This is talking about every human heart.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.540]   And is desperately sick.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.420]   Who can understand it?
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.340]   And Isaiah 64, 6, talking about the works that we might present.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.060]   "For all of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous deeds are like
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.060]   a filthy garment.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.480]   And all of us wither like a leaf and our iniquities like the wind take us away.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.860]   Even our best filthy rags before God."
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.260]   There is no one who can do good.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.340]   There is no such thing as that.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.340]   I have a daughter, she's three and a half years old.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.620]   Her name is Addy.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.980]   When she obeys, sometimes I am tempted to say something and it slips out.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.140]   Sometimes I say, "Oh, you've been so good."
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.420]   It's temptation.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   Or when I'm leaving for work in the morning, what might I say?
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.900]   "Be good today, Addy.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:04.940]   Listen to mommy."
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.940]   Or at the end of the day, can have a conversation.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.100]   Because you can be like, "Man, Addy was so good today."
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:19.260]   "Yesterday, she was a bad girl."
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.860]   What do we know?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.780]   Let's take this three and a half year old girl.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.780]   Sinner.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.780]   Right?
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.380]   Dead in her trespasses.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.260]   Enemies of God.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   Hater of God.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.180]   Insolent.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.980]   We know that.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.100]   Be good, Addy.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.340]   If you're a parent and you say that, I have to remind myself, "That is a cruel thing to
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.620]   ask a little kid to do."
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.620]   Be good.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.100]   It's not possible.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:55.780]   But might it not show our misunderstanding of what good actually is?
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.860]   Even doing good gets all mixed up with being a good person.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.540]   But they're completely different things.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.100]   And so I'm just as guilty as having this flippant attitude of good.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.100]   And we know this.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.100]   We know that there's no good.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.620]   But I think so did this ruler.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.620]   He knew it too.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.780]   But he still felt an improper understanding of it.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.220]   And it was affecting the most important question in the world to him, and that is how to receive
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   salvation.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.980]   And this is something we can easily fall into.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.220]   We can know that we're not good.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.420]   It's easy.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.440]   It's really easy to know that we're not good, right?
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.180]   We can know that we're desperately in need of God's grace and his mercy in our lives
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.040]   to save us.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.400]   But for real, we don't believe it.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.740]   We think we're actually not too bad.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.320]   And in that, work salvation doesn't just creep in.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.220]   It becomes the false foundation upon which we build our faith.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:02.020]   We think I can actually be good by my works, apart from God.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.660]   And we come back to this divided life, this divided heart again, because we have to be
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.420]   able to separate our hearts if we think that we can do it.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.420]   Why?
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.380]   Because we think in certain portions we can serve God.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.540]   And we can actually look good in it.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.460]   We all kind of get ready to come to church, right?
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:26.420]   At least we wash our faces and brush our teeth and put on clothes that maybe you wouldn't
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.260]   wear around the house or whatever.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.260]   We do that.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.260]   And we come here.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.260]   And then we might serve.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.460]   I took a walk around this morning, and it was nice.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.460]   It was really pleasant.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.300]   I'm just walking around.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.700]   And then I see someone at the cafes.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.900]   They're like, "Oh, do you want anything from cafe?"
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.900]   It's like, "Well, thank you.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.660]   No, it's okay."
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.180]   And then I come down, and then two people are handing me bulletins like, "Good morning!"
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.660]   I was like, "Oh, this is nice."
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.060]   I've got a praise team.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.700]   They sound great.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.100]   Look at everything that's going.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:02.180]   Everyone looks nice and put together.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.140]   And so we divide it up, and we say, like, in certain places, this is our service of
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.140]   God.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.540]   And even if that's a majority of our lives, if there are portions in our heart that we've
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:18.820]   divided and said, "No," we begin to dissect and categorize things in our lives.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.860]   So things begin to happen.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.100]   We have a place for the big sins.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.680]   We have a place for the things that we really struggle with.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.740]   And they're designated as the sinful things.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.240]   But we come to church, and we still look like a shining example of a Christian.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.120]   We go through the motions.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.120]   We sing the right things.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.180]   We use our talents in the right ways.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.460]   It's just those other places in our lives that are filled with sin.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.940]   And so as we divide up our heart, we struggle with laziness, but we don't really feel bad
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.060]   about it, honestly.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:01.260]   We struggle with arrogance and ego, but it doesn't break our hearts.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.300]   We're greedy.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.580]   But it's not a big deal to us.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:16.900]   So it becomes something accepted in our lives because we've gotten so good at this understanding
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   of thinking, "There's a way for me to be good."
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:32.740]   But should we not, if this is all sin, despise all of it?
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:39.940]   How could sin possibly become acceptable to us in our lives?
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:47.980]   Should not every sinful thought and intention and encounter in our hearts cause us to desperately,
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:56.900]   not just, "God, I need you," but in desperation and urgency, when we sense sin, that the Holy
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:09.620]   Spirit would cause our hearts to see need for God.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:16.500]   But we don't function in that way because we think we're pretty good.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.060]   And so we're good people who kind of sort of struggle with sin.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.220]   And we relegate our sin struggles with one of the pet sins we have in our lives, and
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:27.700]   we look at that one sin and we say, "If I just kick that sin, man, I'm flying high.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.980]   If I just get that one, I know I'm going to look like what I want to look like as a Christian."
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:38.420]   And our standard is not God who says, "Be perfect as I am perfect.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.540]   Be holy as I am holy."
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.700]   Our standard becomes this world.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.060]   And further broken down, our standard is each other.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.700]   Like for those of us who have been at church for a longer time, we think we know more,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.380]   we've experienced more.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:30:01.260]   And so we actually feel pretty good as people, generally.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.260]   We may say with our words what we know, "I'm not good.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.260]   I'm sinful.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.260]   I need God."
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.740]   But the whisper, whisper part of our hearts, it says, "But I'm not really that, but I'm
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   actually pretty good."
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.980]   And so how do we do it?
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.260]   How do we demarcate it?
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.220]   We kind of compare with standards.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.900]   We say, "Oh, Pastor Peter, I'm like there.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.300]   I'm not there."
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.700]   And we look at like this home group leader, "I'm not there."
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.900]   This I don't know who else there might be.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:34.060]   There are lots of people that we might look up to, a small group leader, like an elder,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.980]   Philip.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:41.780]   And just like this rich young ruler came before Jesus, that's how we start to kind of think
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:47.660]   through good, evil, sin, how I'm doing.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.340]   And so this man, this rich young ruler has come before Jesus with that kind of attitude.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.540]   That's why he calls Jesus good.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.260]   Because he thinks Jesus is gooder than him.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:01.660]   See how deluded this could become?
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.420]   Wasn't it the Apostle Paul himself toward the latter years of his life who said, "I
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.140]   am the chief of sinners"?
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.500]   Not that this became his sole focus, but that it became a fodder to an increasing need and
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.380]   urgency for the gospel in his own life till the day he dies.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:25.300]   Our sin should cause us to understand that there is nothing good in me.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.660]   That Christ alone is my only good.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.900]   That everything else drives me to him.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.020]   And we come and we try to manipulate our hearts on Sunday mornings to feel some kind of guilt
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.100]   for the sin we know we've been committing.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.300]   Or we look at it improperly and just are weighed down with guilt and try to figure out, "What
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.180]   can I do to get rid of this thing?"
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.540]   This man comes to Jesus and throws around that word "good teacher" and Jesus says, "You
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.900]   don't know what it is to be good."
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.620]   And this is the very place where you subtly and quietly declare that God isn't really
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.700]   needed in your life.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.260]   This is the epitome of work salvation.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.340]   A religion that works for it rather than depending on the heart of the gospel message, which
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.860]   is grace, mercy, compassion.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.980]   It's a gift.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.380]   You cannot earn it.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:20.660]   It must be given to you.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.220]   And for us today, then we might need to ask the question, "Am I really saved?
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.460]   Have I thrust myself onto the grace and mercy of God?"
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.540]   And for those of us who are already believers, we might need to ask, "Is the same gospel
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.900]   that we were justified into the same gospel that continues to save us in sanctification
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.220]   today?"
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.920]   This rich young ruler thought he knew what it meant to be good and that it pretty much
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.340]   applied to him.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.140]   Did he really need Jesus?
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.700]   I think he just needed advice on how to become a better person.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.700]   God was never the goal.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.660]   God was always a byproduct for him.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.740]   And so in verse 19, if you look there, Jesus brings out these six commandments.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   He says, "You know the commandments.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.740]   Do not murder.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   Do not commit adultery.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   Do not steal.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   Do not bear false witness.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.740]   Do not defraud.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   Honor your father and mother."
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.380]   Now, the Ten Commandments up for you here.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.460]   And so how that works is he goes into number six, seven, eight, nine, and then he says
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.260]   ten in an application-based way.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:19.340]   Don't defraud is probably to a rich young man like this guy, coveting was probably like,
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.940]   he probably wouldn't have gotten hit by that.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   So it's don't defraud.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.900]   It's an application of what coveting might do.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:30.100]   And then it goes back to commandment number five.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.340]   Those are the six commandments given.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.300]   Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, five.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:42.060]   And when Jesus says this, this man responds by saying, "I've kept them all."
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.740]   And we know this is ridiculous.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.420]   Look at Matthew chapter five.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.500]   It says, "You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not commit murder, and
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.860]   whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.'
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.340]   But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.340]   court."
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.540]   In verse 27, it says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.820]   But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.500]   adultery with her in his heart."
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.220]   See, being religious is a danger to true Christianity.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.540]   This was the problem for the Pharisees.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.320]   They thought they could follow a set of rules, that this was religion.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.580]   And we might look at this and say, "I know this.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:22.580]   That is not me.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.580]   I stay clear to that.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.620]   I don't live legalistically."
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:30.360]   But this is closer than we might think.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.540]   How often do we, when asked by someone how we're doing spiritually, think about how well
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.060]   we've been keeping God's commands?
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.300]   Like, "Have I been lying?
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.980]   Well, no, I haven't been lying.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:44.420]   I haven't been, you know, I haven't been like cheating or, uh, I, I, you know."
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.420]   We kind of think this way, right?
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   How many of us do that?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.180]   How many of us, when we're asked how we're doing spiritually, think about, "Well, how
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.740]   have I been keeping up in the disciplines?"
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.180]   Our starting point just goes right to the actions.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.980]   What have I been doing?
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.420]   And this is the problem for us today.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.820]   You might say this is a story about people who call themselves Christians but don't really
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.220]   follow after Christ.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.220]   But what about us?
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.420]   As true Christ followers, what it shows is that this is, this is the inclination of a
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   sinful heart.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:24.340]   Do we call ourselves Christians but in our own way don't really follow after Jesus?
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:32.660]   Have we been blindfolded by heartfelt, desired religiosity?
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:39.580]   Because just because we genuinely desire something, just because we're heartfelt in our service,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:44.740]   and we kind of want the things of God, and we don't want to do the things that God is,
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.800]   like when we think about, like, let's say you lied this week, right?
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.940]   We think about lying like, "Oh, I really don't want to lie."
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.180]   You could be heartfelt in that, even be guilty in that, think like, "I don't want to be like
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:36:00.860]   that anymore," and be devoid of God.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.100]   If we were to set on a gradient scale how a nominal Christian lived versus how a true
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:12.740]   believer is to live, maybe here at Berean we look a little bit more biblical.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:17.380]   But in our hearts, are we actually any different?
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:24.340]   This man was genuine and heartfelt, but he was puffed up in pride, arrogance, and self-centeredness.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:28.380]   What looked like humility was not humility.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.480]   So what about you?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   What about me?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.540]   What about us as a church?
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:42.220]   Might we look like a shadow of the rich young ruler?
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.960]   If we want to answer that question, this is our second and final point for today.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.020]   The command that Jesus gives next to the rich young ruler will help us to identify that.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.020]   Look down at verse 21.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.480]   Jesus responds and says, "Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him,
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.200]   'One thing you lack, go and sell all you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.720]   in heaven and come, follow me.'"
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.360]   It says that Jesus looks past all the superficial stuff.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   It says he looks, he loves, and then he answers.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.320]   This rich young ruler, if he walked through the back of our doors, this would be the guy
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.840]   who were like, "Hey, join a service team immediately.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.400]   Get into our membership.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.440]   We want you to start discipling people really soon."
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.080]   This is the type of person you're tempted to do that with.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:38.680]   But Jesus looks past all of those externals.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:47.000]   Jesus' command to this person when he asked, "What must I do to be saved?"
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.800]   You would expect something different from Jesus, right?
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.360]   You would expect if someone comes up to Jesus and says, "What must I do to be saved?"
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.040]   It would look kind of like Acts 16.30.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.520]   That's where the Philippian jailer comes and says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.840]   They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household."
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.160]   But Jesus doesn't say anything like that.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Why?
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:12.640]   Because this is a man who has grown accustomed to doing and to performing.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:18.200]   So what Jesus does is almost like, man, it's like the word "savage" would kind of get to
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.320]   it, right?
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.520]   You can't just do this.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.680]   Jesus is playing his game and he asks him to do something that is going to prove that
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.600]   he can't do this without what is actually needed.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.440]   And what's needed?
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.320]   It's a complete and utter dependence and desperation and urgency and a love and a need for God.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:49.200]   The rich young ruler, he answers this question and shows everything that's needed to know
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.240]   about his heart.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.160]   Beyond all this man's accolades, beyond all his credentials, beyond how long he's been
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.520]   in the synagogue, beyond his good deeds and his good works and his service, Jesus is seeing
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.400]   right through all the money that he's given to the poor.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.320]   He's looking right through all the words that he's used as a teacher to teach people in
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.920]   the synagogue of the word of God.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.880]   And Jesus just simply says in verse 21, "Go and sell everything that you have and you'll
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.880]   have treasure in heaven."
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:25.480]   Now why does Jesus choose those six commandments?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.780]   That's a question for us.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.000]   And leave out the first four.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.760]   Well, we know that the last six of the Ten Commandments have to do with relationship
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.280]   with people.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.520]   And the first four of the commandments have to do with relationship with us and God.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:43.480]   And then in Matthew 22, verse 37 through 40, we understand that all the commandments have
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   everything to do about loving God and others.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:54.000]   To put it simply, it's about love.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.560]   Here's this man who comes up and says, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.640]   Jesus says, "Do the commandments."
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.080]   And the man sits there and goes, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo," checks them all off.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.200]   See, these aren't just things to do.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.840]   These aren't just things to check off.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.740]   It's not just service.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:18.500]   Those things are all going to be a fruit, a result, an indicator of something that exists
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.960]   beyond what you can actually do.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   Like this is a love for God.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:28.800]   But these Ten Commandments are built to show us something.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.640]   First is to show us that everything is about love.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.080]   That this relationship that God is wanting to have with people isn't so much, "Do what
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   I say."
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.840]   It's about, "I love you.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.840]   Love me."
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:46.680]   And secondly, these commands are meant to show, "Doo, doo, we can't do it.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.680]   I cannot lie.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   I cannot steal.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   I cannot cheat.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.240]   But you tell me to love.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.600]   How can I do that?"
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.680]   You can try to do things to manipulate your heart to love people.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.200]   With me and Keziah, if our anniversary is coming up, I could put it on my calendar a
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.800]   week before and then I could say, "Oh, I better get something ready, like a date night
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.320]   or whatever, whatever."
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.200]   And it's because I love her.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.360]   So I could do those kinds of actions, but devoid of love for Keziah.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.160]   We could try to force ourselves to love people.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.760]   Think about a nagging parent.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.600]   Like a parent is nagging.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.880]   And then, when I was a college student, what I began to do was, "Okay, I have to love
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.820]   my parents, but this is really hard to love my parents sometimes.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.680]   And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to think about all the things that she's
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.900]   done for me that was so nice over the years and how sacrificial she was of me."
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.280]   And I think about it, I'm like, "Oh my gosh, my mom."
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.400]   I'd have to do it that way.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.080]   And so we manipulate ourselves to try to love people, but we cannot in our own souls love
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.240]   people or love God without the transforming love of God coming into our souls and wrecking
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.680]   it and overhauling the soul.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.780]   It's just not possible.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.780]   This rich young ruler thought he was doing the things, but he didn't understand.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.640]   He did not truly love God.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.940]   He did not truly love other people, even.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.640]   This rich young ruler had not and cannot keep these commandments that he thought he had
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.680]   kept.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.920]   He was genuine in desire.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.320]   He was heartfelt, even.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.960]   But it wasn't real.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   This was religion.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.920]   And that's why in verse 22 it says that he "hangs his head and he walks away saddened."
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.240]   That word is actually, it's a cloud that comes above.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.720]   Your whole world just darkens.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.600]   And Jesus says to this rich young ruler, "One thing you lack."
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.280]   To a man who has never lacked anything, he says, "One thing you lack."
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   And it's like, "What?
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   What do I lack?"
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:05.600]   Jesus omitted the first four commandments, right, in his list to show that this man does
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.800]   not actually love God.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.360]   If he did, the answer to what Jesus says next, "Go and sell all that you have," we know what
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   that would have looked like.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.920]   That would have been an instantaneous yes.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.520]   If you love God.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.720]   All Christians make that claim, actually.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.600]   Before becoming true believers and Christ followers, all Christians make this claim.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:39.200]   That we have forsaken the world because we desperately need Jesus.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.520]   That we don't want the things of the world because we love Christ.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:51.360]   That is every Christian's mantra and claim to what we believe.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.600]   The idea is that we aren't to look at what we're sacrificing.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   That's what this man did.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   His whole world darkens because he sees the things that he's being asked to sacrifice.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.480]   Because as soon as we start looking at the things that we're asked to sacrifice, that
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.920]   shows that we love those things.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   We love God.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:20.600]   The idea is that we are to look at the beauty of the one we're following.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.680]   It's that our desire is to drop everything when we see something of such great, infinite
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   value.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:33.520]   And it's our application.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.200]   What does it look like to give up everything then?
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.880]   Because this story can be discouraging to us.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.760]   Because then aren't we supposed to give up everything?
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.320]   Aren't we supposed to sell everything?
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.960]   Keep nothing to ourselves?
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.400]   And that's the question we ask.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   Rather than look at like, "Oh man, Jesus, I would follow him for anything."
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.440]   Rather that being our knee jerk, our knee jerk becomes what?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.340]   "What do I have to give up?"
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.480]   And already it's too late.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.000]   Already that has become an indicator.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.360]   As soon as we ask it.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.640]   This passage doesn't literally mean sell everything.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.720]   This is a call to discipleship, not poverty.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.760]   So then what does it mean?
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:26.040]   It's that at any moment in time when we evaluate our hearts, we would gladly and willingly
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.240]   give up everything we have in our lives.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.120]   All things.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.800]   Nothing reserved, nothing untouched.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.780]   We evaluate our hearts and we dig and we dig and we dig and we look in there and we look
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:44.480]   up at Christ again and we say, "Yes, today I give it all up to follow you because I love
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   you.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.540]   Because you are worth that."
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:54.280]   So much so that it doesn't even feel like a sacrifice.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.760]   That's the Christian.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.760]   That's the call to discipleship.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.440]   All our aspirations, all our hopes, all our dreams, anything that we claim as our own,
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.300]   we would bend our knee and say, "Lord Jesus, take it all.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   You are better.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.880]   You are my life and I will follow you to the cross.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.480]   The Father's kingdom, that's why I want to come.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.320]   I no longer function as a citizen of this world.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.320]   These things you're asking me to let go of, these are things of the world.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.360]   Of course not.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.360]   Of course I don't want this.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   What are you...
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.760]   Yes, I'll give it up for you."
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.240]   And so to that question, again, if we say you're meeting up with someone this week and
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.720]   you ask that question to each other, "Hey, how are you doing spiritually?"
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.040]   I've been very encouraged by the way here at Berean.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.000]   I've been seeing a lot of people meeting up and going deep into these talks.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.240]   A lot of them starting with that very question, "How are you doing spiritually?"
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:53.520]   But to that question, our minds should not drift to how little we're sinning, how well
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.800]   we're keeping our disciplines, that we're gauging in upon these different factors and
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   values.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.920]   Maybe like, "Oh, I'm reading this really interesting book.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.040]   It's a Christian book."
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.960]   It's not about the amount of tangible service you're rendering to the church.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.960]   We might think about these things.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   "How are you doing spiritually?"
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   "I'm pretty good."
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.620]   See, the thing about this is that rich young ruler could be given this list and he could
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:29.500]   check them off and say, "I'm doing pretty good," and that's what happened.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.400]   But to be doing well spiritually, all you need to ask is, "Do you love God with all
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.280]   your heart, soul, mind, and strength?"
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.340]   That's it.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.520]   So much so that everything becomes shadows and byproducts and things that don't matter
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.400]   as much and things that are meant as a means to love my God more.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.440]   Let's look at the disciplines.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.080]   There's so much more than a religious activity.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.460]   We know this.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.480]   The question of these disciplines is, "Do we do it out of our love for God and as a
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:09.960]   result of every discipline, do we love God more?"
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:17.200]   Every discipline, every single time we do it, is deemed successful only if it causes
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.720]   us to love God more.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.400]   That's all.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.160]   If it doesn't, you might be puffing up your head.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.240]   I might be deluding myself into thinking things.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.280]   What about evangelizing?
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.640]   What drives us in evangelizing?
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   Is it a love for God?
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.920]   I think a lot of times it might be fear.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.800]   I don't want this person to experience the eternal wrath and judgment of God.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.120]   So we think about our mom and go, "Oh my goodness.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.720]   Mom, let me tell you about Jesus."
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.560]   That's helpful and good and necessary.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.920]   But shouldn't we be driven more out of a love for God?
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   You know when you love something or someone, you just kind of talk about that?
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.440]   It's not so much a theological exercise or trying to convince people.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.960]   We throw around terms of imputations and first Adams and all this different stuff.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.640]   We're just kind of saying these things.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   Or we might be big on apologetics, which is again, helpful, good, and necessary.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.800]   But we have these evolutionary things down.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.280]   Or it might be philosophical, like the moral argument.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.960]   We have all these things and we're evangelizing.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   We're ready.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   Okay, let's talk.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:31.520]   And then all these things become words that come out of us, nothing showing that we love
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.120]   God.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.520]   But shouldn't that be the thing that drives everything?
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.600]   That out of a love for God, "Let me tell you about this God that I love and I know.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Let me tell you.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.880]   He saved my life.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.560]   He sacrificed his son for me."
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:54.120]   Yeah, these questions are important to answer and they're going to be answered.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:59.600]   But you need to know who He is because I want you to know what I know, who I know, what
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.200]   I know is going to come.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:10.680]   This is so important to me, so valuable to me, that God is worth that much to me.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:16.320]   We can give money, a lot of it, to the point it hurts.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:23.400]   To the India pastors, to missions, literally to the point where we have nothing left for
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   ourselves.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.240]   We can give, but it could be devoid of a love for God.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.520]   It could still be considered good works.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.720]   Remember some of the passages in Scripture that talk about these people who are doing
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.800]   things but the result is completely opposite.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.480]   In Matthew 7.21 it says, "Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   in your name?
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.200]   And in your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles.'"
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.760]   This is a person who's done so much for the kingdom of God supposedly and then it says
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.920]   Jesus looks at them, "I never knew you.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.520]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.640]   You have not been keeping the law."
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.680]   First Corinthians 13.1, "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels," look at what
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.800]   I could do, I do all these things, "but do not have love, I become a noisy gong or a
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   clinging cymbal.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.120]   If I have the gift of prophecy, I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.220]   all faith so as to remove mountains, but I do not have love, I am nothing.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.440]   And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor and if I surrender my body to be burned,
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.480]   but do not have love, it's nothing."
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.640]   Nothing.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.360]   Our service to God is nothing.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:38.160]   So the big question is, do you, do I, do we as a church, do we love God with all our heart,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.840]   soul, mind, and strength?
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.300]   The story is so challenging to us because as believers we need to be reminded that we
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:51.920]   are prone to this, that even genuine heartfelt desire can be sinful.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:59.620]   We could want the things of God, but actually not want God.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.200]   And at every point in life we need to reevaluate this.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.000]   Have I truly given up everything?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.720]   Because that question is going to help us answer, do I love him?
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.600]   And we need to identify those things in our lives that we are unwilling to give up.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.240]   And then we need to give it up.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.080]   It's not very hard.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.680]   Find the thing that we're unwilling to give up and then figure out the way to give that
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:30.300]   up because I love God.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:38.320]   We cannot be looking at the time once upon a go, you know, that I gave up everything
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.880]   to follow Christ and say like, "See, I'm saved.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.280]   Oh, I remember those days when I was passionate and I gave up everything.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.640]   Dealing with apathy today, but I remember then I actually gave up everything."
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.760]   That means nothing for today.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.720]   Today is when we need to give up everything.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.120]   The Christian call to discipleship, what Jesus is saying, this is not a starting point, this
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.840]   is life.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.600]   God becomes everything to you forever.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.800]   In heaven, God is going to be everything to us forever.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   After 10,000 years you're like, "Whoa, I've just lived 10,000 years."
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:19.600]   You're going to be still God.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.720]   So I hope that this story of the rich young ruler will be reminding us today.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.120]   And I'll kind of close this off on these words that Jesus gave to this man, "Go sell all
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.280]   that you have and come follow me."
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:43.480]   Would you take a moment to pray with me?
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:05.280]   Oh God, you are, you really are a great, awesome, worthy, beautiful, sovereign, powerful, magnificent
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.520]   God.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.800]   You are the creator.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.920]   You are everything.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.360]   There is no one, there is nothing like you.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.720]   Father, you are life itself.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:29.280]   God, there is nothing I would trade in for my relationship with you.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.820]   And so God, would you help us then to turn around, look at our lives and see if how we're
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.320]   living fits with what we believe.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.800]   God, you are all we want.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:47.360]   And so today, would you help us to remember that and remember the original call.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:54.680]   And remember God, that today is the day you want us then to let go of these things, to
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:55:00.920]   put aside the sins and the weight that so easily entangles us, to draw our eyes on our
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.800]   Christ all the way to the cross where he was crucified, that we might be crucified with
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.720]   him, that we might attain to the resurrection that he might give to us so that one day we
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:17.400]   can attain not the inheritances that we're given here on this world, but God, the inheritance
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:23.120]   of heaven, the heavenly things that he promises.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:29.240]   And God, even devoid of those things, even if we had nothing else, God, if you are there,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.320]   Lord that's all we want.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.760]   So God, teach us that, let us be a church who doesn't just do nice things and good things
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   and think we're okay, but Father, that we understand that we are in sin, that we are
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.640]   in need of you and that we love God more than anything else.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
