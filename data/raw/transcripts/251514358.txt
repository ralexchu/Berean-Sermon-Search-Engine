[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   >> Yes, I am eager, but I cannot.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   But we are so grateful.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Even my wife and I, we feel the warmth of Korean, and already, maybe it's supernatural.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I feel a love deepening.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And it was just last week when we left our old church, Good Stewards Church, and I was there for 20 years.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   So it was a long time.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   There was a lot of tears.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And this morning, you know, as I was singing alongside you guys, and, you know, even thinking and praying through this morning,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   we are so, so grateful that Berean is our new church family.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And we want to really be that.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We want to be running this race with you.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We want to live life with you.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We would want to challenge you as much as you challenge us.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And, yeah, and I'm very, very grateful to Pastor Mark and Pastor Peter who have done nothing but encourage us.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Because, honestly, I'm very nervous.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'm really nervous to be up here.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I am super introverted.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   But we're so grateful to the pastoral staff here.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You guys have an amazing -- well, we.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   We have an amazing pastoral staff here at Berean.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   So let's go directly into the Word.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And hopefully, please, I hope to get to know you guys more as the years go.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So if you could turn with me to Ephesians 2, verse 11.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And we're going to be reading through verse 18.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But we'll touch on verse 19 through 22 as well towards the end.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Ephesians 2, 11.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   [Reading]
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   [Reading]
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   [Reading]
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Can we pray together?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   God, thank you.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Thank you for Berean.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Thank you for all of these hearts that are here.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   God, even to entrust someone they don't know that well to come up on a pulpit
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and unravel the Word of God.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And, God, I'm humbled.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And so, God, I pray that it really would not be man, but it would be you, our God,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   speaking through your Word, convicting through your Spirit.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And so, Father, it would not be just gauging a stranger up on a pulpit,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   but, Father, truly engaging your Word and your Scripture as precious to us,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that it might affect and transform the way we live, the way we think,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   even how we breathe and our hearts beat.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Father, all of that would fall in line with who you are and how much we love you
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   because of what you've done for us.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Help me now as I preach this Word to be clear.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Amen.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   We're going to be talking a little bit about disunity today.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And we can see disunity everywhere.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Politics.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You know, I try to keep up with the news a little bit, and politics, oh, man,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   it does nothing but bring disunity, doesn't it?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Even when we were looking at the presidential election in the fall,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   we saw how it fractured, not just the disunity between someone like Hillary
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Clinton and Donald Trump, but a fracturing of America happened,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and we saw that, and it continues.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   We saw a great divide within an entire nation and with people.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   This is disunity, and we know that there's disunity everywhere.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You see it amongst nations.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Even today there's technically still a war going on in North Korea and South
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Korea.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Since 1953 when the war ended, only seven times have there been an
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   opportunity for family members from North and South to be able to see each
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   other, and you can see the tangible effects of disunity and what might
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   happen.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And there are other wars going on today.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   There's the war in Afghanistan.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   There's a civil war in Iraq.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   There's the Boko Haram insurgency, a Syrian civil war.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   There's the Kurdish-Turkish conflict.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   There's the Libyan crisis, and there's a lot of stuff going on, and we can
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   see that there is disunity, conflict everywhere.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You see it amongst people and governments.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You see it on college campuses.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Recently there was the whole Black Lives Matter movement that brought
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   about division, institutionalized law enforcement and a black community, a
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   conflict that has drawn in all races.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There's disunity everywhere.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We hear of mass shootings, stabbings, explosions, even right here in
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   America.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   There's disunity in our schools.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   We see fights break out.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We see people clawing through each other to get to the top.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   We see people gossiping and slandering and hating and killing in that way.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   We see it in our workplaces, between employer and employee, between
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   employees and employees.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We see disunity everywhere, even in our families.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Doors slammed and faces yelling and crying, misunderstandings, silent
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   treatments, divorces, tense holiday gatherings.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   This is actually why this has been on my mind, because the holidays just
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   passed, but there's nothing like a holiday to show the disunity between a
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   family, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   People playing favorites, saying mean things to one another, things that
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   are hurtful.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   A disunity that might also fly under the radar.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   They're not always apparent, but it's always present.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You go into any room with any group of people, and you're going to see
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   immediate disunity, division, scoping eyes, observation, constantly looking
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and bringing about division.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And so it is that you'll also find disunity within the church.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Now, there's something about disunity that feels wrong, and there's
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   something about unity that just feels right.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So where did all this disunity come from?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Why do we partake in this kind of thing?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Well, it came from the very beginning when sin entered into the world, when
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Adam and Eve made the decision to eat of the fruit of the knowledge -- tree
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And immediately, as soon as they did that, there came a division between
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   God and humanity.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And because of that, there became a division between man and woman, or
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Adam and Eve.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And that division, it wasn't just a slow, you know, gradual division type
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   of thing.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It ramped up really fast, to the point where by the first set of kids,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   they're killing each other in Cain and Abel.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   This conflict, then, isn't rooted in disagreement.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   This unity isn't rooted in differing ideas.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   This unity is actually rooted in this idea of sin.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The problem always has been and always will be sin.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   That is what's going to bring about conflict.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Two people, two sides proclaiming that they are right in a given situation,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   essentially proclaiming that my glory is of the utmost importance in this
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   situation when I'm arguing with you, fighting, clawing, killing to get it,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   building, towering relational walls between one another.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now, unity is what we're meant for.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It feels right.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   This unity feels wrong because it is not how God made things to be.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Now, in this passage we read from in chapter 2, verse 11 through 18,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   we see that the division, that this division and conflict and fighting that
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   we're talking about must not be found in the household of God.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It must not be found in the church.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And it must not be found not just in the church, but in the believer.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Christians are to look radically different.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   A Christian dealing with disunity should show a depth of theology and
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   doctrine that changes the way we live and preaches the gospel by how we
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   respond to division and clashing and disunity.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Christians are stable and rock steady in a world filled with strife.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And the answer all goes back to our understanding of the Bible,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   our understanding of the gospel.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And that's what we see in Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11 through 22,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   which actually kind of mimics Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1 through 10.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Now, a lot of us know Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1 through 10,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and we understand, you know, for by grace we have been saved through faith,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   where we're coming from.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   This passage in verse 11 through 18, it has a little bit of that.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Like, remember who you once were and remember the grace of God in your life.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So we're going to be going through just a few main points.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The first is this.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   The first point is that we were far from God.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   If you could look down with me at verse 11, Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   it says, "Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   which is made in the flesh by hands, remember that you were at that time
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   in the world."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Now, he singles out a group of people here called the Gentiles,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and this is Paul writing this letter.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And because this is in Ephesus, which is a port city,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   there are a lot of different cultures that kind of mingle
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and migrate into this area.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And so you're going to find a lot of Gentiles.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And with the Greek influence here, there is a God that's being worshipped here
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   called Artemis.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And in this city, there is a great fascination with magic and the occult.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   This was a city that is far from God.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   This is a city full of as pagan as you could get.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   But because of the diaspora of the Jews, there were both Jews and Gentiles
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   in the church.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   But even though both the Jew and the Gentile might be a believer in the church,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   there was perpetual infighting within the church in matters of superiority
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and hierarchy still being a very relevant issue to them.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   These Gentiles, which Paul is directly addressing them,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   he reminds them of something.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   He reminds specifically this group, the Gentiles, that you were in the flesh.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And he says, "Remember," and he doesn't say it just once.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He says it twice.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   "Don't forget.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Don't forget where you used to be.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Don't forget who you used to be.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Don't forget the darkness you lived in and how scary and terrifying of a place that was.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Don't forget the fact that you were destined for hell.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Don't forget how you were so hopeless in your life.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Don't forget where you came from."
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He's saying, "Don't forget that you have a new hope."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And at this point, all the Jews are kind of nodding their heads
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   because Paul is addressing who?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   The Gentiles.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Paul is addressing the Gentiles and saying,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   "Remember all of these different things that you are not."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   We're going to go through those in just a moment.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "Remember this list of things that shows how far you were from God."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And here's the Jew believer looking at this and saying,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   "Yeah, you remember, Gentiles."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It's inherent in these Jews, built into them to feel the division
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   between them and their Gentile brothers and sisters.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And for the Gentiles, this is a stinging reminder that they are not the original,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   historical people of God.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So Jews are saying, "Yeah, don't forget that."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Because in their understanding, though they knew there were sinners,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   these Jewish believers,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   just as though they knew that they needed the grace of God, just like the Gentiles,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   they still had built into them, but we're a little bit better than them.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   We're a little bit more blessed than these Gentiles.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   We're a little bit of more worth than these Gentiles.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We were closer to God than these guys.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And that's human.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We like to look at someone and say, "I'm not as bad as that guy.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I still have something a little bit better to offer than that person."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And in this statement, as Paul is addressing the Gentiles,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   he calls out this term.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   This term is "uncircumcision."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And we're not going to do a deep study on this one,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   but there's a reason why this term is being used.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Gentiles being called to uncircumcision was actually a Jewish ethnic slur
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   given to the Gentile.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   This is something a Jew would say with a sneer on their face, saying,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   "Ah, you uncircumcised people."
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   If you know the story of David and Goliath,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   when he wants to insult Goliath to his face, he doesn't go up--
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   this is 700 years back--he doesn't just go up to Goliath and go like,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   "You Philistine dog," or anything like that.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You know what he calls him?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   He calls him, "You uncircumcised Philistine."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This was an insult.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   This is a term that has hundreds of years of conflict
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and divide behind it between Jew and Gentile.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Circumcision was the precious covenant God gave to Abraham in Genesis 17.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   To stamp his mark on his people Israel, he would stamp them with this.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   This is what separated Israel from every other nation
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   and what made them so specially blessed.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And this idea of being part of the circumcision versus the uncircumcision
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   was still a disunifying issue in the Ephesian church.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So as much as you might find disunity in society and in the world,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   the church was not above the temptation of disunity.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   To allow external factors to dictate the movement of the church,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   here's how a Jew might view the Gentile.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   This is from William Barclay.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He says, "The Jew had an immense contempt for the Gentile.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   The Gentiles," said the Jews, "were created by God to be fuel for the fires of hell.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   God," they said, "loves only Israel of all the nations that he had made.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   It was not even lawful to render help to a Gentile mother in her hour of sorest need,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   for that would simply be to bring another Gentile into the world.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Until Christ came, the Gentiles were an object of contempt to the Jews.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   The barrier between them was absolute.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It was a Jewish boy married a Gentile girl, or if a Jewish girl married a Gentile boy,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   the funeral of that Jewish boy or girl was carried out.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Such contact with the Gentile was the equivalent of death."
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Christian or not, this is the type of sentiment between the Jew and the Gentile.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And they carried this into the church.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And Paul begins to list out, "Remember who you were."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And we're going to go through a quick five things,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   if you look down at the passage that we just read in verse 11 and 12.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And the first is this, "Separated from Christ."
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Separated from Christ isn't just a little separation.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   This word just means completely apart.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You were completely apart from Christ.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   There was no relational hope of salvation from a Messiah.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   There was a deep void between the Gentile and God.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   The second thing he says is that they were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And that's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   You were aliens.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   You were different.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Completely different.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Commonwealth literally means citizenship.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You were of a different nation.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   You were not of us.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You were of something else.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   You were not of the kingdom of God.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   You were of the kingdom of the world.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And there's a big divide here that he's trying to show.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   If you watch the Olympics, the Winter Olympics are coming out,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and you're not going to see like a German Olympic athlete
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   all of a sudden decide they're going to play for like America.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   There's loyalty there, and there's divisions, and it's done in the sense of harmony,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   but there are divisions, different nations.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   He's saying you are alienated from the commonwealth, from the citizenship of Israel.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Thirdly, he says you are strangers to the covenants of promise.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Foreign.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   You are not having the promises of Israel.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Covenants were the way that God made the promises to Israel.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   So basically, if he did not make a covenant with Israel,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   there would be none of his promises for Israel.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   He gave covenants to people like Abraham, Jacob, and David,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   and covenants are the way that God made the promises of the future Messiah that's coming to save Israel.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Paul was saying, "Remember, Gentiles, you were strangers to the covenant of promise.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   You didn't even have the hope of the Messiah."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Fourthly, he says, "No hope. You had no hope in your life."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Some of you guys might relate very recently too,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   but for me, I became a believer, I mean it was years ago, but I remember it so vividly,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   what it was like to live without hope.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   As a proclaiming atheist, I remember thinking about my life and thinking,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   "Okay, well, if this is true, if I cease to exist, then what about tomorrow?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   How am I supposed to live?"
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   As I would think through this concept of what it would look like,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   the hopelessness and darkness and despair that that brings,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   that was for the Gentile.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   They had no hope.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   These Gentiles were most likely pagan before,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and so they believed one of two things, either that they would cease to exist,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   or that their souls would wander for eternity.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Can you imagine that, just believing that and trying to go to sleep at night,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and waking up the next day and trying to live your life?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   There's just no hope. Paul is reminding them, "You had no hope."
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Fifthly, if it's going to get any worse, he says, "You are without God in the world."
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Now, this is heavier than it seems.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   This was a polytheistic culture, and they worshipped thousands, myriads of different gods.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   To say that they would give their lives to God and sacrifice to these gods and all this kind of thing,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and for Paul to say, "You worship all these things, this is so sad,"
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and yet you are without God in the world.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's a sad picture.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Paul says, "Gentiles, remember that this is who you were.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You were far from God.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   You were light years from God, an astronomical divide from God.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You had no hope. You were not even close to Israel.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   There was nothing for you.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   This is who the Gentiles were. These Gentiles should hang their heads in shame."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And yet Paul is spinning this in a positive light.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Paul tells them, "Remember that this is who you were." This is past tense.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   So if you look back at Ephesians 2, verses 1 through 3,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   it's a reminder that this is just a reminder of the gospel, right?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and were by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind."
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And here it is.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   "But God, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Now what's cool here is that in Ephesians 2, verses 1 through 3, it is given to the church.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   In Ephesians 2, verses 11 through 13, he is specifically addressing Gentiles.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And in verse 4, this "But God, even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   he made us alive together with Christ."
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And then he's focusing in on these Gentiles.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   "And now with the fall there came a division between us and God, and us and one another."
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And before we can address us and one another and the application of this sermon,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   is that we need to address this divide between us and God.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And he says then, verse 13, that we are now unified with God.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And this is our second point today.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   We are unified with God.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Look down with me at Ephesians 2, verse 13.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It says, "But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   have been brought near by the blood of Christ."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Still talking to the Gentiles.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   "You who are far away have been brought near."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And those first two words again, "But now" show up, just as in Ephesians 4.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   God inserts himself and injects himself and intercedes.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And through Christ, through Jesus,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   "You who once were far off have been brought near by Christ's blood."
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   This is his blood.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   This is what his death did.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   His death did something miraculous.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   His death, it wasn't just God saying, "Come.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Here's peace. Just walk over to me.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I forgive.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I give you kindness and compassion.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Just come."
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And we come groveling over.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   No, no.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   This is something amazing and miraculous
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   because what was able to bridge that divide was the blood of Christ.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It drew forward Gentiles who were separated from Christ.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   It brought hope to the hopeless people.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   To these Gentiles who are alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   strangers to the covenant of hope,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   people without hope and without God.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   This is radical that God would draw near not just sinners, but these Gentiles.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   These dirty, sinful, pagan people who should have nothing to do with the God of Israel.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   This is scandalous stuff, shocking and horrifying stuff
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   that Paul is bringing up here to these people.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That God would draw near Gentile sinners.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   If you could think back with me to the story of the leper,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   where Jesus approaches the leper.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I remember these Jews, lepers, just physically lepers were rotting.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   They were just walking dead.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   But not only that, in Jewish culture, lepers were seen as so unclean.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   If you even get anywhere near them, if you touch anything they touch,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   you have to actually go outside the walls of the city
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and you have to do all these different things.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   You have to be moved away.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It was from day one when they're born, from that moment on as they're growing up,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   the parents are saying, "When you see a leper, you go."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And so that's what you grow up with is dirty, unclean people.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Not only that, the lepers themselves have to walk around yelling.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   This is the saddest thing, right?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You have to walk around saying, "Unclean, unclean,"
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   showing everybody that they're unclean.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   This is inherent in them.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Day one, it was just built into them.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   How dirty a leper is.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And here comes Jesus and draws near to this leper.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   You can hear the audible gasp of all the Jews that are surrounding.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   They're probably watching this in a circle that spans wide
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   because they don't want to get too close.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And here they see Jesus reaching out to touch the leper.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And as striking as that picture is,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   God, a creator God, drawing near Gentile sinners to himself was far worse.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Even for us, we don't like going near dirty, unclean things.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Like if you go to a fast food restaurant, what do you do?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   You look at all the tables, and when you see dirty stuff on there,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   you pass on to the next table.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You don't want to have that.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   When you're walking into a room,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   perhaps with a co-worker or something like that,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and they're coughing into their arm, and it sounds kind of bad,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   what do you do?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   You don't want to be there.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   You don't walk away.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   They're unclean, right?
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It's dirty.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And there's something about dirtiness that makes you want to--
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   like if you touch the hand of someone that had a dirty hand,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   you want to wash it.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   There's something about it that actually causes a tangible division.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   It was interesting.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   As I was doing the sermon, as I was preparing and meditating on this passage,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I was at a Starbucks, and then at the Starbucks, two homeless men walked in.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And as these two homeless men walked in, it was like instantaneously
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   that Starbucks was filled with a stench.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And this is not to be mocking or anything like that.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   It was just as soon as they walked in, all eyes just turned on them,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and I just looked around because I was like, "This is interesting,"
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   because I was studying something like uncleanness and things like that.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So as I was watching, I was looking at people's faces,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and they would grimace.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   They'd go like this.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Just all around.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Everyone could see it, but they didn't think.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I was just so captivated by these two homeless men that I walked in.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And their clothes were pretty raggy, and they came and sat kind of off to the side of me.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And as I was sitting there, I was thinking about it.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I'm like, "You know, division is like immediate."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It's nothing they did.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   There's just something where as soon as they walked in,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   there was this big divide between the two homeless men and everybody else.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Three people actually got up and walked to the other side of the Starbucks.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And for me, I was just observing this whole time.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I'm like, "Oh, you know, what's interesting is even me,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   I'm looking at them, and I could feel this division,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   even a type of tension in the room."
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   That's something about this understanding of uncleanness,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   where it creates judgment between people,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   judgment between me and another person.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And it's not just uncleanness.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   It's just this understanding of something that's so different.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   We're like that as humans, fallen in sin.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   We want to move away from people that are unlike us.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And we want to move away from people who don't agree with us.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   And we want to move away from people who make us feel certain ways.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   But here is God.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   He draws the vilest of people to himself before him.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And he does it in the most heinous way possible,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   through the blood of his son.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   What this means is that the creator himself,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   infinitely of value and worth, exalted in heaven,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   glorious of immense worth, magnitude and gravity of who he is
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and his holiness and righteousness, filling everything.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   The God who is able to create the world with the power of his word
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   would give his own life in obedience to the Father
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and sacrifice himself for the filth of the world
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and draw near people in that manner.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   We don't deserve this, but he extends it to us.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And so if you look down at verse 14, it says,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   "For he himself is our peace."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   It's talking about Jesus.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He doesn't just give us peace.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He doesn't just give us unity.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   He doesn't just hand us medicine.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   He doesn't just hand us a solution.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   He himself is the medicine.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   He himself is the solution is what he's saying here.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's the same reason why in John 14, verse 6,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Jesus says, "Not that I will provide a way to the Father."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   He says, "I am the way."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   In John 10, verse 9, he doesn't say, "I will open the gate for you."
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He says, "I am the gate."
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   That this is the only way, that I am the only object
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   by which a vile sinner, unclean, can be drawn near to God.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   He is saying he himself is the answer,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   the only way to unity with the Father.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   There is no other way.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Christ alone, he himself is our peace.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   That means that without Christ, there is no other way to find peace.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Peace is found in Christ alone.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   We can find cheap substitutes for peace,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   but there is no peace apart from him.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   God needs to extend his hand down
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   to repair a broken relationship that has caused death to fall upon humanity.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Now this is where the rubber meets the road as we think of unity with people.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Ultimately, even though the theological anchor here
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   is the unity between us and God,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   the outpouring is being talked about with one another, with people.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   We as Christians, and we as a church,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   are called to live in unity and harmony.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   We are called to pursue reconciliation with one another here at church,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   but also wherever we go.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Every Christian, what's cool about the church, I think,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   is if you kind of imagine, we're all gathered here,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   but we scatter during the week.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   We go to so many places with influences, with so many people,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and we are called to pursue peace.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Now some of you might be thinking, "Well, didn't Jesus say he came to bring not peace but division?"
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And that's not the type of thing that we're talking about right now.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   So we can study on that or talk about that another day.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   But the type of peace and harmony is being talked about,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   about the extension of the gospel here.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   We are to be different as Christians,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   not because we are nice people or sophisticated in our compassionate philosophy,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   but because God drew us near to him by the blood of his Son,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   because Jesus is our peace.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And this is the reason why in Matthew chapter 5, it says something about sons of God.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   In Matthew 5 it says, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's kind of like DNA of what a Christian is to look like,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that we are called to be peacemakers.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   That people, when they look at us, whether they be a believer or a non-believer,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   they say, "That is a child of God. That is a son. That is a daughter of God,"
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   because they are pursuers of peace.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   So this brings us to our third point, we are unified with others.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   If you look down with me at verse 14 and 15,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   it says this, that he breaks down the dividing wall of hostility.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   He himself is our peace, who has made us both one,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Now that terminology being used here, dividing wall of hostility,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   probably brought to their mind an immediate picture for the audience here,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   and it brought a picture of the temple.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   If you can kind of imagine a temple with me,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   there was a rectangular piece of land that had this high wall.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   So if you wanted to worship Yahweh, you would go through those doors.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And there is a place called the Court of the Gentiles,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   where even Gentiles could come in.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Inside of there is where people would trade and things like that.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   We know of the story of Jesus who overturned tables. That is where it was.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And then beyond that, inside of this rectangular plot,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   there was a smaller rectangular, elevated about five feet,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   with a five-feet wall elevated up.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   People would have to go up a staircase to go into this area.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And written in big, bold letters, I will just summarize it for you,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   is, "If you're a Gentile, don't come in here. You will die."
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And they had this thought.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   When Paul is saying, "For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   and broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility,"
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   this is probably what was being talked about here,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   You should remember, Paul is writing a lot of these letters in jail.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And one of the reasons why he went to jail in Acts 21 is because
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   people accused him of taking a Gentile into the court of the Jews.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And so Paul was familiar with this,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and there was a deep understanding of this divide between Jews and Gentiles,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   even during this time.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And so for the Jews, this was a radical statement.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Like, "Paul, what are you trying to say here?"
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Paul is trying to emphasize an even greater statement that both Jews and Gentiles
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   are allowed into something greater, and this is what we mean.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Now, if you go a little bit deeper, you have the court of the Gentiles,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   you have the court of the Jews, and then in the middle you have this holy place.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   This place is a rectangular, tiny piece, cut in half,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   and there's a curtain that would separate the holy place,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   the most holy place, the holy of holies.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And the reason why there used to be a curtain there
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   is because it divided humanity from God.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And so they would send priests in there,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and sometimes they would tie a rope to the priest just in case he died in the presence of God,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   and they would have to drag his body out.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   There's this understanding that God could not allow his presence to be with people
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   because of this deep divide, this deep void between humanity and God due to sin.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But what happened when Jesus dies?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   We hear about this great curtain inside of this place that tears in two,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   and this curtain is no more, that there is no longer any divide between us and God.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   This is a mind-blowing statement.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   What does that mean?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   How can our presence mingle and cohabitate with God?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   How can God allow people into his presence?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And in Hebrews chapter 4, when it talks about the fact that we're able to draw into his throne of grace.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   How? What is it being talked about when in Colossians 1,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   it says that the mystery of the gospel is Christ in me?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   What is that?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   This understanding of the fact that we are now called temples of God,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   that the Spirit is sealed into us.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   God has broken down this dividing wall of hostility between us and humanity.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   He is drawing both Jew and Gentile.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Why is it that if he draws a Jew and he draws a Gentile,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   that there is a dividing wall of hostility between you?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   So we talked about in the beginning about why there's so much disunity in the world.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   It's because the world and the people in it, due to sin, are separated from God.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Because here's the thing.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   If we want to see peace in this world, there's only one way.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And that's through Jesus.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   There is no other way.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And so the world pursues peace, but without Christ, there is no peace.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And so then how is peace to go to the world?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Through his people.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Through people who have received peace.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   As a kid, we used to drive to church, and I would pass this church called the Church of the Nazarene.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I don't know what kind of church it was or anything like that, but always on a sign it said,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "No Jesus, no peace." The N-O.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And then it said right below that, "No Jesus," K-N-O-W, "no peace."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I'd be like, "Ah, I see what you did. That's cool."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And we passed by that, and then I would think about it later on in life.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   I'm like, "Man, that was really profound."
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   There is no peace in this world apart from Jesus.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   In Isaiah 9, verse 6, following the holidays, we know this verse,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   "For to us a son is born, to us a child is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Jesus is peace. Jesus is the way peace was extended to us by God.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And so Jesus himself is the one that kills hostility between us and God,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and gives us the ability to kill hostility amongst one another.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   That when we know this great peace and reconciliation and unity that we enjoy with our Creator,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   and when this truth is instilled into our hearts, the power of knowing that kind of peace is tremendous.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   That the very way we live will change, it gives us the ability to be able to forgive and love one another in the way that we're called to.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   This world says about marriages that it's supposed to be a 50/50 relationship.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   One side, husband gets 50%, wife gets 50%.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   If the husband isn't giving enough, then the wife has a means to say, "Hey, you're doing bad."
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And vice versa, so it becomes a tug of war.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "You said you would put your socks away in the laundry hamper, and you didn't."
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   So there is reason for conflict. There is self-justification for anger, and bitterness, and resentment.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   You pick it up one day, two days, three days, by the end of the week you're like, "I'm done with this."
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Because we think about, in this world, we think about 50/50. There has to be a give and take.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   But the type of reconciliation, the type of peace that we're called to pursue is that of what God gave to us.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   And that means that it is something where the vilest of people were reached down to.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   That people who are far off were reached 100% unconditionally.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   On the basis of the condition that all of it, all of the sin was paid for by Christ.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   It is the same rallying cry for us as a Christian, claiming that we're believers who have received this kind of peace.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It doesn't matter if someone loves us back. It doesn't matter what another believer does to you or says about you,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   or how it makes you feel. You are making a commitment to love them 100%.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   With the love of God, you are called to make peace with others because you know the peace of Christ.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Because you know Christ. You have been given peace, now you go and give peace and you make peace.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   There is nothing that should be able to divide up the body of Christ.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   There is only supreme love that pursues reconciliation and peace.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Now this unifying of believers isn't just people coexisting.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Because I think that's what we think peace is a lot of times.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I think it's just coexisting with one another. And it's not. It's much deeper than that.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   If you look down at verse 15 again, you're going to see that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   So making peace and might reconcile us both to God and one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   See there's a couple things going on here.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   It says that he is creating one man where there used to be two.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And that should kind of draw to your mind something. You should be thinking about husband and wife.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   This is intimate language being used here.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Where there was once two, there is now one.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   This is a deep unity. And this is what Christ's peace does.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   It's not coexisting. It's not just going through the motions.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   There is a deep, deep unity that is found in the people of God.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Our pursuit of peace needs to mimic that of what has happened between us and God.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   We can go around and pursue cheap substitutes of the true peace of Christ.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   We can pretend like nothing's wrong. We're good at that, aren't we?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   Not a big deal. And we try to trick ourselves into thinking that. Not a big deal.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   We can be passive aggressive. We're really good at that one.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   It's passive aggressive and pursuing justice.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   We come up with the weirdest ways to make ourselves feel better.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   We can smile at someone in front of them. We can smile in our hearts.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   We're saying, "I despise you."
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   We can avoid people or situations. We can duck them.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But this is not real peace.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   That doesn't show our understanding of and apprehension of the gospel.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Peace goes deep and is transformative.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Would you look down with me on verse 17 and 18?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Paul says, "And He came and preached peace to you who are far off, and peace to those who are near.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   For through Him we both have access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   This distinction between the Jew and Gentile, again he's talking about it being torn down,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   that both would be brought near.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   That Jesus preached the same gospel of peace to those who are far off, the Gentiles,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   and those who are near, the Jews.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And again you can hear the audible gasp of the Jews.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   They're allowed into the presence of the Father too?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   This is revolutionary and powerful that the Gentile would be brought from so far
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   all the way into direct access to the Father.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And we see someone doing the action of this pulling of humanity to God.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   That Jesus is doing the action.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   All the verbs used there, brought near.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Jesus is the one that brought us near.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Jesus is the one that made us both one.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Jesus is the one that creates in Himself.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Jesus is the one who reconciles.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Jesus is the one who preaches peace.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   And that's the grace portion.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   He did all the work.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   We reaped all the benefits.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And now we are called to do likewise.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Now what does that mean?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   If God did all the work and we reap all the benefits and we turn to our neighbor
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   and we look at them and say, "Well, you need to do this in order for you to receive my peace."
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   There's something very, very twisted and disturbing about that kind of picture.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   We know about the parable of the unforgiving servant who is forgiven of much
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   and he turns around and he can't forgive his brother.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   It's sick.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   And yet this is much of how we live when we look at certain people.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   You have been forgiven. Go and forgive.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   You have been loved. Go and love.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   That is the call to us.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And so back to verse 11, we are called to remember this.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   A Christian who forgets will wallow in disunity and demand justice for himself.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   A Christian who remembers will pursue unity and reconciliation and love and harmony.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   I mean, this is so hard.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Even on the freeways we like to do that.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   "That guy cut me off. I've got to box him in or something."
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   There's something about us, wired in us, that we demand stuff.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   God has done it to those who are close and far.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   He doesn't pick favorites. He preaches peace for all people.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And so we are called to go and preach peace to all people.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   He reminds us what you have been given.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Look at the amazing words again in verse 19.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Now we're going cyclical here.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Now we're going back to again what we've received from God.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   In verse 19, he says, "You are no longer strangers and aliens, but fellow citizens, saints,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   members of household of God.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   You are adopted and chosen by God.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   You are loved by Him.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   For the Jew to hear this is like, 'What?'
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Gentiles like, 'Yeah!'"
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   In Ephesians chapter 1, we see a lot of things.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Remember who you were.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   In chapter 1, verse 3, it tells us of our blessings.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   That we have been blessed in Christ with every spiritual blessing.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   In verse 4, He chose you.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   In verse 5, He predestined you for adoption.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   In verse 7, He redeemed and forgave you, and lavishly so.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   In verse 10, there is a plan for uniting between heaven and earth.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   We get all of these things.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And so here's the application, because even though this is my first week here,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I've been hearing from Pastor Peter and Pastor Mark some of the things going on.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And one of the things that they told me is that for this year,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   we really want to concentrate on applying the truth that we know.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Now this is where, again, the rubber meets the road, and it becomes very hard.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   This is a tough one today, because we are called to go out and pursue peace and reconciliation with others.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And this is to be a lifestyle.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   We are called to seek people out the very way we were sought out by God.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   If how God has sought us out and saved us brings you any joy,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   then that kind of joy needs to propel us into a life of extending that kind of peace with others.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Think about Ephesians 2, verses 1-10.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   All of these great gospel truths that make you weep.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   It's like, "Wow! You saved us when I was here.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   You saved me even though I didn't deserve it.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   You gave me grace, and you lavished it upon me.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And now I have hope for living."
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   And then in verse 11, less of us know of this passage, Anon,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   but it's the direct application of what it's called to look like, a uniting of people.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   It's hard, because we don't want to pursue reconciliation.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I'm pretty sure right now you can think of one or two, maybe three people in your life
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   that you need to reconcile with, right?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   It's not that hard.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Someone that God actually kind of places on your heart, and you feel a little guilty about it.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Why might you not want to pursue them?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Just for several reasons.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   First, you think it's of no use.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   You think they'll never change.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   But we know that's not true.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   We know the power of the gospel.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And when we think that way, we shortchange the power of the Spirit
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   and the power of the Word of God, that God will melt hearts and break hearts.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Secondly, we might be lazy.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   It's too much effort to reconcile with someone, to pursue peace.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   I have so much going on in my life right now.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   How can I have any capacity at all for this?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   It takes too much prayer to constantly pray about this, and it boils me inside.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   But that kind of lazy living is supremely unloving of others and supremely loving of self,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   especially if God has placed them on your heart.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Thirdly, it's uncomfortable.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   You just don't like to feel the ache of conflict.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   That's why we like to avoid conflict and duck people.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   There's this person at my former church that we ended up reconciling,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   but there was a time when I just didn't want to see him.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   I was like, "We're going to argue about this. He's going to say this."
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   So I would kind of duck away.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   I did that for a couple of weeks until I knew I shouldn't.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   But we like to do that. It's just uncomfortable.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Like the one before, it's very selfish, loving of self and unloving of others to do this.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Fourthly, you might be impatient.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   This is a partner to laziness.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   You want to put in the effort once, right?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   That's the type of society we live in.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   We put in something, and something comes out. We want that.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   And so since we don't see immediate results, we don't think that it's worth it.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   There is no instant fix to this.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   So we don't pursue peace.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And fifthly, I think this is the main culprit for us all.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   It's pride.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   We are proud people. We don't want to admit our own mistakes
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and do the deep work of unraveling it and confessing it to someone.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's incredibly humbling having to do this.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   Or maybe you don't want to hear the other party kind of like,
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   "They don't admit their wrongs."
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   So you say, "I'm sorry."
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   And then what do you want in return?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   You want to hear, "I'm sorry," back.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   If they don't say it, like, "Ahh!"
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   We're proud.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   We will say, "Sorry," only if we get that back.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   It infuriates us.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   But we are called to pursue peace.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   When there is no peace with someone, it really ends up doing something to our souls.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   It dilutes the gospel truth in our own life of the peace that God has given to us,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   the forgiveness and love that God has extended to us.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   God went to the bitter end in his pursuit of peace with us.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   And it costs the life of Jesus.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Who are we to say that we won't go the distance to pursue peace with others?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   How can we as Christians do that?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   That we sing these songs on Sundays, and we go to Bible studies,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   and we read our scripture passages every morning, and we pray all the time,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   and yet there is this dark side of our soul that just wants to keep this part hidden,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   and I don't want to touch it.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   It's just, "Ahh!"
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   We say, "You're not worth pursuing peace with for whatever reason."
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   And when we say that, we're showing a lack of understanding of our great sin before God
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and what we ourselves have been forgiven of.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   So, Berean, we must go and pursue peace.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   You might ask, "Who do I do this for?"
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   What if they don't want to be pursued?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   What if they want nothing to do with me?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   You still pursue it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   You obviously can't do this with every person in your life,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   but you begin with one, maybe two people.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Don't throw everyone out with a baby with bathwater, okay?
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Don't be like, "Well, I can't pursue peace with everyone,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   so I will pursue peace with only no one."
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   God places people in our hearts, and in those steps of faith,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   when we pursue peace with them, God sanctifies us
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   and develops in us a heart and lifestyle of a peacemaker.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Even if that person doesn't want anything to do with you,
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   doesn't even want your forgiveness or to forgive you,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   you can still pursue in the spirit of peace,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and actually that deepens your understanding of the gospel
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   and what was happening between us and God.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   We can't go into all the details of it,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   but I wanted to give just a practical resource.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's called "The Peacemaker," written by Ken Sandy.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   I think it's a really helpful resource
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   if you want to pursue reconciliation with someone.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   It's something to look into.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   So, church, this is the last application.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Other than all the reconciliation you must pursue with people in your life,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   I would like for Berean to be a church and a place
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   where we pursue peace with one another.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   I'm a newcomer coming in, and I don't know anything
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   of what's going on in here, honestly.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   So don't think I'm singling anything out right now. I'm not.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   I'm just talking about what the Bible says here
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   about what a church is to look like.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   We must pursue unity, and if there's any bitterness
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   or resentment or jealousy or hatred
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   that is at the core of your heart when you're thinking of somebody
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   or something or a policy or whatever it might be,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   all of these different things, whether you're right or wrong,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   whether they're right or wrong, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   We are called to pursue peace here.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   We are called to do it, to pursue reconciliation
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   in a wise and biblical manner,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   with counsel of godly people around us
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   who are able to fill our blind spots.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   But we have to be bold here
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   and never let the enemy have a foothold here in this church.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Like a weed, when the smallest sprout
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   kind of sprouts up out of the soil,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   you know that the roots have already been growing for a long time.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   We need to uproot all of these things.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   If we see anything on the externals,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   that means there's a lot going down underneath.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Know that when the church pursues peace,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   when we go into the hard conversations of confronting one another
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   and sharpening one another in this way,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   this is when the church actually really begins
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   to deepen in the understanding of the gospel.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   We practice it.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   We don't just pretend like everything's okay
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   and we hold hands and we just continue along.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   We just come to services and Bible studies and things like that.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   But we really dive deep into one another.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   I hope that we can do that
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   and that this church, Beruian, can be a church
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   that's filled with the testimony of the gospel of God's peace given to us.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Let's pray.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Dear God,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   You have forgiven us of much.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   You have redeemed us.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   You have atoned for our sins through the very blood of Jesus.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   You have given us peace through Him.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   And so God, help us to be Christians
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   and a church that will pursue peace with one another
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   and then go out into the world and pursue peace with others.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   And Father, help us to do this.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   I pray for conviction.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I pray, God, that we would actually begin to pursue people
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   that You've placed into our hearts,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   in this room as well as outside,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   our families, our friends, our co-workers.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   And Father, we do this with much prayer,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   much reading of Scripture, much counsel,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   and that we would become people
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   who really are peacemakers in our lives.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
