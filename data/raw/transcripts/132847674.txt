[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   Okay, let me pray for us and then we'll jump into the message this morning.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.600]   We thank you for this morning.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.520]   We thank you, Lord God, that your love has caused us to open our eyes to see the truth
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.960]   of what it is that we have.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.080]   And we know, Father, that even our understanding of the Gospel is because you've been gracious
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.080]   to us.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.400]   I pray, Father, God, that your Holy Spirit would continue to convict, renew, strengthen,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.680]   and revive us, Lord God, for the sake of your name.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.040]   We pray that the power of your Holy Spirit would be real this morning, that your word
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.100]   would go forth and it would convict us, revive us, encourage us, Lord God, to run this race
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520]   with perseverance.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.960]   So we pray, Father, for your grace.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   We pray for your Holy Spirit.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   Amen.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.560]   >> You know, a few years back I was helping a doctor friend of mine move from one apartment
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.920]   to another place.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.800]   And then he had a bunch of his doctor friends come.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.600]   And I got in a conversation with one of the doctors who was an oncologist.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740]   And in the context of the conversation, I asked him, "It must be really hard for you
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.840]   because part of your job is to tell people that they have cancer.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.300]   And oftentimes when they find out about it, it's too late.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.660]   And so part of their job is to sit down and counsel families and tell them to prepare
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.320]   for the end and that death is coming."
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.280]   And I asked him, "It must be really difficult.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   How do you not bring that home?"
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.240]   And he said, "You know, after a while you just become numb to it."
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.360]   You know, he said sometimes he would actually sit, he would have his colleagues who would
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   go in and tell somebody, "You have three months to live."
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.040]   And then they would come outside and they would just joke and laugh like nothing happened.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   And he said that that's very common in the oncology department.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.680]   So not to say that every doctor is that way, but he says that that's how they've learned
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.760]   to deal with what they have to do on a regular basis.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.720]   And obviously it would be very encouraging to be able to help somebody who is sick and
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.440]   to be able to heal them with the medicine.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.020]   But oftentimes that's not the case.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.880]   But again, it was surprising to me how callous we can become toward life and death.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.600]   But as I was thinking about that, I think about how even spiritually we can become so
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.160]   callous in the way that we live our Christian lives, where our doctrine and our life is
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.560]   so segregated and separate that we say tremendous things up on the pulpit in our daily, in our
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.840]   praises and our Bible studies and memorizing scripture.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.020]   But it doesn't always reflect in the way that we live our lives.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.560]   We know if you are a believer, biblical believer of the gospel of Jesus Christ, part of the
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.360]   gospel tells us not only are we going to be saved, but he says judgment is coming to the
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   world.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.880]   Matthew 13, 49 to 15.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.120]   So it will be at the close of the age, the angels will come out and separate the evil
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.800]   from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.920]   In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for every single individual in this
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   room who professes to believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ must embrace that too.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.440]   You can't just pick and choose certain parts of scripture that I believe.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.560]   And if you, again, if you confess your faith in Jesus Christ, that this is part of your
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.920]   confession that there is judgment waiting for those who have not been, since have not
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   been atoned for.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.720]   In fact, he said, the judgment is so severe in Mark chapter 9, 42 through 50.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.480]   He says, if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.280]   It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.440]   quenchable fire, unquenchable fire.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.520]   He said, this judgment is so hideous that it would be better to have your limbs cut
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.480]   off than to allow that limb to drag you into hell.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.880]   Verse 45, if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.400]   It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.440]   If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.360]   Is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.440]   thrown into hell, where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched, for everyone
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.640]   will be salted with fire.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.880]   I know in our generation that we try to shy away from passages of judgment because it
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   rocks our world.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   We don't know what to do with it.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.300]   It's not a message that we would like to share.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.320]   We want to highlight the grace and love of God, but yet at the same time, the scripture
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.920]   makes it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.800]   The reason why we are in dire need of grace is because of the judgment that is coming.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.880]   It is not because we have a hard time living.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.720]   It's not because we are lonely.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.840]   It's not because we want to have hope that when we die, we're going to go to heaven.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.640]   All of these things may be true, but at the core of why we need the mercy of God and the
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.400]   atonement of Jesus Christ is because the scripture says there's judgment waiting for those who
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.920]   are not saved.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.280]   And so we celebrate as men and women who have been saved from this fire, from this
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.540]   judgment.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.840]   And yet, I think we have to say, we have to honestly admit that at times we're no different
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.120]   than some of the oncologists that we talked about where we can talk about all of this,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.600]   hear this, maybe even be shocked a little bit for a momentary time, and then we go out
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.320]   that door and we just click it off.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   We just click it off.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   We talk about it sometimes.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.080]   We maybe share it in Bible study, but we turn it off when we go to work.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:15.600]   We turn it off sometimes even with other Christians because the reality of what this message says,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.000]   what the reality that is pictured for us in scripture is too heavy to bear.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.120]   So we choose to become callous.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.560]   We choose to marginalize some doctrines in order that we may live a peaceful and quiet
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.520]   life.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.800]   Psychologists actually has a term for this.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.720]   They call it hedonic adaptation.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   Hedonic adaptation.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.920]   Basically what hedonic adaptation is that we have a tendency that if we share, no matter
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.840]   how shocking of bad or good news it is, eventually we become numb to the news and we kind of
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.560]   learn to adapt and kind of coast along.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.240]   This is basically what it says.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.800]   Hedonic adaptation is a mental habit of overstimulation of certain things which eventually becomes
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   mundane.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.080]   Once it becomes mundane, we become insensitive to hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting what
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.960]   is around us.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.040]   Sometimes it is called hedonic treadmill.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.600]   It's kind of like when we're riding on a treadmill, we don't think.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   It just goes.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.160]   Because it's going, you just go along with it.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   But you're not really meditating.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   You're not really thinking.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.160]   And that's what that psychological state is.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.360]   Where you've heard the message so many times, where we don't think much about it.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   In fact, we become dull.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.480]   That's why Jesus Christ, whenever he said something of significance, remember he says,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.620]   he who has ears, let him hear.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.720]   Who doesn't have ears?
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   Who can't hear?
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.600]   He's talking about an individual who has become so numb to the truth of God that when the
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:08:03.880]   Lord himself, the Son of God himself is speaking the truth, they could not hear him.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   Maybe there's certain things that we do that we kind of have to learn to turn off the consequence.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Maybe.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.340]   You know, I can understand that.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.240]   Maybe if you're a police officer and you're seeing horrendous things, that you've got
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.880]   to learn to turn that off when you come home.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.080]   Maybe if you're an oncologist, you have to learn to turn that off and not to be able
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.680]   to have a normal life.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.920]   But as a Christian, when our heart is not engaged with the things that we profess, we
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.520]   can no longer be worshipers of God.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:36.640]   Because you and I know that worship is more than what we do physically in this room.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.840]   In fact, if you remember the Old Testament, God deliberately, he forsakes Saul and he
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   chooses David, but his rationale behind why he chooses David to lead his people, again,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.400]   it's explained in Acts 13.22.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.880]   He says, "He raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.040]   in David, the son of Jesse, the man after my own heart.'"
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.720]   He says he chooses David because he sees beyond the surface and he sees what's in his heart.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.500]   And here's a man who knows my heart.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:16.800]   And as a result of that, he says, he's a man after my own heart, "who will do all my will."
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.920]   The one who does his will is the one who understands his heart.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.900]   You and I cannot disengage.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.600]   If we have a callous heart, it affects even the way that we understand scripture.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:38.320]   What comes through this morning is also contingent upon the condition of your heart.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.680]   What you receive and reject, what seems reasonable and unreasonable, what seems fair and unfair
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.120]   is directly linked to the condition of our heart.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:55.400]   See, the scripture says that you and I receive the mercy of God because he had compassion
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.320]   on us.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.520]   He didn't act simply logically because it would be logical that you and I be punished
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.800]   for our sins.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.440]   It would only be just if God, a holy God, looked at his creation and said, "These people
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.400]   are rebelling against me, dragging my name through the mud," that they deserve judgment.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.680]   So what the scripture says, he had compassion.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.920]   Hosea 11 verse 8, he describes a relationship with his people where they keep forsaking
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:32.580]   him to seek after idols, but he says, "I will be patient with Israel because of my compassion."
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:39.280]   In Micah 7, 19, he says, "Israel is receiving the judgment of God," but he says, "I will
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.880]   not remain in my judgment because I have compassion."
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.580]   In fact, in Psalm 103, 10 through 13, our salvation is described this way.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.920]   He does not deal with us according to our sins nor repay us according to our iniquities,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.180]   for as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.940]   who fear him.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.920]   As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.900]   as a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.240]   fear him.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.400]   It is because of his compassion toward us that you and I are here.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   And that's why when he looks at his people, he desires us to be compassionate, that we
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.500]   are not callous.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:35.480]   In fact, if you look at scripture, everything God does is an act of compassion.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.240]   In Matthew 14, 14, it says, "When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.440]   on them and healed their sick."
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.840]   He wasn't simply like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.920]   I'm God and I need to be obligated."
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.200]   He said, "He looked upon them and he had compassion."
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.660]   Matthew 15, 32, it talks about why he fed the 5,000.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.740]   We know that he did it to prove his identity.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.780]   We know that he did it because it was at the peak of his success, but his underlying emotional
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.540]   motive said he had compassion.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:14.540]   It was compassion in Mark 1, 40, why he healed the leopards, it says.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:20.180]   It was because of his compassion, he healed the demon-possessed in Mark chapter 5.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:26.460]   It was because he had compassion in Luke 7, 11, that he had compassion for the widow of
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.460]   Nain.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:34.040]   The two blind men mentioned in Matthew 20, 30, 34, is because he had compassion.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.020]   Why is this so important?
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:46.540]   Because if we confess that there is hell and judgment waiting, and I know that, again,
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.180]   in our culture, that we don't want to talk about this because it makes people feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.100]   Life is difficult as it is.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.780]   You don't know what it is like at my work.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.440]   You don't know what my family is like.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.900]   You don't know the trouble that I'm in.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.340]   So we don't want to be at church and talk about heavy things.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:09.980]   But we would be lying to ourselves if all we do is pick and choose the things that makes
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.420]   us feel comfortable.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:20.620]   And you choose to marginalize things that are clearly spelled out in Scripture for us.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.940]   How can we not have compassion?
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.180]   The opposite of compassion is callousness.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.140]   Callousness is described this way in the dictionary.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.740]   It's a synonym for the word "callous-are."
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.660]   To cauterize.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.580]   Be thick-skinned.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.980]   To be hardened.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   Insensitive.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.860]   Deadened feelings.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.740]   Indifference to suffering.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.740]   Cold-blooded.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.620]   Emotionally hardened.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.820]   Jesus said to His disciples, Matthew 8, 17 and 21, when He was teaching them about Himself
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.860]   as the bread and how He was going to go to the cross, He was frustrated with them.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:07.180]   But in the way He described why they weren't able to understand, He says, "Do you not understand
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.140]   why have you become so hardened?"
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.060]   Their ability to even understand what Jesus was saying was because of their hardened heart.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.340]   In 2 Corinthians 3, 14, He talks about the Jews.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.140]   Why they were rejecting the Messiah.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.180]   He said, "But their minds were hardened.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.620]   For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted because only
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.620]   through Christ is it taken away."
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.740]   The whole reason why they rejected the Messiah is because their hearts were hardened.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.020]   And they chose to harden it.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.180]   Hebrews 3, 13, "We are warned to persevere in our faith."
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.980]   And this is how the perseverance, encouragement to persevere is explained.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:59.780]   "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.860]   by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.940]   Paul says in Acts 24, 16, "I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   and man."
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.620]   Now before, when I used to read that term, to have a clear conscience, I just automatically
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.660]   assumed he's talking about the way he lived his life.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.820]   And I think that is a huge part of it.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.180]   There's no way you can take that part out.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.900]   But have a clear conscience is more than what you do physically.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:34.280]   Is more than just a checkoff list to come and say, "I did this, this, this, and this."
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.800]   How do we recognize if our hearts are not callous?
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.860]   If we are simply fans of Jesus Christ, if we're simply fans of Jesus Christ, we don't
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.140]   need to keep our eyes on Christ all the time.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.180]   Just do it every once in a while.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.660]   Maybe once a Sunday, maybe at Bible study, maybe in small group.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.000]   But we don't need to fix our eyes upon Christ all the time.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.400]   If we're just simply fans of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.260]   But if we're followers of Jesus Christ, the moment we take our eyes off of Christ, we
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.940]   are lost.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:18.540]   There's three instances in the scripture where the Bible describes three sets of people,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.940]   three groups or three different churches that have hardened their hearts toward God and
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.840]   become callous.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.880]   The first is the Hebrews.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.100]   And the book of Hebrews is written to these people who are drifting away from God because
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.580]   their hearts were becoming hardened.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.500]   The second group of people were the Ephesians, the church of Ephesus, written in Revelation.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.620]   And he said, "These people were doing all the things that are externally correct, but
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.140]   they have forsaken their first love."
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.160]   And then a third group of people mentioned in the scripture are the Laodiceans.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.460]   These are people who become so hardened that they felt like they didn't even need Christ.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.940]   And obviously the greatest rebuke goes to the Laodicean church.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:05.820]   Each one of these churches had a reason why they were hardened and became callous.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:12.260]   The Hebrews, these are people at one point were passionately and excited for God.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.420]   But they took their eyes off of Christ and they weren't deliberately denying Christ and
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.860]   they weren't running toward their old life.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.820]   They were just drifting.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.620]   It just, they got tired of holding on.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.060]   And it got harder.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:35.260]   So basically what happened was they just drifted back into their old way of life, the Judaizers.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:43.020]   And that's why the whole book of Hebrews is to convince them the consequences of drifting,
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.900]   allowing your heart to cauterize, to become hardened toward the things of God.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.820]   And so he reminds them systematically that Jesus is greater than the angels, greater
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.860]   than Moses, greater than the prophets, greater than the priesthood, greater than the sacrifice
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   itself.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.300]   And the covenant is a greater covenant than the old covenant.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:11.860]   See the book of Ephesians, these people on the surface would seem like a great church.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:19.660]   You know, and oftentimes it's a lot easier to just be religious because all we have to
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.900]   do is do the right thing.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:28.700]   Just go to church, pay your tithe, serve the church a little bit here and there, you know,
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.780]   do what's required.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.020]   But he says you have forsaken your first love.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.240]   He said you have forsaken, he didn't say you lost it, he didn't say you dropped it.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.060]   He said you have forsaken it.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.480]   Why would somebody forsake their first love?
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.300]   Why would they choose to be callous?
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   Because it's easier.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.460]   Because it's easier.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:04.540]   If we remain soft in our heart and eager to listen and eager to obey, it will rock your
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.740]   world.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.920]   The gospel will force you to take a look at your spending.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.900]   The gospel will force to look at yourself in the way you spend your time.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.400]   And so when we take a step back and we recognize the spiritual reality that is painted for
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.260]   us in scripture, it is easier for us to compartmentalize that into church and non-churched.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.940]   So it is easier for me to live my secular life without having to think about these things.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.920]   But when the reality of heaven and hell is real in the way that we live on a day-to-day
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.800]   basis, it's much harder to live your life.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.980]   So we choose to be callous.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.660]   We choose to compartmentalize.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.100]   "Well, that's pastor, you know, of course it's easy for you because you're a full-time
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.100]   pastor, right?
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.100]   Of course it's easy.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.320]   Well, you don't know me, you don't know my job, you don't know how difficult it is."
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.620]   And we tend to rationalize everything.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:07.900]   Basically, what we're rationalizing is a secular life.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.220]   He says to the Ephesians church, "You have forsaken your first love."
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.400]   And third and finally, the lay of the sins.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.100]   These are people who are so callous, and there's no mention of wrong doctrine necessarily.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.980]   There's no mention of immorality necessarily.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.460]   It's just that their salvation was their wealth.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:33.180]   Here was a church who maybe on the surface looked like Christians, but at the core of
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.980]   what they believed and what they pursued and what brought joy into their life had nothing
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.300]   to do with Christ.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.060]   So even though they may not have verbally said, "I don't need you, Christ," Jesus sees
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.420]   right through that.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:52.880]   He says, "You are lukewarm, and I'll spew you out of my mouth."
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.700]   But if you look at all three situations, the solution is the same.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.420]   With Hebrews, it says to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.060]   With the Ephesians, consider the height in which you had fallen.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.740]   Remember the first time when you met Christ, when you first heard the gospel?
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.740]   When you first heard the warning?
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   When the first time you found the reality of judgment that's coming upon mankind?
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.780]   How that caused you to say, "I need to share the gospel."
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.620]   Remember the height from which you had fallen, and look at where you are, and he says to
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.780]   repent.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.100]   Why does he call them to repent?
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.580]   Why doesn't he just simply say, "Remember the height," and try to get back up there?
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   He says to repent, because it was a deliberate act.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.780]   We deliberately placed ourselves in a place where the truth of the Word of God would no
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.260]   longer shake our lives.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.540]   I'm willing to go to church.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.140]   I'm willing to maybe even tithe.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.940]   I'm willing to maybe even serve the church.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:07.060]   But if we're honest with ourselves, we're more fans than followers.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.220]   In Hebrews chapter 12, when he says to fix your eyes upon Jesus, it's not just a casual
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   look.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.320]   It's to turn your head and see where Jesus is and look.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:24.180]   The word means to gaze, to intently look, and don't take your eyes off of him.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.540]   You know, when I was visiting China a couple weeks ago, Pastor Alex had two scooters.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.620]   He had one that was more stronger and powerful, and then he had a smaller one that Vince used
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.620]   to ride.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.620]   And so, you know, he's the big guy, so he rode the big one, and then him and Flo, and
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.700]   those two knew their way around.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.180]   So we were supposed to go somewhere to take care of some business, and me and Andy, in
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.660]   this little putt-putt thing, we were riding behind him.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.300]   And typically when it's just me and Pastor Alex, we were able to just kind of go, you
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   know.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.780]   But this day, we had Andy behind me riding.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.780]   Was it Andy?
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.780]   Yeah, it was Andy, and then Flo was riding with him.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.780]   And she said, "Yeah, let's go."
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.060]   So he would take off, and usually I would just kind of putt-putt and then just follow
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.140]   him.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.180]   But this day was raining, so I think he wanted to hurry up and get out of the rain, and so
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.620]   he was just on his way, and he didn't look back, and he just took off.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.540]   Two blocks down, we lost him.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.540]   And Andy and I were, you know, we're in a new area, we're not in Wangjin, we're in
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.660]   Wudako, some of you guys who know that area.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.180]   And so it started raining, and we were like, "Where did this guy go?"
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.640]   So we were lost in the rain for about 40 minutes, and we got drenched, you know.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.320]   If you are casually just a fan of Jesus, you know, you can go to a stadium, kind of watch
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.300]   the game, and go to the bathroom, and get some food, and come back, and rejoin, and
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.900]   just kind of casually, you know.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:52.140]   If you're just a fan, you don't need to be sober all the time.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.920]   You can allow your heart to be callous a little bit, because the consequence isn't that great.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:05.540]   But if you are a follower of Jesus Christ, the moment we take our eyes off of Christ,
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.140]   we begin to drift.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.780]   I've never heard of anybody who just drifts towards Christ.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.680]   We all drift toward the world.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.320]   We all drift away from God.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.220]   And we drift toward callousness.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:29.660]   Why we are able to say that judgment is coming upon the world, in the church, and then yet
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.020]   never think about it while we're at work.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.060]   Because we learn to, "That's at church.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.100]   I'm at work."
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.980]   We allow ourselves to become callous.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   Because to live day to day with the reality of what the gospel teaches us, would shake
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.220]   our lives up to the point where we would be uncomfortable.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.860]   We will be uncomfortable the way we live.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.460]   We will be uncomfortable in the things that we pursue.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.860]   Therefore, we leave it at church.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.080]   If you look at, what is the heart of God?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.920]   If God is looking for people who is after His own heart, what is His heart?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.580]   It is absolutely crystal clear, Luke chapter 15, 1 through 32.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.100]   Jesus is hanging around with the sinners and the Pharisees say, "Why are you hanging around
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.100]   with the sinners?"
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.320]   And He gives three parables.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.180]   The first parable is a lost sheep, that He would leave the 99 to pursue the 1.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:35.580]   Meaning that God loves the sinner, that He would return.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.420]   He is pursuing them.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.500]   The second is a lost coin.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.420]   So He loses the one coin and He sweeps the whole house.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.480]   And in both instances, when they find a sheep, when they find a coin, they have a huge celebration.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.020]   Why was Jesus telling this story?
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.040]   Because He was rebuking the Pharisees.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.700]   You do not know the heart of God.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.720]   This is why the Bible was written.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.620]   This is why the church was established.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.100]   This is why we have discipleship.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.180]   This is why we have prayer meetings.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.860]   This is why we study the Bible.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.180]   This is why we have retreats.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.840]   This is why we send out people to China.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.760]   This is the heart of God.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.740]   And that is why He said, "You are the light of the world.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.100]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.500]   If you lose the saltiness, what good will it be?"
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.260]   The final, last one is the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.260]   And you know that story.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:41.220]   I'm not going to go into it, but the prodigal son, he hits rock bottom and he chooses to
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:47.180]   return and his heart is, "I'll go home and live like a servant.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.660]   And even my dad's servant lives better than what I'm experiencing here."
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.320]   So he chooses to go back home.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.700]   And this is how his reception is described in Luke chapter 15.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.900]   His father looks to the horizon and the picture that we see is a father who is there, who's
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.900]   been waiting.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.620]   The only reason why he's even given his son his inheritance was that it was probably the
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.220]   only way that he was going to win his son back.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.740]   And he is there waiting for his son.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.180]   And he finally sees his son in the horizon.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.220]   And he says he arose and came to his father.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:29.660]   But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion and ran
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.780]   and embraced him and kissed him.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:38.540]   And the whole reason for this parable is to reveal to the Pharisees that you do not know
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.300]   the heart of God.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.860]   It's because your heart has become so callous that even when the son of God is standing
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.740]   before you, you don't recognize him.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.740]   There's two instances in the scripture where Jesus' compassion was so deep and so strong
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.100]   that it welled up in him as weeping.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.740]   First instance, we mentioned in John chapter 11, 35, Jesus wept, the shortest passage in
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.260]   the whole Bible.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.340]   And this is in front of Lazarus' grave.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.300]   He deliberately takes his time to get to Lazarus' grave because he's waiting for Lazarus to
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.100]   die.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:23.460]   He comes and Mary is weeping and all the friends and family are gathered around the grave and
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.340]   weeping.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:30.460]   And Mary comes to Jesus and says, "Jesus, only if you had come a little bit sooner,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.500]   our brother would not have died."
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.580]   It's in that context Jesus is found to have been weeping.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.300]   A lot of people were kind of debating, like, "Why would Jesus weep?
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.020]   It doesn't make sense."
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.080]   Because Jesus deliberately waited.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.100]   If he did come earlier, if he didn't take his time, he would have been there and could
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.500]   have healed him.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.900]   So the fact that Jesus is there deliberately giving enough time for him to pass and then
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.780]   to weep because Lazarus is dead doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.580]   In fact, if you look at the word for weep in both instances where the crowd is weeping
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.260]   and Jesus is weeping, it's two different Greek words.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:16.500]   And I believe the meaning behind why he wept is more clarified in the second instance where
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   Jesus weeps, is in Luke chapter 1941, where Jesus is entering into Jerusalem on a donkey
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.860]   and there's a huge parade for him and everybody is expecting something spectacular to happen
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.820]   and it's a huge parade for Jesus.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:37.220]   Some say that there may have been more than a million people in Jerusalem at that time.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:43.580]   Doesn't mean that all of them were there receiving Jesus, but the crowd, the parade-like atmosphere,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:49.660]   and yet we find Jesus in verse 41 of Luke chapter 19, "When he drew near and saw the
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.460]   city, he wept over it."
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.940]   But here it describes why he was weeping.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:02.420]   He was weeping because he saw Jerusalem, because they completely missed him.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:09.240]   If you only knew today what would bring peace, destruction would not be coming.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.740]   And he was weeping over the judgment that was going to come upon his own people.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:20.140]   I believe the reason why he was weeping in Lazarus' grave is because death is the most
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.340]   tangible evidence of this judgment.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:29.140]   That he wasn't weeping because Lazarus physically died, because he was going to raise him physically.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.820]   But that's not why Jesus came.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:37.100]   He came because there is a bigger and deeper cancer in every human being.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.200]   And the only way to cure that is by the blood of Christ.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.260]   It was in the presence of the judgment of God.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:50.420]   It was in the tangible evidence of the judgment of God, where Jesus had the greatest compassion,
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.620]   and he wept over his people.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.500]   He wept over the sinners.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:05.960]   If we compartmentalize this truth, and we choose to hear it on Sunday, and block it
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:14.220]   off when we go to work in our homes, it not only causes us to be callous toward the things
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:19.100]   of God, it affects even our understanding of truth.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.180]   It affects our understanding of even being able to hear the voice of God.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.100]   My sheep, they hear my voice and they will follow me.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.380]   That is not just a mental exercise.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:35.740]   In Matthew 24 verse 12 it says, "Because of lawlessness will be increased, the love of
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.300]   many will grow cold."
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.780]   You guys know about the decision that was made this week at the Supreme Court.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.140]   And I know a lot of people were shocked, but if you've been paying attention, none of us
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.880]   should be shocked.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.320]   It was just a matter of time.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.060]   But what was shocking to me is not what the Supreme Court said, not what the world is
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.580]   saying, but what the church is saying.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.500]   The church is divided.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.780]   Fifteen years ago we would talk about this subject and there would be no rumbling in
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.780]   the church.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.660]   I would go to a Bible teaching church and mention something passing about homosexuality
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:20.260]   and I would get two, three people standing in line to talk to me about it.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:27.020]   He says, "Because of lawlessness, love of many will grow cold.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   For the last 10 to 15 years or longer, the church has been trying so hard to be relevant
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:41.380]   in our culture, by our music, by the way we preach, the way we dress, the way we present
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.740]   our church to the world.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.260]   And we've been trying so hard to become relevant to the world.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:54.580]   We may have become irrelevant to God."
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:33:01.460]   It says, "Because of increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold, but the one
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.060]   who endures to the end will be saved."
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:11.260]   When he talks about the one who endures, he says that love of many will grow cold, but
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.700]   the one who endures to the end.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.780]   So when he talks about enduring, what is he saying?
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.980]   The one who does not allow his heart to grow cold.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   That's what he's saying.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.420]   He's not simply talking about somebody who didn't physically leave the church.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.060]   He's not talking about somebody who's just doing the right thing, like the church of
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.500]   Ephesus.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:41.460]   He's talking about the love that has a tendency to grow cold when the world's wickedness increases,
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:48.420]   but the one who endures that, the one who endures and his love for Christ remains.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.940]   He says, "Shall be saved."
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.860]   And then it says, "And the gospel of this kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:02.380]   whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:07.060]   End will come when people who are passionate for Jesus proclaims the gospel to the remotest
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.540]   part of the world, he said, "Then he will come."
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.460]   The scripture is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.460]   Either you are with me or you are against me.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.780]   Either you are among the people who are helping me gather or you are among the people who
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.820]   are helping scatter.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.420]   The world has always rejected Christ.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.760]   The world will always reject Christ.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:37.660]   We should not be surprised by just how dark this world can become.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.700]   That's why we're here.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.060]   That's why we're light.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.780]   Jesus did not send us into the light to be a light.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.540]   He sent us as light into the darkness.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:57.020]   And if our hearts are callous, we wouldn't even recognize.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:05.620]   Again, you and I live in a culture where we're not allowed to think critically.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.660]   Everywhere we go, even while you're hiking, you have earplugs in your ear playing music.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.420]   You go to a coffee shop, got music blasted.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.980]   You get in your car, and if it's more than any five, six minutes, you have talk radio
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.900]   or music on.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.620]   You go home, TV is on.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.020]   Internet is on.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.660]   And we don't have time to sit down and think critically.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:32.640]   We're constantly being bombarded and told what to think, what to like, what to buy.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:40.620]   And as a result of that, we become callous to the things that really matter.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.060]   Do we believe the gospel?
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.700]   Not just as a security blanket.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.420]   Not just something that you check off so that when we die, that we can say, "Hey, I believe
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.620]   the gospel."
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:58.040]   Jesus did not come to make fans of Jesus.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.140]   As a fan of Jesus, we can say, "I like him.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.960]   I like what he says."
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.660]   Maybe even say, "I might love him," because who wouldn't?
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:13.340]   I mean, he is a man who gave himself to die for people who are undeserving.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:20.380]   I mean, what culture, what generation would not celebrate that kind of sacrifice?
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.840]   But Jesus did not come to make fans of himself.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.900]   He called people to follow.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.900]   And we cannot follow with callous hearts.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.660]   When was the last time you pleaded on the behalf of those who are under judgment?
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.520]   "Lord, send the workers."
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.540]   When was the last time you had compassion for somebody that you profess to believe is
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.940]   going to hell?
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.780]   When was the last time you made a decision to do something because you were moved with
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.100]   compassion?
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:05.580]   Have we allowed ourselves to be callous and be okay with it?
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:12.980]   Have you marginalized the voice of God because it's uncomfortable?
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:23.940]   I encourage us, I encourage all of us, never be okay with a hardened heart.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:31.380]   To come before the Lord and plead, first and foremost, "Lord, my heart has become hardened.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:37.720]   What I profess on Sunday and what I do during the weekday does not match, Lord.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.420]   It's not the same.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.940]   Lord, help me.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.500]   Help me."
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.900]   We're all desperately in need of revival.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.020]   Myself included.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:06.300]   If our heart's not broken for the lost, then we lie to ourselves.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.340]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:16.740]   And again, we can easily just file this away because after this we have to take care of
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.660]   our children.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.920]   We have to go eat.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.060]   We have to take care of our business.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.200]   But I pray with all my heart, today, tomorrow, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.620]   every day, that my faith would be real.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.700]   And that your faith would be real.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.780]   That we're not just building religious people.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:50.120]   But that what we profess and what we feel and what we do is consistent.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   Would you pray with me?
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:39:01.880]   As our praise team comes up, first and foremost, let's come before the Lord.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:07.080]   I know already that even in this room, already, that some of you are kind of like, "I've heard
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   this so many times."
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   And you're just going to click it off.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.800]   Go back to your normal life.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.480]   Now I'm not asking you to do this for me.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.120]   I'm not asking you to do this for anybody else.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:27.720]   But for yourself, are you here because you believe in Jesus?
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.080]   Are you a worshiper of God in spirit and in truth?
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.200]   Because God is not fooled.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.140]   He sees right through all of that.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.480]   And I'm in just as need as you are.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:47.200]   So let's come before the Lord in honest prayer and not build religiousness in our homes,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:55.600]   not build religiousness in our church, but to be genuine followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.040]   Would you take some time to pray with me as our worship team leads us?
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.620]   (upbeat music)
