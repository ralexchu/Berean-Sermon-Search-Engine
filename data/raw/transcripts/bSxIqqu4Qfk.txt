[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   Father, we thank you that you've gathered your church
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.300]   to come before you, to spend some extended time
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.300]   worshiping you and praying.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.300]   Lord, help us realize our own weaknesses.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   Lord God, we so often rely on ourselves
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.300]   and our own strength, but help us, Lord God, understand
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.300]   we are weak, but when we trust and rely on you,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   Lord God, we are strong.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   Lord God, may that be evident tonight as we pray
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   that we seek your face, that the things, Lord God,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   out of our control may be lifted up,
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   that the songs that we sing may be from our heart.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   From a desire, Lord God, to see your name magnified.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   Lord God, be with us to watch and pray.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   Lord God, help us, Lord God, to humble ourselves,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   to seek you, Lord God, to honor you, Lord God,
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.300]   through our lives, but we need you
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   and we need your spirit's power, Lord, to survive,
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   to walk through this life, Lord God.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.300]   I pray, Lord, that you remind us of that.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   Lord, that it may cause us, Lord God, to pray fervently,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   that we may come in repentance,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   we may come, Lord God, in reliance,
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   and that we come in reverence, Lord God.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.300]   So I pray, Lord God, that as we spend some more time
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   singing and worshiping you and an extended time praying,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   Lord, fill our minds with things, Lord God,
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.300]   that we see the need for prayer.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   Lord God, that praying may become easy, Lord God,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   because we've worked through it
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.300]   and we've labored through it.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.300]   So I pray for our church, Lord,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   that tonight may be a fruitful time,
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   it may be a blessing, and that we may walk away from here
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.300]   encouraged and challenged to pray even more.
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   So we entrust this time to you in Christ's name we pray.

[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   And let's all be seated.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:32.300]   - All right, hopefully if you came into the room,
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.300]   you should have a prayer sheet with you,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   and if you haven't, you probably need to get one, okay?
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   And we have, again, I should have plenty over there,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   and if you don't have one, we also do have a digital copy,
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   so if you go on our church app,
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   and they have that on there as well.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   I'm gonna give us plenty of time to pray corporately,
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   but I wanna give a short encouragement before we do that.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   You know, we've been studying through Thessalonians,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   2 Thessalonians chapter three, and we're almost at a close,
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   and I wanna read a passage that Apostle Paul,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.300]   as he is wrapping up in chapter three,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   and he says, "Finally, brethren," in verses one and two,
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   "pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   "and be glorified, just as it did also with you,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   "and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men,
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   "for not all have faith."
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.300]   When you study the Bible,
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   there are different periods of your life
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   where the word of God makes much more sense.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.300]   You can relate to it.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   So when you are wrestling or struggling with something,
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.300]   and you're reading a passage where there's a crying out to God
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   and desperateness, and you read that passage,
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   and there's a completely different take on that,
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   when not only do you understand it mentally,
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   but emotionally, you're exactly where they are, right?
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   And then many of you parents can relate
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   that you're talking about God's heart for us,
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   and you understand it in a different way
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.300]   when you have your own child
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   and the love that you have for your own kids
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   and the kind of emotions that's attached to that.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   So we're able to understand God's emotions better
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   because we're in that state.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   So in various different places in our life,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   the word of God makes much more sense,
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   and we have an attachment to it
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   that we may have just superficially had
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   and maybe even didn't know until we get to that point.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.300]   Well, New Testament, in fact, the whole Bible,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   but in particular the New Testament,
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   Apostle Paul's writing is written in the context
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.300]   of desperately seeking to save sinners.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   And so when we're studying the Bible,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.300]   and that's not our primary engagement in life,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:49.300]   it's almost impossible to study the Bible emotionally.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   You can study mentally and say,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.300]   "Well, this is what it's like.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   "Oh, this was what he must be like."
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   It's just like reading a book or watching a movie,
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.300]   and you can kind of relate in the sense
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   that I can imagine what that would be like.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   But only when you are actually engaged
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.300]   in the same things that Apostle Paul is engaged in,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   you can understand his desperateness
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   of why he would ask for prayer,
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   of all the things that he could ask for.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   As he is wrapping up this letter, concerned for them,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   he is struggling, he's being chased everywhere,
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   but the primary thing that's in his heart
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.300]   is that he says to pray for us
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   And he's not saying that this is a goal of my life.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.300]   He says rapidly.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   There's a sense of urgency to get the gospel out
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.300]   as fast as possible to as many people as possible,
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   and that he was going to live his life being burnt out.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   In fact, I think in Corinthians, when Apostle Paul says,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   "If I were you," again, not from the Lord, but from me,
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   "I would ask that you would be like me."
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   And I know a lot of people interpret that passage
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   as Apostle Paul saying to stay single
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   and maybe you have the gift of singleness.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   I have a different take on that passage.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   I don't think Apostle Paul is simply asking people to be single.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   I think what Apostle Paul was saying was to be like him
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   in the sense that he gave everything for Christ,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   that he was living his life day to day, going into villages,
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   being chased out, stoned, and being shipwrecked,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   and that if you were married, you wouldn't be able to do that
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.300]   because you would have to take care of your family.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.300]   So he wasn't simply calling certain people to singleness.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   He was calling certain people to singleness
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300]   so they could have an undivided attention.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.300]   In other words, Apostle Paul was not saying
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   that some of you may have been called to singleness,
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   some of you may have been called to be married.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.300]   What he is saying is that the Lord is not requiring this of you,
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.300]   but I'm asking you to join me, to stay single,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.300]   come with me and risk your life to get the gospel out
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   to as many people as possible, as rapidly as possible.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   And so I think in our prayer,
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   what we are always wrestling with is a sense of urgency.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   We pray, but it's not urgent until something becomes urgent.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   We get sick, we lose a job, something tragic happens in our life,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   and then our prayer life gets lit.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   But otherwise, we have a tendency to kind of casually approach God.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:17.300]   But this, when we understand soberly
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   the position that you and I are in,
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   that this really ought to be our own prayers.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   This is not just Apostle Paul happened to be a great man
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   and an apostle who did this.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   But every Christian should challenge ourselves
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.300]   that we would wrestle in this same manner.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.300]   I want to get the gospel out.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   Whether you are a full-time ministry,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.300]   whether you are a full-time homemaker,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   whatever position we are in life,
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   that our primary sense of urgency should be
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   to get the gospel to as many people as possible before we pass.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   And I don't think anybody can argue on paper
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   that that ought to be our greatest urgency.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   I mean, we have our life here,
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   and we're headed to heaven in the midst of all these people
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.300]   who are headed the wrong way, and judgment is coming.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   How can that not be our greatest concern?
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   How can that not be our greatest pursuit?
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   So he says, and if you notice, he says,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.300]   "Spread rapidly and be glorified,
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.300]   that the word of God may be glorified."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   He's not praying that he would find more techniques.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.300]   He's not praying that I would be able to do a better job.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.300]   He says that the word of God,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   that the word of God would spray rapidly
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   and that the word of God may be glorified.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   In other words, that it would bear fruit.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   More people would come to Christ, just as it did with them.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   And then we will be rescued from perverse and evil
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   if we not all have faith.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   He could have easily avoided this persecution
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   by not spreading the gospel urgently.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   Because of his sense of urgency to spread the gospel,
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   those people who didn't believe,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   those people who didn't glorify the word of God,
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.300]   those are the ones who are attacking him.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   So when he's asking for prayer for protection,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   he's not asking to avoid persecution,
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   because he's running into that.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   It's what he's doing that's causing the hatred toward him.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.300]   So he's not saying that protect us from this
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   so that we can avoid it.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   If we go there, there's going to be persecution.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.300]   If we go here, there's going to be trouble.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   He says, we're going to go.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.300]   We're going to go preach the gospel.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   And because we're going to preach the gospel,
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   there's going to be some men who don't believe
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.300]   who's going to attack us, that he would protect us
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   in the context of sharing the gospel.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   So why is this so important to us?
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   When we pray with that kind of urgency,
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   if our life is detached from how the apostles
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   and how the New Testament is written,
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.300]   we can study it as a textbook.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.300]   We can study it for knowledge.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   And it's interesting.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   Of course, we have some kind of connection to it.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.300]   But we don't really understand the emotional attachment,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   the sense of urgency, the desperateness that Apostle Paul had,
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.300]   that even in the midst of risking his life,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   calling other people to join him to spread the gospel.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   So this evening, we want to take some time to pray,
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   and to pray, again, with the sense of urgency.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   So if you look at the list, I'm going to just give you a chunk of time to pray.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   And again, I'm not asking you--
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   if you have desperate things that you need to pray for,
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   this is not a task that you need to finish tonight.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   But if you are wrestling with prayer,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   this is my suggestion that we pray corporately.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   First of all, pray as Apostle Paul asked
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   that the gospel would spread rapidly.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   And for whatever the reason, the longer that we are a Christian,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   the sense of urgency kind of dies down,
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   because we've done it for so long.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   So let's pray, right?
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   First of all, that we would have that sense of urgency.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   We're going to pray that the gospel would spread with urgency,
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   and we're going to pray that God would give us a sense of urgency.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   For whatever the reason that we've been entangled
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   and there is no sense of urgency to get the gospel out to as many people as possible,
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   that God would deal with our own hearts first.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   What is it that we're entangled with that's causing us to live day to day
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   as if this is our home, as if we're not leaving,
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   as if the people are not dying?
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   What is causing us to forget that on a day to day,
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   only to be reminded once a week or once every once in a while,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.300]   and then say, "Oh, shoot, that's right."
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   So let's come to the Lord and pray that we would live with sense of urgency.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   Two, B, pray for specific people.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   Don't pray generally for the world.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.300]   Pray specific people by name,
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   the lives that you desire to share the gospel with.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   Maybe you've been hesitating.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   Ask God for courage and boldness to be able to share the gospel with these people,
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   and to actually plan.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   And any time you say, "I want to do this,"
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   and you don't actually implement and put it on your calendar,
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   it usually ends with wishful thinking.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   And so after a while, you have a lot of things that you think you ought to do,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.300]   and then you have a sense of guilt that builds.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.300]   But to actually pray.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   There are specific people in mind that say,
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   "Oh, yeah, I mean, it'd be good. That person's in my life."
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.300]   But to actually plan to pray for them by name.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   Pray for the missionaries who've been displaced.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   Right now, there's many people who are on kind of standby.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   As you guys know, Pastor Alex and Harry and their family,
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   they're one of thousands of missionaries
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.300]   who are not in the field spreading the gospel right now.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   Pray for them, that God would use them to prepare them,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   so that when the doors do open up, Lord willing,
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   that they'd go in even with a greater sense of urgency.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   But along with that, that as they are waiting, that they're not just waiting.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   That the time that God has placed,
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   whether it's a month or a year or even longer than that,
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   that God would use them to spread the gospel
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   wherever they are displaced for the moment.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   So let's pray for them, specifically for the people that I've mentioned.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.300]   And then pray for our Indian pastors.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   I've been communicating back and forth with them.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   And some of you guys may know that the COVID situation in India
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   has become as worse as it can be.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   And so even the COVID vaccination centers are being shut down
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   because they think it's too dangerous to gather.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   So I've been talking to the pastors,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   and they're functioning like nothing's going on.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.300]   The laws are not being enforced in the village area,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   so they're doing ministry like normal.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   They're still going to the villages.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   It's not that they're not aware of what's going on with the COVID,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   but they are committed to spreading the gospel.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   So let's pray for protection.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.300]   The persecution there has been intensified.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   As much as the COVID situation was intensified,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   the persecution is just as intense.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.300]   So if you guys can keep that in your prayers as well.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   Those of you who have been with us to India, pray for specific villages.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   Pray for specific pastors, not just the leaders,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   but main leaders, but pray for those people that you remember,
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   if you can pray for them.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   Also, pray for the cafe event.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   I know this is not coming up until July.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   Our outreach team that's being led by our brother, June,
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   and that team is preparing to have a cafe night to gather them together
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   and to be able to share the gospel so that our church,
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   not only for the cafe night, but the preparation for that,
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   that we would be prayerful in reaching the lost, if you can pray for that.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   Pray for Searchlight Ministry or College Ministry that started this year
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   for the specific purpose of outreaching the campus, again, led by Pastor Nate.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.300]   And if you can pray for the college students,
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   that they would have, again, a sense of urgency on campus
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.300]   to spread the gospel to as many people as they can.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   Pray for the nonbelievers who are coming to our church.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.300]   I hope that you are aware that any given Sunday,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.300]   there are a handful of non-Christians who are in the church.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   And so it doesn't make sense for us to go to foreign lands to preach the gospel
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   if we're unaware and unwilling to do that when we're home.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   So we actually have quite a few people who are being brought by members of our church
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   who do not know the faith yet.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.300]   So let's pray for those people who are coming,
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.300]   that the gospel message would not just be heard from the pulpit,
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.300]   but even in the fellowship.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   As you're having conversations, if you meet somebody new,
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.300]   if you're in the habit of always just kind of clinging to two or three people that you know,
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   unaware that you may be surrounded by people who are in need of your encouragement
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.300]   or to even hear the gospel, that God would, again, change our mind, our attitude,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   and that we would be mindful of the non-Christians also who are coming to church.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.300]   And then if you can pray for our children.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.300]   We have--they're not official members yet.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.300]   They're members--they're children of the members of our church, most of them,
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   and obviously most of them are not Christian.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.300]   And so, again, that we would not have this attitude that they're kids.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.300]   We're just going to teach them Bible stories until they become college students,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   and then we'll get serious with them.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.300]   And I think that, again, that's a wrong attitude for us to have,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.300]   that they are non-Christians that need the gospel, and it's from a young age.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.300]   So let's pray for their salvation, right, not just so that they would like the church.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   Again, if we're not careful, little children who are raised in the church
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   are sometimes the hardest people to reach
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   because they've been around Sunday school and heard gospel messages
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   in a very nonchalant way without a sense of urgency,
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   and they become inoculated to the gospel.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.300]   So that's not what happens in our church, that pray for our Sunday school teachers
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   so that the Sunday school teachers would also have a sense of urgency,
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   spread the gospel to the children, and that they would, again, be rewarded for doing so.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.300]   So let's really pray for these things, right?
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   Don't just pray casually. Pray for the salvation not only of our own children,
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   but, again, the children in our church.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   Pray for the persecuted church. I'm not going to get into too much detail.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   I strongly encourage you, if you go to the International Mission Board, IMB website,
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   they have declared July--I think it was July or sometime in June--
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   the prayer--is it a day or a month--for persecuted churches.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   If you sign up for that, if you go to the imb.org, if you sign up for that,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   they will send you information about what's going on around the world
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.300]   and the numbers of people who are being persecuted, what country to pray for,
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.300]   how to pray for them.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   And so if you--I highly encourage you to do that
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   so that we can participate in praying for the persecuted church.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.300]   So I'm not going to get too into that, but as I've mentioned before,
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   the persecution in the church is increasing drastically.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.300]   Pray for wisdom in discerning what to fight for right now,
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   because the churches are being divided, and that we would not divide over our opinions.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.300]   No matter how strong our opinions are, that we would not divide over our opinions.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   But at the same time, that God would give courage to the church leadership,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   not only us but in other churches, to divide when it is necessary.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   Unity at all costs is not unity.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.300]   And again, right now, we need true discernment
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   because the church is drifting so far away from the true message of the gospel.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   There is a temptation to either overly be aggressive in dividing lines
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.300]   or sweep everything under the table where everything is good.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   And so we need wisdom. We need wisdom to know not to divide over opinions,
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   but again, to have courage when it is time that we would not fear man but God.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   So if you can pray for that, pray for the families of the Indian pastors,
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.300]   not only for the evangelists, but the families that are supporting them as well,
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   if you can keep them in your prayers.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   Pray also for the leaders of our country.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.300]   And as you guys know, the politics has become as ugly as I can ever remember
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   that God would cause them to fear God.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.300]   Many of them, even if they're not Christians, profess to know God,
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   but that there would be a fear of God in their lives that would cause them
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.300]   to have God-fearing policies.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   Pray for the Christians who are in the government,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.300]   that they would have boldness to be able to share the gospel with other leaders.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.300]   And so let's take some time to pray for that.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   Pray also for the upcoming events at our church, your cafe outreach I mentioned already,
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.300]   24/5 for the young couples in our church, college fellowship,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.300]   brian seeds opening, that's this Sunday,
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.300]   film-o-ship that's happening. It's not May 8th, I think it's May 22nd.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   And we're going to give a brief announcement at the end of our prayer time for that,
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   if you can pray for that. Pray for our small groups, small group leaders,
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   home group leaders, as we are wrapping up our study,
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   that again, not only for them but for our whole church,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   that our inductive Bible study is not just, well, our church is doing it
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.300]   so we're just checking it off. The reason why we're doing inductive Bible study this way
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   is to encourage and challenge our church that we would do this even when we're not doing Bible study,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   that this would become a habit, a daily habit.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   And so that hopefully at some point that Bible study is happening in your life
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   and every time you get together with other Christians, you would naturally have something to share.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   Not only because you've been given an assignment, but that's become a habit in our life.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   So if you can pray for that as well, for your life and for the culture of the church.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   And then pray for the summer retreat that's coming up.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   There's a lot of logistical things that we need to work on because of the COVID situation.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   We don't know where we're going to be. We are going to have it.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   The hotel is allowing us to come and we need to do everything we can.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   And I know that there are some people in the church still nervous about that.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   And we're praying that by August, that all of us, no matter what the situation,
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   we can't hunker down forever. And so we're going to challenge the church.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   We're going to encourage you to do your best to sign up for that and come out to that retreat
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:57.300]   and really try to get back on our feet and with full force, not just from a distance,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.300]   but together that we would utilize everything God has given us.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   And with the environment that God has created because of COVID,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   more and more people are willing to talk about faith and beyond this life.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   And so it's a great opportunity for our church to kind of regroup and then to go out together.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.300]   And I hope that this retreat will serve for that purpose.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   So if you guys can keep that in your prayer as well.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   Okay, so before I send you off and I'm going to give you about 35 minutes to pray.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   But before I do that, I'm going to give you a three, five minutes to turn around.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   You don't have to go far. Right. And you can keep your distance.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   If you can get the prayer request of about three people around you and then put it on the back sheet.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.300]   Okay. And then after you've done that, I'm just going to five minutes go by.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   So, you know, this is not share your deepest longings. Right.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   This is like whatever is urgent you're praying for. Pray for that.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.300]   And you're not going to have time to pray together. You're just going to share.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:03.300]   Jot it down. And then when you go off to pray on your own, you'll pray for that along with these prayer requests.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.300]   Okay, so I'll give you five minutes. Just turn around. Don't move around.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   Just kind of turn your head. Whoever is around you in five minutes.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   But I tap the table. We'll begin our prayer.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   [Praying]

[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:56.100]   Okay.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.300]   We should be wrapping up.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:03.140]   If you're done, if you can turn your heads toward this direction for a minute before
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.580]   we get started.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.700]   Okay.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.820]   Okay.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:17.460]   Alright, before I let you go and take the next 35 minutes, which means 8 to 8.50, and
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.740]   then we're going to be, we're going to wrap up things around 9 o'clock.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.980]   Just want to give you an encouragement of prayer, right?
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:31.100]   And just like we did last time we talked about it, prayer is a muscle that you have to exercise.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.820]   That if you're in a habit of as soon as your mind starts wandering and you give into that,
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.460]   that's going to be a pattern continuously, right?
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.460]   It's like, "Oh, I can't concentrate," or "I start to keep thinking about some movie that
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.340]   I watch," or "I have some urgent things that I need to take care of," and you just kind
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.700]   of let your mind wander, right?
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.820]   You give in and you just kind of let it go, and that's kind of like the habit that you're
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.060]   going to build, and so you can't pray, right?
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.820]   So prayer is something that you have to be in a habit, just like starting the Bible.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.580]   If you only study the Bible when you open it up and God speaks to you from the first
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.820]   line, right, you're not going to get your insight.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.880]   That's why we do inductive Bible study, we take time.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.820]   Sometimes you may be sitting there 15 minutes and you don't get any insight, and after 20,
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.900]   30 minutes of wrestling with this text, you start to see things, and all of a sudden once
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.420]   you see it, things begin to click, right?
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.220]   But that doesn't happen the moment you open up the Bible.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:27.060]   It's because you've wrestled, you put your time in it, and prayer is no different.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.260]   There are some days when you're able to pray, something's going on in your life, and you
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:35.340]   can just jump into prayer right away, and then a lot of times, prayer requires a commitment,
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.180]   a discipline, that you choose to pray, right?
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.020]   And you choose to pray over these things, and so you can just—that's why I've given
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.460]   you this, so that this can help you and guide you when you're wrestling and your mind wanders
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.700]   so you can read this and pray along this line.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:56.460]   But again, I want to encourage you for the next 35 minutes to learn to wrestle in prayer,
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.100]   even if you felt like for the next 35 minutes, every two seconds, something else comes into
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.060]   your mind, but you were fighting that.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:09.540]   That ability to fight through that is also an important thing, even if you felt like
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.380]   that's all you did, that wrestling was necessary.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.580]   And each time you do that, hopefully it gets better, right?
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.820]   So I want to, again, give you guys the opportunity to kind of spread out if you want, stay where
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.540]   you are, you can get on the floor if you want, but for the next 35 minutes, we'll pray, and
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.860]   then when we're about a minute or so away from wrapping it up, I'll just tap the table,
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.860]   and you'll know, okay?
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:42.020]   All right, let me pray for us, and then we'll release you to take some time to pray.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.860]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for our brothers and sisters.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:53.100]   Lord, that we may run this race together, that whether we are strong in our faith or
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:57.140]   whether we've been drifting, whether we've been Christians for many years, or whether
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:05.260]   we've just become aware of Lord God, of your presence, help us, Lord, to pray.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:10.620]   Though we are weak, we know, Father God, and we believe how important this is.
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:16.180]   The example that you've set, the example that Christ set, the clear commands of Scripture,
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:22.620]   and even our own past experiences, Lord God, of answered prayers, Lord, that we remember.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:28.420]   I pray that you would give us a sense of urgency, that we would not simply coast along in this
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.900]   life.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.300]   Help us, Lord God, not only for us, but even for the next generation, that we would build
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.940]   a church that is grounded upon your word, that is desperate, Lord God, for your blessing
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.740]   and for your grace.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.260]   And so we pray this evening that you would help us to pray.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.020]   Help us, Lord God, that our mind would not wander.
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.060]   Help us to wrestle.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.780]   Help us to persevere.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:55.280]   And help us, Lord God, to cry out to you, asking you to answer our prayers, Lord God,
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:01.540]   and to recognize, Lord, that we are just wanderers, soldier-in-resistance, just passing by, that
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.020]   we would not be entangled with this world.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.420]   So I pray for each one of my brothers and sisters here that you would help us, help
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:13.500]   us to struggle, help us, Lord, to stay sober and alert, that I know some of our brothers
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:18.220]   and sisters are fatigued after a long day at work, but that even more so, Father God,
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.920]   that you would teach us to pray.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.020]   So we ask for your anointing and your blessing in this time.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.020]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.020]   Okay.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.020]   All right, let's pray.

[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:22.020]   She's going to give a brief announcement about the film-morship that's happening.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.620]   And then I'll pray for us to wrap up the meeting and then we'll have our final song.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.020]   Our final song and then I'll pray.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.020]   Okay?
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:36.020]   >> Grace.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.020]   >> Okay.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.020]   Hi, everyone.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.020]   My name is Grace.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:42.620]   Two Sundays ago I went ahead and shared that we were going to have a women's fellowship,
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:43.620]   a sister's fellowship.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.620]   And it's not going to be May 8th.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.020]   That's actually the last date to sign up.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.620]   So that's one week from tomorrow.
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.620]   So we're really trying to push this event out.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.620]   May 22nd is the date that you want to keep in mind.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:57.620]   There's no slide here, but it's essentially a film fellowship.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.620]   We're going to get together and have a time of -- so sorry.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.620]   Got kind of nervous for a second.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.620]   I'm kind of looking at faces and it's a little dark.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.620]   But it's a really, really awesome event.
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:13.620]   For those of you who are new to this church or have never attended one of these events,
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   it's a great way to meet other sisters.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   This is going to be from high school and up.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:22.620]   And it's going to be May 22nd, 830 to 1230.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.620]   This is for the ladies, but I was just thinking for the gentlemen, whether it's your wives,
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:32.620]   your girlfriends, future girlfriends, sisters in Christ, invite them.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.620]   Push them to come and be in prayer at the time, too.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.620]   I would say for the husbands, be supportive.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.620]   Watch the kids.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:41.620]   It means a lot.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:45.620]   But anyway, so if you have any questions, we do have -- the e-mail should have been pushed out.
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.620]   You can talk to Carrie Chang about it.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.620]   And it's also on social media as well through Facebook.
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.620]   If you have any questions, just let me know.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.620]   But it's going to be pretty wonderful.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:59.620]   It's the first women's event since the lockdown, so we're excited.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.620]   There is a virtual option, but we really want to push for this in person.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.620]   It makes so much of a difference.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.620]   Her name is Darlene Dibler-Rose.
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.620]   If you'd like to look her up just before you come, she is a missionary from Papua New Guinea,
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.620]   and she's phenomenal.
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.620]   You won't forget.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   Thanks so much.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.620]   [Applause]
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.620]   Church family, let's all rise together.

[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:36.620]   What can wash away our sins?
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:43.620]   What can make us whole again?
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:55.620]   Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:00.620]   Your blood speaks a better word
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:06.620]   than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:14.620]   Your blood speaks righteousness for me, stands in my defense.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:22.620]   Jesus, it's your blood.
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:28.620]   What can wash away our sins?
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:35.620]   What can make us whole again?
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:47.620]   Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:54.620]   What can wash us pure as snow?
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:29:00.620]   Welcome, dance the friends of God.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:10.620]   Nothing but your blood, nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:19.620]   [Music]
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:23.620]   Your cross testifies in grace,
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:30.620]   tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.620]   How boldly we approach,
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.620]   not earthly confidence,
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:44.620]   it's only by your blood.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:51.620]   What can wash away our sins?
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:57.620]   What can make us whole again?
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:10.620]   Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:16.620]   What can wash us pure as snow?
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:22.620]   Welcome, dance the friends of God.
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:32.620]   Nothing but your blood, nothing but your blood, King Jesus.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:35.620]   [Music]
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:42.620]   What can wash away our sins?
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:48.620]   What can make us whole again?
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:31:00.620]   Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.620]   Okay, so before I pray, I want to again encourage you and remind you that on Sundays,
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:09.620]   we left 15 minutes before the service so that we can have corporate prayer.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:15.620]   And so we encourage you to come out 15 minutes and just spend some time in your person of prayer,
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.620]   preparing for worship, praying for the needs of the church.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:23.620]   And if you happen to be in the room or in that time for doing whatever you're doing,
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.620]   please try to respect the time that we have so that we can pray.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:33.620]   But again, we want to encourage you to at least mentally have it in mind that our worship starts 15 minutes earlier
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.620]   so that that can be a habit that we have.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.620]   Okay, so let me pray for us.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:46.620]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for our church, the fellowship that we have with one another.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:51.620]   I pray that each time we gather together, that iron sharpening iron,
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:58.620]   that we may be sharpened toward you in times of discouragement and in times of rejoicing,
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:04.620]   that we truly would be a church, Lord God, that we are, we'll be better than when we are alone.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:11.620]   And so help us, Lord God, to be a church dedicated to prayer, that even though we are weak,
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:15.620]   that this is something that we can grow and to be strengthened in each month, each year.
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:21.620]   And just asking, Lord God, that not only your word, but much more in prayer, Father God,
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:24.620]   so that all that we do would honor and glorify you.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   So we thank you, Lord God, that believing in our hearts, Lord, that you have heard us,
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:35.620]   and that when you do answer the prayers that we've offered, help us, Lord God, to be sober,
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:41.620]   to know that it is you being gracious to us, that we may rejoice and worship you and thank you as well.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   So we bless your name, Father, for all that you are and all that you've done.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:49.620]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.620]   Turn the lights on.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.620]   I do have a quick announcement. Okay, quick announcement.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   Our sister, Susan Fong-Rae, was able to secure our extra parking,
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.620]   not right behind us, but behind our new building.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.620]   So there's a building behind that.
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:12.620]   So if you park on the wrong side, you might get towed.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:16.620]   So make sure you know what you're doing.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:21.620]   That building and right behind that, there's about 60 or 70 parking spots there.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   So if you happen to come late, which you shouldn't, but if you did, check that parking lot,
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:30.620]   and then there is a path that you can cross across.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   There's a gate, and so it's actually a pretty close parking lot.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.620]   So starting from this Sunday, it will be open.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:42.620]   So if you happen to want to check that out, and if you don't know how to get there, ask somebody.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:48.620]   So it'll start opening this Sunday.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:54.620]   [ Silence ]
