[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:45.700]   - Morning. Welcome to Parin Community Church. I just have a few announcements before we
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:54.560]   get started. First of all, those of you who've been supporting our Indian pastors, we have
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   an annual commitment, so that annual commitment is being finished at the end of May. And so,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.200]   we're asking you to recommit to that. And those of you who are not involved with that,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.160]   we encourage you to try to think about that. We've been giving updates on our Parin members
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.880]   page about what's going on in India. But as you guys know, our pastors have been actively
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.060]   working in India, despite all the stuff that's been going through. And I think the last update
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.920]   I gave you, that our pastors were heavily persecuted and beaten, the two pastors that
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.680]   we've been working with. And so, when I was talking to them, they were still at the hospital,
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.480]   and I think they're out now. But again, as soon as they come out, they're telling me
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.640]   that they have plans to go to the next village. And I've shared this before, but part of the
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.200]   reason why we got involved in India is because the heaviest concentration of unreached people
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.000]   groups are in India. The heaviest concentration of illiteracy is in India. The heaviest concentration
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.040]   of poverty is also in India. And so, even though it's a nation that's really growing
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.200]   fast economically, especially for the people in the village and for Christians, the persecution
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.040]   meter is rising heavily. So, even just during the time that we've been involved in India,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.840]   they were ranked number 26 or 27 in persecution, and they have risen just in the last six,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   seven years to number 10 or number nine, you know, and just right below the Middle Eastern
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.160]   countries. And so, despite that, they're actively working, getting the gospel in, and
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   they're starting brand new churches. And so, the finances that we are supporting them with
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.400]   is going to very, very good use. I am going to be heading out in June to visit our pastors,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.080]   and just to kind of scope to see that maybe we can pick up our work again in January.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   And so, if things check out, we may do that, and I'll let you know at the end of summer
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.760]   if that is possible. But for now, the support that we are giving, again, if you committed
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   for the year, it's coming to an end at the end of May, and then starting from June, we're
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.480]   going to have new sign-ups. So, if you desire to sign up for that, our actual physical sign-up
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.160]   for that is going to start next week. And so, I'm just giving you a heads up to take
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.480]   some time to pray about it, and then it's about $50 a month for each pastor's family.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.740]   There's about 60 pastors now that, pastors' families that we're supporting. And so, please
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.880]   consider signing up for that for the next year. And then I'll give you a reminder next
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.120]   Sunday. We'll probably even have something set up so you guys can go out and then give
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.240]   your sign-ups for that. Other than that, I'm just going to leave the rest of the announcement
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.360]   for you to check on the website or the app. I'm going to pray for our offering, and then
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.720]   after that, after our main worship time, our brother John Chin is going to come up, and
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.520]   he's going to give his testimony. He'll be baptized this morning. Those of you who are
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.640]   new to the church, we have a physical offering in the back. If you brought a physical check
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.680]   after the service, you can go and visit right underneath that clock, and then just drop
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:02.220]   it off there. Okay? Let me pray for us. Gracious Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.100]   We pray that you would continue to guide and lead us, that wherever our hearts and our
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.740]   mind may have been this week, I pray again that you would help us to lift our eyes to
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:22.760]   know that Christ and Christ alone is our true hope. Lord, as we live upon this earth, help
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.220]   us, Lord God, to walk by faith and not by sight. Even this offering that we give, we
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.020]   pray that you would bless it 30, 60, 100-fold. May it be used for your glory and your kingdom.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.020]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   - Hi, church family.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   My name is John Chin.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   I'm a grad student, and it's a privilege
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   to share my testimony with you today.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   I grew up in a Christian household.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   I called myself a Christian and attended church,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   but did not have a relationship with God.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   I understand the gospel or read the Bible.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   I wanted to get good grades, get into a good college,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   and be successful by the world's standards.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   In my junior year of high school, I worked too hard,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   experienced burnout, and had to drop my classes.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   Throughout my struggle, I did not really think of God
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   or turn to him.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   I was just trying to make sense
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   of what was going on and stabilize.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   I transferred schools, repeated my junior year,
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   and did well at the new school.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   I was extremely thankful to God for healing me
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   and helping me to recover.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   However, my relationship with God was based primarily
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   on experience rather than belief in the gospel.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   My real growth in the knowledge of the gospel
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.120]   started in college.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.120]   I started focusing on Christ.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   I attended worship services, Bible studies,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   and served in various capacities.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   However, I didn't read the Bible consistently.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   I absorbed lots of teaching about the Bible
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   and grew closer to God,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   but I still desired the things of this world--
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   success, wealth, comfort.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.120]   I don't recall a specific moment when I received Christ,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.120]   but I'll share what I came to believe.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   I believe in the gospel, that there is a God,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   and he is holy, righteous, and good,
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.120]   that all mankind have sinned,
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   fall short of God's perfect standard,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   and deserve eternal condemnation.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   But God, in love and mercy,
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   sent his son Jesus Christ for us.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   Jesus lived a perfect life, died for our sins,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   and rose from the dead to prove that he was the son of God.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   Jesus took the sin that was ours,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   and in faith we receive his righteousness.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   And so our response should be to turn away from sin
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   and turn towards Christ.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   Next, I'll share when I was convicted of my sin
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   and requested forgiveness.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   I struggle with lust, and recently I had another relapse.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.120]   I felt guilty for sinning and frustrated
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   that the struggle with lust is so hard.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   I also felt separated from God.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.120]   In that moment, and others like it,
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   I was convicted of how deep my sin is.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   I am a sinner to the core,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   in need of God's love, grace, and mercy.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   Afterwards, I prayed to God and asked for forgiveness.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.120]   I asked God to help me repent,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   turn away from sin, and turn towards him.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   I remembered that Christ died for my sins,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   and that by his blood I am forgiven.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   I still struggle with lust,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   but rather than living in sin, I seek to struggle with sin.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   Since I came to Berean,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   I have continued to grow closer to Christ.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.120]   I learned how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.120]   which has been helpful in reading the word on my own.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   I have had fruitful times reading the word
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   where I have been challenged and encouraged.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   I noticed interesting observations
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   and came up with questions that I kept in the back of my mind.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   One of those questions is what it means to fear the Lord,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   and although I have a better understanding of that now,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   I look forward to learning more.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   I still desire the things of this world,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   but the more I love Christ,
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   the less I care about worldly things.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   In closing, I am grateful for how God has worked in my life,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   and I seek to run the race faithfully and with endurance.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   Thank you.

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.460]   of the Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.720]   and her name was Elizabeth.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.100]   They were both righteous in the sight of God,
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.320]   walking blamelessly in all the commandments
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.560]   and requirements of the Lord.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.660]   But they had no child because Elizabeth was barren,
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.480]   and they were both advanced in years.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.400]   Now, it happened that while he was performing his priestly
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.360]   service before God in the appointed order
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.660]   of his division, according to the custom
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.160]   of the priestly office, he was chosen by law to enter the
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.960]   temple of the Lord and burn incense.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.200]   And a whole multitude of the people were in prayer outside
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.440]   at the hour of the incense offering.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.040]   Let's pray.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.280]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.440]   We pray, Father God, that your word would really speak to us,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.820]   allow us to hear your voice, Lord God,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.400]   and not just words of men.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.300]   Help us, Lord, to be illuminated,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.500]   to not only know your thoughts, but your own heart.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.940]   We pray that we would get a glimpse of who you are,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.820]   that we may learn to love you, to honor you,
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.220]   to obey you in all things.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.160]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.760]   Amen.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:55.120]   >> You know, oftentimes when various things happen
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   in our life, we don't have a complete answer as to why is
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.820]   this happening, because we're not able to see the big picture.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.940]   We don't see the past.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.060]   We don't see how -- what this is going to lead to.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.180]   So we oftentimes, you know, just trust that God is sovereign.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.340]   We don't know where this is going.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:17.200]   And typically we will read verses like Romans 828 says,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.020]   that we know that God causes all things to work together
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.480]   for good to those who love God,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.320]   to those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.700]   And so we use that verse to encourage one another,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.660]   to encourage ourselves, to remind us that God is sovereign.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.040]   But oftentimes we don't know exactly where this is headed.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.220]   And so when we look at redemptive history,
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.120]   we're able to see the fruition of these passages.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.320]   Like what does he mean by this?
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.920]   What has God been doing behind this scene?
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.400]   Galatians 4.4 says, "But when the fullness
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.260]   of time came, God sent forth his son.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.620]   Born of a woman, born under the law,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.300]   God waited for the perfect time."
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.780]   What made it the perfect time?
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.780]   And I remember thinking early on,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.660]   and you hear maybe other people saying,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.360]   it made a perfect time because the Romans, you know,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.740]   they came into power and they created all these roads.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.280]   So that if you were going to go evangelize to the remotest part
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.840]   of the world, that would have been the perfect time,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.280]   because all the roads have been created
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.580]   so that they can pretty much get anywhere they needed to go.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.280]   Or it was a perfect time because the language was united.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.860]   The Greeks did such a great job of bringing people together,
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.740]   all of a sudden they were able to communicate.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.720]   They had the local language, and then they had Greek language.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.500]   And so because of that, now they were able
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.820]   to communicate with one another.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.320]   Politically, Romans conquered so much of the land
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.740]   that they were able to move from place to place
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.780]   and didn't have much problem.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.760]   Now, all of these things may be true, but none
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.140]   of that is mentioned in the Bible.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.920]   Those are just speculations that, yes, it was an ideal time.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.740]   But what the Bible does mention is that God waited
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.320]   until the law exposed sin to be utterly sinful.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.480]   He allowed sin to have its full effect.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.160]   In fact, when you study the book of Romans, Romans begins
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.760]   by telling us this very thing.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.400]   And if you've studied the book of Romans,
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.020]   if you were with us a while back,
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.320]   and Romans chapter 1 was a long time ago.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.260]   But if you look at Romans chapter 1, it's clear
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.020]   that the reference that he's making
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.580]   to specifically is to the nation of Israel.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.120]   Even though it has ramification to all the nations,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.920]   he specifically says the nation of Israel,
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.580]   for even though they knew God, they did not honor him
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.180]   as God or give thanks.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.740]   But they became futile in their speculations
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.060]   and their foolish heart was darkened,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   professing to be wise, they became fools,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.260]   and exchanged the glory of God for the incorruptible God,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.200]   glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.460]   of corruptible man and of birds and of four-footed animals
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.420]   and crawling creatures.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.180]   Now, again, this can be applied to all mankind,
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.260]   but specifically it's in reference
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.460]   to how God has given them the law.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.860]   He showed his glory.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.960]   He performed miracles.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.860]   And yet, though God made it very clear to them who he is,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.160]   showed them the glory, they chose to continue
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.360]   to chase after idols.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   And this basically is Israel's history.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.260]   So it says in verse 4 all the way down to verse 28,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.760]   three separate times he mentions,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.160]   "Therefore God gave them over," verse 24,
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.360]   "Therefore God gave them over in the lust of their hearts
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.860]   to impurity so that their bodies would be dishonored among them
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.460]   for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, worshipped
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.960]   and served the creatures rather than the creator
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   who is blessed forever.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.760]   Amen."
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.860]   And then again in verse 26,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.360]   "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.260]   For their women exchanged the natural function for that
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.260]   which is unnatural.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.160]   And in the same way also the man abandoned natural function
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.660]   of the women and burned in their desire toward one another,
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.060]   men with men committing indecent acts and receiving
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:02.160]   in their own persons the due penalty of their error."
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.860]   Again in verse 28,
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.160]   "And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer,
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   God gave them over to depraved minds to do those things
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.860]   which are not proper."
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.260]   So three separate times in chapter 1,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.760]   he says wrath of God is being revealed.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   And even though he made who he is through natural revelation,
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.360]   specifically to the Jews,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.660]   through special revelation through the law,
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.960]   and yet they continue to chase after idols, reject him.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.760]   And he says God gave them over, God gave them over,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.660]   God gave them over.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:39.960]   So Israel's history is a repeating cycle of a rebellion against God
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.660]   and as a result of that falling into sin
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.460]   and then God allowing this sin to bear the fruit
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.560]   that it's supposed to bear.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.160]   The reason why I say all of this is
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.260]   because Luke breaks into this darkness.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.960]   And so it's important for us to first recognize
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.860]   why what made this the fullness of time?
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.160]   Why at this time was Jesus coming?
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   Why couldn't he have come 400 years before?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.960]   Why didn't he come 400 years later?
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.260]   It's almost as if God was waiting for whatever it is
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.860]   that they were chasing after to have its full effect.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.460]   So that when Christ comes and he turns the light on,
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.060]   the people who are in darkness would recognize immediately
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.260]   that must be Christ.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.860]   There's three people that are mentioned here
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.460]   that I'm going to go over that on the surface kind of seems random.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.460]   Right?
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.260]   Because Luke started by saying
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.160]   that he's going to make an orderly account,
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   a careful account.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.460]   He's going to interview eyewitnesses
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.260]   and he's going to present it probably in a chronological manner,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.460]   at least to the best of his ability
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.860]   and to present to Theophilus
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   so that he may be convicted about things
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.660]   that he's already heard of.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.660]   Right?
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.460]   So typically in other Gospels,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.460]   they'll either start right off with Jesus
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.660]   or they'll jump into John the Baptist shows up
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.860]   and he does ministry and he gets baptized
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.960]   and boom, they go into ministry.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.460]   Here, he spends quite a bit of time in chapter 1
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.860]   of something that seems almost insignificant.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.460]   Right?
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.260]   At least on the surface.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.860]   Initially, he starts by saying
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.560]   Herod the Idrimian was the king of that time.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.060]   Now superficially,
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.860]   that's how they dated things at that time.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.060]   Right?
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.460]   Today, if we want to keep a record of something,
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.460]   we would say on this particular day,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.660]   on 9/11/2001, this happened.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.160]   Right?
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.460]   And we know exactly when that happened.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   Well, at that particular time,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.660]   in order to date something,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.260]   they would date it based on who was the king at the time.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.260]   This is the third year of king so-and-so
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.660]   or the fourth year or the beginning year of this
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.760]   and that's how they knew exactly when this happened.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   But in the Gospels,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.260]   it has greater significance
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.760]   than just dating when this happens.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.460]   Because if you look at Israel's history,
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.260]   it's filled with God pleading with the nation of Israel
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.860]   to turn from their sin
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.260]   and warning them that if they do not,
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.460]   a foreign nation is going to come
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.860]   and dominate over them.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.960]   He warns prophet after prophet after prophet
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.660]   that if you do not turn from your sin,
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.160]   that the Assyrians are coming,
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.960]   that the Babylonians are coming,
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.260]   that they will come and take away your strongmen,
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.660]   your wives, your children,
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.160]   and you will no longer be a nation.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.960]   Well, that's exactly what happens.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.760]   The Assyrians come in 900 BC
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.560]   and they take the northern kingdom to captivity.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.660]   All ten of the tribes are taken into captivity,
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.460]   never to be restored again.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.060]   In 587 BC, the Babylonians come
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.160]   and they take the southern kingdom,
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.360]   Judah and the Benjamites,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.260]   and then they go into captivity.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.160]   And so for over 900 years,
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.960]   Israel's history is one oppression
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.060]   from a foreign nation,
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.860]   from a pagan nation, after another.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.760]   The Assyrians come in,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.760]   the Babylonians come in,
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.660]   after that the Persians come in.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.160]   During the Persian era,
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.060]   God raises up a pagan king, King Cyrus,
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.960]   and softens his heart
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   and he allows the nation of Israel
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.560]   to return back to their land
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.260]   to rebuild their temple.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.960]   But by that time, Israelite have forgotten
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.160]   and have been moved so far away from God
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.060]   that even though they had every support
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060]   that they needed to go back
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.960]   and rebuild the nation,
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   only a very small remnant returned,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.160]   drop in a bucket,
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.960]   which means majority of them
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.160]   have already forgotten about the covenant.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.660]   Whatever promises that God made,
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.760]   they've already forgotten about it
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.560]   because their life has already become so easy
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.460]   in Babylon.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.260]   They've integrated into Persia.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.660]   It's in the middle of this
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.760]   that Malachi is sent as a prophet
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.360]   and he's the last prophet.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   And after him, there's 400 years
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.960]   where God no longer sends a prophet.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.060]   Malachi 3.1 says,
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.860]   "Behold, I am going to send my messenger
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.260]   and he will clear the way before me.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.560]   And the Lord whom you seek
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.360]   will suddenly come to his temple
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.560]   and the messenger of the covenant
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.360]   in whom you delight.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.560]   Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts."
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.260]   So the last prophet,
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.760]   the last thing that he says is
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.160]   that once all this period
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.260]   that God has ordained because of your sin,
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.460]   after that period is done,
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.160]   he will come.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.960]   The messenger is going to come.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.460]   John the Baptist is going to come
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.060]   and he's going to prepare for the Messiah to come.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.660]   And that's the last prophecy
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.060]   that was given to the nation of Israel.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.760]   And then there's 400 years of silence.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   No prophet is sent.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.260]   Now, for 400 years,
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.860]   even though there was no prophet,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.260]   it doesn't mean that there was nothing going on.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.060]   After that, the Greeks take over
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.760]   and they Hellenized everybody.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.360]   If the Babylonians and the Persians
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.860]   made it easy to integrate into the pagan nation,
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.460]   the Greeks made it much easier.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.860]   I mean, they even given them a name
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.860]   for some people who were Hellenized.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.760]   Meaning they integrated so well
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.660]   that they began to lose their culture
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.460]   and even their language.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.860]   They said they were Hellenized Jews.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.060]   They were Jew by heritage,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   but in everything else, they were Greeks.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.660]   That's how good of a job that the Greeks did.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.860]   And more and more people start to drift away
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.060]   from who God is.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.160]   And then after the Greeks leave,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.060]   they have turmoil during that period.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.560]   There's some hope during the
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.760]   Hasmonean rebellion,
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.960]   but that is almost immediately crushed.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.060]   And then the Romans come in
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.660]   and they completely dominate.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.160]   Romans conquered so much of that modern nation
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.260]   that they had to put puppet figures all over.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.360]   You know, kind of like what's going on
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.860]   with Russia and Ukraine right now.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.360]   The Russia came into Ukraine
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.860]   because they want to set up a puppet president
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.360]   that they can control.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.460]   So they can make sure that
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.560]   that area is going to benefit them.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.460]   Well, that's exactly what happened with Israel.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.360]   So King Herod of this time was a puppet king
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.560]   whose main job was to suppress rebellion
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   from the Jews and to appease the Romans.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.860]   So who he was on the surface
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.060]   is pretty obvious by what he did.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.960]   Remember the temple that Jesus comes in
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.360]   and he cleanses the temple, right?
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.260]   And he does that twice during his ministry.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.160]   Well, that temple was built by this king, King Herod.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.460]   Now you look at that and say,
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.360]   "Well, he must have cared about his religion.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.060]   He must have clearly had some affection for God."
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.760]   But this same king who made the temple,
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:04.860]   that same king also made dozens of pagan temples.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.060]   So this guy wasn't the king of Israel.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.760]   He was just a politician
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.460]   who was trying to appease both sides.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.460]   Now that in and of itself
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.260]   just kind of gives us a historical background
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.160]   of what's going on.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.260]   But this king was so paranoid
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.160]   that his own family members would usurp his authority
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.260]   that anybody that he considered a threat,
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.560]   he just murdered.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.160]   Kind of like what's going on in North Korea, right?
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.760]   Anybody that Kim Jong-un thinks is a threat, they're gone.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.360]   And that's basically what this king did.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.760]   So if that wasn't enough,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   it's made very clear, Matthew chapter 2, 16 to 17.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.060]   This king was so paranoid that,
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.560]   let me just read it for you in verse 16.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   It says, "Then when Herod saw
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.460]   that he had been tricked by the Magi,
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.360]   he became very enraged
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.160]   and slew all the male children
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.460]   who were in Bethlehem and all its vicinity,
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.760]   from two years old and under,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.560]   according to the time
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.960]   which he had determined from the Magi."
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.460]   Imagine if you were a young family of that time
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.760]   and you had a child under the age of two.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.260]   And this king, who wasn't even a Jew,
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.460]   he was an Edomite,
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.860]   who was a traitor to his people.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.560]   And he was basically a politician
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.960]   setting up pagan nations, pagan temples,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.560]   now came and killed one of your children
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.060]   simply because he was afraid
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.260]   that one of those children were going to be
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.560]   usurping his authority,
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.660]   that he was going to be the king of the Jews,
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.260]   the true king of the Jews was coming.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.860]   And just for that alone,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.260]   he went and slaughtered all the children
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.960]   under the age of two.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.460]   Imagine the frustration, the anger,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.060]   the bitterness, the sadness
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.260]   that Israel was under at this time.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.560]   And they had no power.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.660]   And if they didn't submit,
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.260]   they would have come and completely destroyed them.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.160]   So there was constant turmoil
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.560]   among the Jewish nation.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:09.360]   And so mentioning Herod the Edomite,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.460]   just knowing the background,
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.960]   the context of which he says it,
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.560]   and all of this is to emphasize for us
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.360]   that this has become a dark period
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   in Israel's history.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.460]   Sin has become utterly sinful as a nation.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.560]   It's God gave them over to their lust,
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.060]   God gave them over to their passion,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.160]   God gave them over to what they pursued
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.060]   in their rebellion.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.460]   And as a result of that,
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.760]   this is the fruit of the nation of Israel.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.960]   But along with that,
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.660]   we have two other people mentioned here
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.860]   that on the surface doesn't make any sense.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.260]   Right? Zacharias.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.760]   Now we know he's a significant figure
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.360]   simply because he's in the Bible.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.160]   Why is Zacharias even mentioned?
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.960]   Right? Like President Biden today,
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.560]   right? He was a vice president
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.660]   for eight years under Obama.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.460]   What did you know about President Obama
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.060]   or President Biden today
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.460]   when he was vice president?
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.660]   Almost nothing. Right?
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.760]   Because usually what happens is
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.260]   if the president comes out
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.460]   and you do a piece on the president,
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.960]   and you may do a little side piece
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.760]   on the vice president
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.860]   because his whole job is if he dies,
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.360]   he'll step in.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.760]   So unless there's a danger of Obama dying,
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.560]   usually they'll just say,
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.860]   oh, this guy's a politician.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.760]   These are his views and they move on.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   Right? They don't do a piece about his mom,
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.360]   his dad, and you know,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.760]   and even Hunter Biden, what's going on.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   All of that was revealed
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.860]   because he's a president.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   But while he was vice president,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.160]   nobody really cared.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.960]   Remember President Bush?
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.560]   Right? Remember his vice president?
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.060]   Remember who he was?
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.060]   Most of you, many of you
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.160]   probably already forgot.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.260]   Right? Dick Cheney.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.360]   Do you remember his wife's name?
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:05.260]   Mrs. Cheney. Right?
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.660]   We don't know.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.260]   You don't know anything about
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.360]   Dick Cheney's wife or husband,
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.960]   not husband, but mom or dad.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.860]   You don't know because he was just a side piece.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.960]   Right? Just in case Bush dies.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.560]   But we don't know much about him.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.260]   So imagine if the president is,
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.560]   you know, they're running for president.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.760]   They do a piece about the vice president.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.560]   Not only the piece about the vice president,
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.360]   but his mom and dad.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.560]   You would never do that.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.360]   But that's exactly what happens here.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.660]   He says he's going to give an orderly account
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.660]   and he starts with John the Baptist
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.960]   who's supposed to go six months before him
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.360]   and then spends almost a whole chapter
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.560]   talking about Zacharias and Elizabeth.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.460]   So we have to ask like,
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.960]   why is he, why are they in here?
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.760]   What's the purpose?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.260]   Why is he being highlighted?
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.160]   Clearly there must be a purpose.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.660]   Zacharias' name literally means
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.960]   God has remembered again.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.660]   Just by the name, you know what's going on.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.160]   His name means God has remembered again.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.460]   Not God has remembered,
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.160]   not God has forgotten,
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.760]   but God has remembered again.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.560]   And the reason why this is significant
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.660]   is because all throughout Israel's history
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:28.260]   is a repeat cycle over and over again.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.060]   You know, many people study the book of Hosea
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.860]   and they come out and say,
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.560]   well, it's a great love story
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.160]   between God and sinful nation
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.760]   and how God is so patient.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.360]   God tells Hosea to marry this prostitute,
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.860]   basically, who continues to commit adultery against him
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.360]   and God continues to chase after him
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.860]   and he illustrates this
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   between the relationship with Hosea and Gomer.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.460]   And typically we come out saying,
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.260]   well, what a beautiful story of God's
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.160]   unconditional love towards sinners.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.360]   Now that may be true,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.960]   but if you study the book of Hosea carefully,
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.260]   Hosea is actually a rebuke to the nation.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.860]   It's not just saying,
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.460]   oh, look how much God loves us.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.760]   Now, all that is true,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.260]   but if you study it,
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.560]   the end result is because
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.360]   God has given you chance after chance
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.960]   after chance after chance
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.260]   and you continue to commit adultery,
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.360]   but the Assyrians are coming,
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.660]   the nations are coming
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.660]   and you're going to be under their bondage.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.760]   And for 900 years this happens.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.960]   But along with the judgment
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.260]   against the nation of Israel,
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.360]   almost every prophet that brings judgment upon Israel,
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.060]   God always ends,
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.160]   almost always ends with a glimmer of hope.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.460]   That hope is mentioned in Hosea chapter 14,
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.860]   four through six is I will heal their apostasy.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.160]   I will love them freely for my anger has turned away from them.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   I will be like the dew to Israel.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.760]   He will blossom like the lily
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.360]   and he will take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.860]   His shoots will sprout
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.760]   and his beauty will be like the olive tree
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.460]   and his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.960]   Can you imagine if you heard everything that Hosea was saying
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.860]   and the captivity actually happens exactly like Hosea said,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.560]   they would be holding on to this passage
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.960]   and say when is this going to happen?
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.360]   We get it. We sinned. We made a mistake.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.960]   We want to repent but when is this going to happen?
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.860]   They waited 900 years for the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.360]   Now God initiated it.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.560]   The final fulfillment will happen at the end.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.160]   But this is what they were waiting for.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   And so when Zacharias appears God has remembered again.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.760]   Despite your sins God has not forgotten again.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.460]   He will remember you. Zacharias
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.760]   it says was a priest of the order of Abijah
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.560]   and Elizabeth is a descendant of Aaron himself.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:05.660]   And so they were priests together.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:09.860]   And again to better understand what's going on here.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.960]   There were 18,000 priests at that time.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   Of 18,000 priests and obviously they're not,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.160]   you know, you don't need that many people to go in
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:19.860]   and out of the temple.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.560]   So they divided into 24 orders.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.260]   And so he was under one of those orders Abijah.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.060]   And so if your group happened to be chosen you came
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.560]   and serve one or two weeks out of the year whole year
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.360]   and out of that they would throw lots
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   and whoever gets chosen one priest would represent
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.960]   and go into the Holy, Holy, not the Holy of Holies.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.860]   And then they were able to light the candle representing
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.860]   the prayers of the nation.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.260]   That's why all the priests are sitting standing outside praying
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.360]   for the nation and that one priest
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.260]   that he was chosen would go in
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.560]   and light these candles representing the prayers.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.860]   You have to understand for a priest that's
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.760]   like winning the lottery
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.160]   because majority of them have never,
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.860]   would never have this privilege.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:13.060]   Now John the Baptist was prophesied 400 years
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.860]   before he came.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.060]   So Zacharias is the father that was necessary
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.060]   for the son to come.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:27.360]   Yet all of this happens on the surface seems like by chance.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.260]   Even his choosing you would think that,
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.060]   you know, Zacharias if some angel would appear
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.160]   and say Zacharias you come inside.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.360]   Instead a lot takes place and then just randomly,
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.160]   it's like rolling dice.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.860]   It falls on him and he wins the lottery
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.260]   and he goes into to light the candle.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.860]   What seems chaotic and random on the surface is never random
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.760]   because we believe in a sovereign God.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.660]   In Proverbs 16 32, it says the lot is cast into the lap,
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.960]   but it's every decision is from the Lord.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.060]   Even the lot casting.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.860]   Remember in Acts chapter 2 after Judas betrays,
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.360]   there's only 11 apostles left
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.060]   and they need to fill the number 12.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.560]   And so they decide that they have some parameters
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   that they need to be somebody that was with the Lord
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.360]   and saw his life and was there when he was resurrected
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.960]   and they break it down to two people Matthias
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   and Barsabbas.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.660]   Now both of them qualify,
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.860]   but now they didn't need to choose one
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.660]   and they cast lots.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:35.760]   This is the 12th person of the apostles
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.160]   who's going to have an eternal position
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.760]   and yet it was cast by lots,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.360]   you know, you say the other 11 you said,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.960]   well Jesus chose me.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.360]   Right? You're going to eternity and Matthias,
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.060]   how did you get here?
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.560]   It's like, oh they cast lots.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.560]   Jesus didn't choose you.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.760]   It's like, well, he kind of did
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.460]   but through the apostles through the lots, right?
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.560]   So it seems so random
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.160]   that a 12th person of the apostle
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.160]   will be chosen in that way.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.260]   But God says again,
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.160]   he didn't just randomly choose anybody.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.860]   He said he met the criteria,
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.960]   but God chose him through the lots.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.460]   So again, my point is on the surface,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.360]   it seems like nothing.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.560]   It seems random,
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.160]   but clearly God has a purpose.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.460]   He's breaking into the darkness through this man
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.660]   to remind the nation of Israel
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.460]   that the Messiah is coming.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.860]   The rest of the time I want to spend
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.960]   on what's happening with Elizabeth.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.660]   It says in verse 6
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.360]   and you really have to pay attention to this
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.560]   because there's a,
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.760]   this is really the main point
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.560]   of what he's trying to say here.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.060]   They were both righteous in the sight of God
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.160]   walking blamelessly in all the commandments
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.460]   and requirements of the Lord.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.060]   Let me stop right there.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.860]   Clearly he's not talking about judicially
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.160]   he was innocent before God.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.360]   The whole reason why Jesus came
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.660]   is because all have sinned
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.760]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.460]   He's saying that in their walk,
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.260]   just like Apostle Paul says in Philippians chapter 3
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.560]   that when it's according to the law,
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   he was blameless, right?
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.960]   He was perfect.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.760]   Meaning that he lived his life
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.060]   to fulfill the law
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.960]   and to obey to the best of his ability.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.860]   Doesn't mean that he was innocent before God.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.460]   You know, the reason why I mentioned that
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.660]   is because I hear a lot of times people saying
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.760]   that there's nothing we can do to please God
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.060]   or displease God once we're justified.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.660]   No, the Bible makes it clear.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:32.360]   You can live a life that displeases God.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.860]   You can live a life that honors and pleases God.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.760]   That's clear in the scripture.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.060]   And that's what he's referring to
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.960]   that Elizabeth and Zachariah
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.460]   lived an honorable law abiding
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.260]   to the point where God was pleased with them.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.360]   But the point that he's trying to make is
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   in the commandment and requirements of the law,
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.960]   but they had no child.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.960]   But they had no, why does he say it like that?
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.860]   They had no child because he lives with barren
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.060]   and they were both advanced in years.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.960]   Now again, understand,
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.560]   these are John the Baptist's parents.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.260]   John the Baptist was prophesied 400 years ago
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.660]   that before the Messiah comes,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.160]   John the Baptist has to come.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:22.860]   Yet his parents couldn't bear children.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.360]   In fact, it says they were advanced in years.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.860]   The reason why they contrast their barrenness
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.660]   and their righteousness is because at that time
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.360]   if you had any kind of physical ailment,
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.260]   they attached it to some spiritual defect.
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.560]   We see that clearly in John chapter 9, 1 to 3.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   When they're walking by and they see a blind man,
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.360]   it said he passed, he saw a man blind from birth
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.660]   and his disciples asked him,
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.160]   "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.760]   that he would be born blind?"
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.560]   Jesus answered, "It was neither that this man sinned
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.360]   nor his parents, but it was so that the works of God
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.460]   might be displayed in him."
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.660]   You see the prejudice that they had toward him?
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.260]   They just automatically assumed
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.960]   that he must be blind because he must have deserved it
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.860]   or maybe the parents did something, they deserved it.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:18.660]   And this was a common prejudice against anybody
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.260]   who had some sort of a physical defect.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.660]   So, I mean, you could imagine like, again,
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.960]   we live in a culture where, you know,
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.160]   we have all kinds of rules and even in the church,
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.360]   like the bathrooms have to be certain height or,
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.260]   you know, like you have to make the entrances a certain way
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.760]   and it's like all kinds of stuff that somebody
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.560]   who's in a wheelchair could have easy access, right?
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.760]   I mean, at this particular time,
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.360]   not only did they have difficulty just live,
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.160]   people assumed that there was some sort of curse on you
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.560]   because you had some sort of defect.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.060]   So, can you imagine how their life was like?
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:02.560]   In fact, not only did the culture view it that way,
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.660]   many times even the families thought that the only way
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.760]   to remove themselves from the curse
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.660]   is remove that person from their own family.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.360]   And if you know the story in John chapter 9,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.460]   that's exactly what happens.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.860]   After he opens his eyes,
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.160]   his parents wouldn't even stick up for him
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.860]   because they were afraid that they were going to be shunned
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.760]   by shunning the synagogue.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.660]   So, they said, "Well, I don't know."
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.660]   They could have easily said,
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.860]   "Clearly he was blind all his life.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.560]   Clearly there was a miracle."
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.960]   But out of fear, they said, "No, no, no, you talk to him."
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.460]   And that was the attitude of that time.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:40.760]   So, can you imagine the suffering,
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:46.660]   the shame that somebody who was barren at that time?
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.960]   Clearly something, something must be going on with them.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.360]   In fact, in the Talmud,
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.060]   Talmud is basically the commentaries
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.660]   that the rabbis created to interpret the law.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.260]   And in the Talmud, they said,
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:07.260]   "A man is no longer bound to his barren wife
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:12.160]   after 10 years if she does not bear a child."
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.860]   And he is, by law, law that they created,
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:21.160]   that he can just dismiss her
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.860]   if she doesn't bear him a child in 10 years.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.960]   And he is able to do that up to two times, right?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.560]   Sorry, third time.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.860]   I mean, so if you were barren at that time,
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.560]   not only do you have the pain of not being able to have a child,
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.560]   you have the law that's against you.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.160]   You have your own family that's against you.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.060]   And you have the shame that you have to live with.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.060]   So he says, "They were born,
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.560]   they were both righteous in the sight of God,
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   walking in blamelessness,
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:58.760]   but despite that, she couldn't have children."
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   As painful as this must have been,
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:04.860]   God clearly has a purpose.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.660]   Just like when Lazarus was dead,
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.660]   he said, "This is not going to end in death.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.560]   This is for God's glory."
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.660]   And that's exactly what he does here.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:19.760]   This, you know, having children,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.560]   bearing children, and not being able to have children,
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.760]   you know, if you haven't experienced that,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.360]   you don't know the pain that comes with that, right?
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.660]   Now, obviously, I have four children.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.860]   But early on, when we first got married,
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.060]   Esther went through the first miscarriage, right?
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.160]   And then had to go through the operation,
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.860]   and I could see how she was devastated.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.260]   Went to the hospital and did some blood work,
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.860]   and they basically told her that you couldn't have children
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.160]   the normal way.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.060]   And I remember going through that,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.860]   and at that time, we were pretty young.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.660]   So my thought was, "We'll adopt it."
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.160]   Or, "We won't have children,
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.460]   and we'll have plenty of time to do ministry,
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.960]   go out, become missionaries, plant churches,
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.260]   visit churches to go speaking."
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.760]   And so, "Okay," you know?
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.260]   That's what I was thinking, the insensitive man.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.360]   But in the back of my mind, I said, "Oh."
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.460]   They actually said she has some sort of a blood disorder
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.560]   that fights pregnancy,
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.060]   and she can't have children the normal way.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.560]   Well, she got pregnant a second time,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.160]   and I remember when she was pregnant,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.560]   and we thought that maybe she was going to have
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.360]   another miscarriage.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.860]   And right around that time, I went up to a retreat,
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.660]   and at the retreat, we had older people
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.760]   who were giving testimonies,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.260]   and one lady who was about 10 years ahead of me in age,
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.560]   and she started sharing about her testimony.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.460]   And in her testimony, she said that she had five miscarriages,
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.560]   and she still didn't have a child.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.060]   And they've been married for a long time.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.560]   But what really got me was, as she was sharing that,
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.960]   she was starting to break down, and she said,
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.660]   by the time she had her fifth miscarriage,
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:07.960]   she said, by her own words, "I no longer feel like a woman."
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.560]   I remember when I listened to that,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.860]   I mean, my heart ached for her,
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.160]   but at the same time, I was thinking,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.360]   "Is this what Esther's going through?"
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.760]   I remember I came back from that,
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.660]   and I didn't really share this with Esther,
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.160]   but I started going to morning prayer.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.860]   Every morning at 5 o'clock, I would go there,
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.660]   and that's all I prayed for during her pregnancy.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.960]   I prayed, I prayed, "Lord, please answer this prayer.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.660]   Please let her have this.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.660]   Please, please, please."
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.360]   And then, sure enough, she had her miscarriage.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.660]   If there's any one period in my prayer life
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.860]   where I was severely disappointed
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.260]   was during that period.
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.660]   I mean, there's a lot of things I prayed for a long time,
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.960]   but I can only think of a handful of things
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.660]   where I literally cried out to God and pled before God,
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.760]   and for several months, prayed, "Lord, answer, answer.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.060]   May this be for your glory.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.660]   May this be for your glory."
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.060]   And then when she had the miscarriage,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.760]   I remember thinking, "Where are you?"
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.060]   You know, I dedicated my life, you know.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.060]   We let go of material goods.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.460]   We're willing to suffer for your kingdom,
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.960]   and you won't answer this prayer?"
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.560]   And I never shared this with anybody,
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.460]   but I remember the disappointment
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.360]   that I felt during that period.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.560]   Third child comes along, right, pregnancy,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.460]   and we already are thinking she's not going to have this child.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.260]   She goes to the hospital,
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.960]   and the doctor says, "You had another miscarriage."
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.760]   And so, we just, by that time, we've accepted it.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   She's not going to be able to have children normal way.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.560]   We didn't have enough money to think about adoption.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.760]   We were just thinking, "Well, let's see what happens."
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.060]   And so, after that initial appointment,
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.360]   she came back and just lived a normal life, you know.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.460]   And at that time, I was a youth pastor,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.160]   so I remember taking the kids to Magic Mountain,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.960]   and she rode the roller coaster and did all of that,
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.360]   didn't take any medicine, nothing, right,
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.460]   drank coffee, whatever you're not supposed to do.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.660]   She did everything, right?
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.960]   And at the end of fifth month, she just went in for a checkup,
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.760]   just to see, right, just to make sure
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.660]   that everything has been moved from the body.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.260]   And she came back, and the way she came through the door,
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.460]   I knew something was wrong.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.760]   And she said, "The baby's living."
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.560]   And I thought, "What?
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.060]   They already told us that we lost him."
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.460]   And she came back with an ultrasound.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.560]   She's like, "Oops."
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.660]   So we don't know.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.560]   I mean, maybe the doctor was just automatically assuming
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.660]   she's not going to be able to have a baby,
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.660]   so she maybe didn't examine carefully.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.560]   But whatever happened was we've already accepted that,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.860]   and we knew the emotions behind all of that.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.960]   And I can tell you, each one of our kids,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.060]   we had some drama behind.
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.360]   And God allow us at least to emotionally feel
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.260]   what it's like to possibly have a kid with Down syndrome.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.860]   We had another kid that we thought was, you know,
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.260]   was premature and was in the incubator for a couple months.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.060]   And then we had faith.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.460]   [laughter]
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.160]   Well, each one of us, I'm not going to go into all of that,
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.660]   but God allowed us to feel the emotions behind the heartache
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.060]   that many parents go through in different situations.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:41.360]   But I can tell you that not being able to have a child,
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.760]   I understand.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.960]   And I know there's a lot of people in our generation
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.560]   that because of this desire,
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.360]   there's a temptation to compromise our Christian ethics,
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.060]   to do things against the will of God.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.660]   I'm not going to get into that this morning,
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.960]   but I want to encourage you.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.960]   Our God is sovereign.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.760]   What's happening in your life isn't by mistake.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.060]   It's not because of a satanic attack.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.960]   Trust God.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.560]   Whether you end up having a child or not having a child,
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.760]   trust God.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.360]   You know what's interesting about this story?
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   There's major markers in how God's covenant is being fulfilled.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.760]   And each one of those markers, it comes through a barren woman.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.160]   You remember Sarah?
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.860]   Had Isaac.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.560]   She was barren.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.460]   Rebecca had Jacob.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.660]   She was barren.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.660]   Rachel had Joseph.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.060]   She was barren.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.760]   Hannah had Samuel, and she was barren.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.560]   This is not by accident.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.960]   God is trying to convey something here.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.860]   That doesn't mean that if you have a hard time having a child,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.560]   that if you trust God, that you're going to have four children.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.960]   It doesn't mean that.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:17.260]   But what it does mean is that our God is completely sovereign.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:22.060]   That even in the most randomest and difficult and the darkest situation,
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.760]   God has not lost control.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.060]   The reason why Elizabeth and this story is here,
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.060]   which seems random on the surface,
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.360]   is because God prophesied this.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.360]   In Isaiah 54, 1 through 8, it says,
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.960]   "Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have born no child.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.760]   Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   You who have not prevailed, for the sons of the desolate one
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.560]   will be more numerous than the sons of the married woman," says the Lord.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.060]   "Enlarge the place of your tent.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.760]   Stretch out the curtains of your dwelling.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.560]   Spare not.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.760]   Lengthen your cords and strengthen your pegs,
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.560]   for you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.260]   and your descendants will possess nations and will resettle the desolate cities.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.560]   Fear not, for you will not be put to shame.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   Do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced,
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.860]   but you will forget the shame of your youth
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.760]   and the reproach of your widowhood you will remember no more,
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.060]   for your husband is your maker,
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   whose name is the Lord of hosts,
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.060]   who is called the God of all the earth.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.360]   For the Lord has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.060]   even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected," says your God.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.060]   "For a brief moment I forsook you,
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.260]   but with great compassion I will gather you.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.860]   In an outburst of anger I hid my face from you for a moment,
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.160]   but with everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you,"
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.360]   says the Lord, your Redeemer.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.060]   What seems random on the surface is not random at all.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.160]   When God says that He remembers every strand of hair on our head,
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.860]   He means it.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.160]   You know, we're in a wedding season right now.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   You know, we have almost a wedding every week.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.360]   And so I was at one yesterday and I remember just sitting around with
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.460]   all our bereaved and some of them that I've known for almost 20 years.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.160]   And we're thinking about how weddings used to be a long time ago, right?
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.860]   15, 20 years ago when, was it 20? I forgot how long it was, but a while back, right?
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.360]   How many years were you married, Joe?
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.660]   18. So 18 years. They were the first couple at our church, right?
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.360]   But at then, most people did not have wedding coordinators
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.460]   because I was their wedding coordinator.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:35.760]   Because we had the whole church involved.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.160]   So whenever they got married, you know, I'd get,
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.660]   I'd gather up the people and say, "We need to shift.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.660]   Their wedding's at four. We're going to show up at two o'clock
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.860]   and we're going to set up the tables and, you know, help serve the food."
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.460]   And then after the wedding was over, we would stay longer and clean up
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.160]   and we would say bye to them as they go
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.460]   and then we would stay behind and clean up for them.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.660]   It was like that in the beginning because our church was smaller.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.960]   And so every wedding was a huge celebration, right?
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.960]   It made all of us feel like grown-ups, right?
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.060]   Stuck around and it's like, "Oh, they're getting married."
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.560]   And so every event, they didn't even have to send out invitations
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.660]   because our church was small. It was just assumed, right?
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:13.560]   And so they would come.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.760]   Like a lot of college students who had no idea who they were,
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.660]   they would just show up on Saturday because they had nothing to do.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.260]   But that was all calculated into the meals and into the celebration.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:24.160]   So we're just reminiscing about that and how it used to be
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.660]   and, you know, how every celebration when people had hardship,
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.460]   we were all there together, cried together, laughed together.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.760]   But one of the difficulties now that the church is bigger,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.260]   it's hard, right?
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.960]   You know, it's hard to even get to know everybody.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.160]   And so that's one of the things that happens when the church is big.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.760]   And I know there's some of you who were there like 20 years ago
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.360]   thinking, "Oh, you know, only if it was like that,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.960]   only when it was a long time ago."
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.760]   But obviously we're growing because God is blessing us.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.560]   There's people coming to hear the Word and so greater things are happening.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.860]   But sometimes when you think about it, it is a bit sad
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:03.060]   because I know people who are going through hardship
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.860]   and can't be there for all of it.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.160]   A lot of you have gone through a lot of hardship in the last two years.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.860]   There's things that you're celebrating and we can't make it there.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:15.860]   Like just yesterday, we had two weddings on the same day.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:20.360]   As we wrestle and struggle with that,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.160]   as much as I would like to be there,
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.860]   I am not your true shepherd.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.960]   I'm only an under shepherd.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.660]   What I cannot do, God does.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.960]   God does.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.160]   Whether you are 50, 500, 1,000, or 10,000, or a billion,
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.660]   our God is sovereign and He cares.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:55.460]   Even for a barren woman in her old age,
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.460]   even for this old couple who may have lost all hope,
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:05.460]   that as He comes to save the world,
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.960]   He comes to this couple
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   who would have no other hope than the love of Jesus Christ.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:20.460]   That's the sympathetic high priest that we love, that we worship.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.960]   And so as we continue to study the book of Luke,
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   as I mentioned, as His humanity is presented to us,
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   as His compassion we're able to see up close,
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   that you would remember,
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   He says, "We have a high priest who sympathizes with our weaknesses.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   Therefore, come to the throne of grace.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   Enter the throne with confidence to seek help in time of need."
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.960]   So my prayer is that we would know this Jesus,
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   that God would not just be some figurehead,
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.460]   some power up above who created the universe
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.460]   and just kind of disappeared from the background,
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.460]   that we worship from a distance,
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.960]   but that we would see His love for us,
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   that we would desire more than anything else to be near to this Jesus.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.460]   Let's pray.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:16.460]   God, what an awesome God you are.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:26.460]   Lord, as we remember that you remembered Zacharias and Elizabeth,
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.460]   countless number of people who came before them,
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:38.460]   countless number of hurting and aching souls that came after them,
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:45.960]   all reminding us that you care for us, that you love us,
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.460]   that we are not insignificant in your sight.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.460]   We pray, Father God, that you would soften our hearts,
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:59.460]   help us to see our sympathetic high priest,
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.960]   that we would love him as he loves us,
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.460]   that we would worship him as he deserves.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:09.960]   May Christ and Christ alone be magnified.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.460]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.460]   Amen.
