[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   Good morning.
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.100]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.200]   We're going to be reading from verse 1 through 4.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.780]   And main text today is going to be on one verse, verse 4.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.220]   Again, I promise we are going to be going faster than just one verse a week.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.860]   It's just that we want to make sure that we cover this and set the right foundation before
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.100]   we get to the other heroes of the faith.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.880]   So Hebrews chapter 11, verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800]   I want to read all four verses before we get started this morning.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.160]   Reading out of the NASV.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.600]   Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440]   For by it the men of old gained approval.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.880]   By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.200]   is seen was not made out of things which are invisible.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   that he was righteous.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.320]   God testifying about his gifts and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.720]   Let's pray.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.360]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your anointing over this time.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.200]   May your word have its effect on us.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   Help us, Lord God, to hear from you and to glean from this verse, this passage, what
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.240]   it is that you have desired.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   I pray that you would give us eagerness, Lord God, to hear from you, that we may apply all
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   that you have to say.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.760]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.760]   Amen.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   All right, again, I want to apologize if you are not a Lakers fan.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   I'm going to mention this just for today, okay, just for today and then next week maybe
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   consider it again.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.840]   Okay, but again, as you guys know, Lakers won their 17th championship, tying the record
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   for the Celtics.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.280]   So now they're tied, so next year they'll break it, I'm assuming.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.960]   Okay, but after every game that happens, and obviously, like, they'll put up the banner
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.400]   up there, it's the 17th championship banner, and then they'll have the Hall of Famers,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.480]   who, jerseys have been retired, and obviously, Kobe's was retired, and then, you know, eventually
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   other people will get retired.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.320]   And the reason why they do that is obviously to venerate, you know, just to kind of honor
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.360]   that these are the teams that win, won the championship team, and the new people that
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.560]   have come and that they put, retired their jersey and put it up there to inspire people,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   right?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.760]   When they look up, this is what Lakers is about, this is what you should aspire for.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.400]   But obviously, you can look at that and the new players coming in, maybe get intimidated
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.200]   and think, "I will never be able to live up to that."
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.260]   Now, obviously, these guys are Hall of Fame basketball players, so it's not assumed that
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.480]   every basketball player, in fact, more than 99% of the players that come in and play for
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.060]   Lakers are not going to have their jerseys retired like that.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.360]   But the reason why they do that is not simply to intimidate, but to inspire.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   So they're kind of like the Hall of Fame, or, you know, the heroes, basically, of Lakers,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.920]   if you're a Lakers fan.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   I say all of this because Chapter 11 is a Hall of Fame for people of faith.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   And so everything that the author has been saying has been leading up to Chapter 11,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   saying that not to drift, but here's some examples of people who live by faith and what
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.520]   does this faith look like.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.880]   And then after he does that, starting from Chapter 12, he's going to point back to them
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.960]   saying, "Considering the cloud of witnesses, this Hall of Fame people who live by faith,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.360]   that we ought to follow that example and continue to persevere in our faith."
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.320]   So today is the first person in the Hall of Fame, so he's like the first, you know, first
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.280]   retired jersey that we're looking at today, right?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.720]   So we're looking at verse 4, and it starts out of the story between Abel and Kane, how
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.600]   Abel's offering was acceptable and Kane's offering was not.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.560]   Just to kind of, before we even jump into it, that we understand what's going on.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.360]   The story of Kane and Abel is the first generation of people who were born into sin.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   Now Adam and Eve were not born into sin.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280]   They fell because they chose to sin.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.640]   So the first generation of people, the first fruits of Adam and Eve after they fell was
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   a murderer.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   And it is not by accident.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.920]   The stories that we see in the Old Testament and New Testament are not a collection of
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.240]   random things that happen, and just kind of telling us this is what happened.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.340]   So whenever we study the Bible, you know, we're doing inductive study of 1 Thessalonians,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.480]   one of the key things that we have to constantly ask is, how does this fit into the context?
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   Not only the context of the immediate text of the letter of the Old Covenant and New
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.080]   Covenant, but in his redemptive, in the meta-narrative of the Bible, in the redemptive history, where
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.360]   does this fit?
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   Why is this story here?
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.680]   Other than to just tell us that Adam and Eve had children and they ended up, you know,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640]   the first one ended up murdering.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   Well, we're going to see here what he says here is really foundational to our faith.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.600]   What he says in this one verse really sets the table of how we understand the rest of
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.420]   redemptive history.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.640]   And so hopefully we will be able to unpack that together this morning.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.200]   So I want to look at verse 4 again, just verse 4, and then we're going to deal with two things
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.040]   that he says here this morning.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.160]   Verse 4, "By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain."
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   So that's the first point we're going to look at.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.940]   It was a better sacrifice.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.760]   What made this a better sacrifice?
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.520]   And then 2, "Through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous."
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.480]   Through the better sacrifice, Abel became righteous.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.720]   God testifying about his gift and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.960]   What is it about his testimony?
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.340]   What is it about him becoming righteous that is still speaking to us today?
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.120]   So that's the second part we're going to be looking at.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.280]   Okay, so let's look at the first part.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.880]   He says, "Abel offered a better sacrifice."
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   So in order for us to better understand what is going on here, it's good for us to understand
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.040]   what is a sacrifice.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   Another way of saying a sacrifice is an offering, right?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.080]   Now, in our modern-day worship, we don't use the word sacrifice.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   Typically, when we say sacrifice, we're talking about giving up something that is valuable
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   to us.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.320]   But here, in the context of sacrifice, it's talking about offering.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.120]   An offering is what is given in the context of worship.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.480]   So another way to say this is God looked at the offering that Abel gave and he says, "Abel's
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.960]   offering was a better offering."
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   "Abel's offering was a better offering."
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.880]   So what is laid here basically is telling us, through the story of Cain and Abel, what
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   worship is acceptable and what worship is not acceptable.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.640]   And the reason why this is so foundational, the Bible says that we are created for the
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.520]   purpose of worship.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:09.080]   So if our central identity, central identity, is not what nationality, what language you
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.160]   speak or your economic status, right?
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.920]   Our first identity was as a worshiper.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.200]   God says he created us in his image, to bear his image.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.760]   In other words, we were to reflect his glory.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   And so when he says to Adam and Eve that this is acceptable worship, this is not acceptable
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.320]   worship, he's laying the foundation for sinners to be able to come to him.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   Again, this is why this is so important.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.840]   Worship is at the core of who we are.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.960]   Now in order to better understand what worship is, again I'm going to use the analogy of
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.600]   sports, right?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.240]   If you are a casual fan, let's say if you're, I would say I'm not a fanatic, I would say
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   I'm a fan.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.600]   You know, I enjoy watching Lakers, but I don't, my car is not purple and gold, I don't have
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.840]   purple and gold underwear, I don't have purple and gold socks, you know, and you see some
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.640]   fanatics when you go to the arena, I mean they are fanatics, they'll paint their face,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.080]   you know, they'll take off their shirt, they'll have their favorite, you know, favorite player's
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.520]   number printed on their chest, there's no shame, right?
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   And we would say they're not just fans, they're not just casual fans, they are fanatics.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.120]   If you go into their room, their room is painted purple and gold, right?
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.160]   And they know the shoe sizes of every player, they know when they got married, how many
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.400]   children they have and their stats, and they know everything, right?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.440]   So a fan is somebody who just casually enjoys it from a distance, and if they happen to
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.920]   be in championship, we get kind of get on board and we find excitement in that, but
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:49.480]   a fanatic is day and night, 24/7, that's what he does.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.880]   So the difference between a fan and a fanatic, a fanatic, that's his primary thing that brings
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080]   him the greatest joy.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.360]   That's it, that's what brings him the greatest joy.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.760]   He's willing to become a fool, he's willing to spend a lot of money.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.520]   In fact, most fanatics, their friends will actually tell them to calm down, right?
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.720]   Most fans are like, yeah, you know, we're going to get together and watch, you know,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.240]   watch basketball together, but if you're a fanatic, you probably have some friends that
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   are concerned about you, you know, you're spending too much money, you're, too much
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.920]   time, too much energy in that.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:39.000]   See, in the context of worship, God did not call us to be fans.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   He called us to be fanatics, because the Bible says, what is the greatest commandment?
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.920]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.120]   He says what God is looking for, people are going to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.080]   He said, you will seek me and find me if you seek for me with what?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.120]   With all your heart.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   God is commanding us to be fanatics of who he is.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.580]   Now when we look at that, because typically when we think of a fanatic, we think about
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.280]   somebody who went too far.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.920]   But the reason why he commands and desires fanatics of who he is, is because he is the
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.440]   author of life.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.720]   And the moment that we are separated from him, there we find death.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.480]   So the only way that we can truly experience true life is to reconnect with the author
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.540]   of life.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.880]   So his commandment, to love him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, is really
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.160]   for our benefit, because that's what he created us for.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.880]   In the church, it doesn't take much to make fans.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.880]   If we have enough people your age, with similar interests, if there's nice people on our welcome
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.760]   team, if the leaders aren't too boring, and they have an embezzled money, and it's like,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.360]   "Ah, we can follow that," and they're somewhat interesting, it doesn't take a lot to make
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.160]   fans of people.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.440]   But a fanatic is not something that you can create, unless that person really finds the
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   greatest joy in this.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.720]   Only an individual who has genuinely encountered this God will become a fanatic.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:33.180]   And that's the struggle that we have in our generation, because there seems to be no distinction
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.680]   between a fan and a fanatic.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.960]   In fact, every once in a while, there is somebody maybe who takes it too far and says, "You
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.180]   should go into ministry.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.640]   You should become a missionary, because you're not like the rest of us."
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.920]   Without realizing that that person may be doing exactly what God has called all of us
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.680]   to do.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.620]   You can become a fanatic of pretty much anything.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.280]   If you are a fanatic of making money, you are willing to do whatever it takes to make
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   money.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.460]   If you're a fanatic of friendship, if you're a fanatic of prestige, if that's where you
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.040]   find your greatest joy and greatest life, you're willing to sacrifice anything.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.720]   You're willing to become a fool.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.400]   Years ago, when we first started going out to India, and I remember the very first year
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   we went, even our missionary friends were telling us, "Don't go there, because there's
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   not a lot of support out there."
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.280]   And there's a few of us that went there that first year, and we literally went into the
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   boonies.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.400]   We got off in Bangalore, and we took five hours to drive out to Bellary, and then from
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.040]   Bellary, we had at least about two hours to drive to the village, and it really felt like
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   the boonies.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.840]   I would say about a third of the road was paved, and the other two thirds was like dirt
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   road.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   And we were going hours and hours into the countryside, and we were thinking, "Man,
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.880]   if anything happens here, we would be completely lost."
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.400]   Well, once we got there, obviously, we're the only foreigners.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.080]   You don't see anything familiar there, and typically, whenever you travel, the first
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.240]   thing that you look for is either McDonald's or Starbucks, because there's some familiarity,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.000]   or at least some English, something that you're familiar with.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.080]   First year we went there, we saw nothing.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.520]   But as the years went by, we started seeing the roads being paved.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.400]   In fact, now, I would say more than two thirds, maybe about 90% of the road has been paved.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.280]   And now, the same hotel that we go to, we will see foreigners hanging out there.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.700]   So the first time I saw a foreigner like us, my initial thought was, "The only reason why
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.280]   anybody would be out here is the same reason we're here, is to share the gospel."
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   But we realized that through the years that India is starting to rise in their economy,
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.920]   so the more and more business people are coming into that area.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.240]   It's a mining town.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.720]   Hyundai came in and set up a huge factory out there, and that's part of the reason why
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.440]   the roads got paved.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:56.520]   But I can imagine the first group of people who came out there to make money, they had
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.840]   to do the same thing we did.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.360]   They had to come to a foreign place that they weren't familiar with, eat foods that they
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.320]   weren't familiar with, leave their family behind for a period to establish all that.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.200]   Now it's becoming more and more foreigner-friendly, but there were people who came out there and
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.800]   did the same thing that we did, all for the purpose of making money.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.360]   People all over the world will sacrifice, leave their families behind, sometimes even
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.180]   ruin their marriages because they are fanatics of money.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.720]   And in a place like that, I can only say, either you are a fan of money or you're a
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   fanatic of God.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.360]   That would bring somebody out to a place like that permanently, although we're only there
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.600]   for a short period of time.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.680]   See, God knows that if we are not a fanatic of God, most likely we are a fanatic of something
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.440]   else.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.240]   Because God created us for the purpose of worship.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.980]   You and I gain the greatest satisfaction in life when we live according to the way He
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.120]   created us.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.360]   So when we are not finding the satisfaction in life in Christ, and we are just casual
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.300]   fans, we are most likely fanatics of something else.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:18.140]   You either watching Korean drama, K-pop, I don't know what it is, maybe going to new
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.120]   places or finding friends or community, whatever it might be, buying new things, whatever it
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.420]   might be.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:31.260]   If we are not, if we don't find life in being a fanatic of Christ, whether you are aware
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.980]   or not aware of it, most likely you are a fanatic of something else.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:42.020]   Fanatic of security, fanatic of success, fanatic of money, fanatic of reputation, whatever
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.020]   that may be.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:50.040]   That you are willing to sacrifice, possibly cheat and lie in order to either hold on to
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.860]   it or to attain it.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.620]   See what God is saying here about Abel's offering is really a statement not only about
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.780]   Abel, but He is distinguishing between a worship that will lead to life and a worship that
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.460]   will lead to death.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.660]   See the background behind this, just so that we better understand what's going on here,
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.380]   in Genesis 4, 4-5 it describes Abel's offering.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.820]   It says, "Abel on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.820]   portions."
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.700]   Let me stop right there.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.420]   That's verse 4.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.140]   And then verse 3, it describes Cain's offering.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.740]   So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the Lord of fruit
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.740]   of the ground.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:38.260]   I don't know if we can put the two verses together simultaneously, but if you notice
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:45.620]   the difference between the sacrifice that is given by Abel, he says on his part he brought
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.620]   a firstling.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:53.980]   Firstling, meaning the very first, right, of whatever it is that he had, of the flock.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.500]   And then it is the fat portion.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.820]   So in those three descriptions, it's describing Abel's offering as the best of the flock and
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.440]   even of that, the most precious part of that animal.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.880]   But of Cain's, look what it says, "It came about in the course of time that Cain brought
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.760]   an offering."
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.780]   Not a first offering, not the best offering, it just says, "An offering to the Lord of
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.900]   the fruit of the ground."
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.900]   When you read that casually, just kind of reading through the Bible, you may not catch
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.900]   that.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.660]   But when we slow down and ask the question, "What made Abel's offering acceptable and
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:38.160]   what made Cain's offering unacceptable?" is the distinction between giving the best versus
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.660]   just giving.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.140]   A fan versus a fanatic.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.020]   Giving gave out of convenience.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.340]   This is what he did for a living.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.740]   So God required it, so I'm just going to give it to him.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.740]   Where Abel also gave of the flock, and he was a herder, but he gave what was best.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.220]   And even of the portion, he didn't keep the best portion to himself, but the fattest portion
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.200]   he offered it to God.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.860]   And it is in that, that by at least the initial distinction is between their attitude and
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.140]   the way that they gave.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.260]   It says in Isaiah 29 verse 13, "God has been saying this to the nation of Israel over and
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.260]   over and over again."
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.740]   It is the reason why they're going into captivity, it was because they kept on giving God defective
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   worship.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:30.660]   Isaiah 29 verse 13, "Then the Lord said, 'Because this people draw near with their words and
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.980]   honor me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from me, and their
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.260]   reverence for me consists of traditions learned by rote.'"
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.260]   Meaning habit.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.500]   You just did it because it's Sunday.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.660]   How often times do we come to worship simply because it's Sunday?
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.100]   How often do we come saying, "I'm going to worship God," or "I'm going to attend the
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.620]   worship."
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.540]   There is a difference between the two.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.860]   See, we can attend worship by just getting up, being clothed, and coming and sitting,
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.660]   and then when the worship starts, you sit, and when the worship ends, you go home, and
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.700]   you say, "You attended worship."
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.700]   But there's a difference between attending worship and actually worshiping God.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.820]   There's a huge difference between a fan and a fanatic.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:24.220]   A fan may come on board when it's exciting, but when it's not exciting, you can't tell.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.580]   Jesus says the same thing in the book of Matthew chapter 15, 8 through 9, "This people honors
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.140]   me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.300]   But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.100]   All they're doing is following rules."
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.100]   Rules that men made up.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.220]   So, you know, our order of worship, we made it up.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.220]   I made it up.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   Right?
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.420]   What do I think is the best way?
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.540]   You know, should we start first?
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.540]   Should we do the offering in the middle?
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.260]   Should we do it at the end?
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.020]   You know, should we have membership at church?
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.740]   How should we organize our Bible study?
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.140]   All of these things are obviously ways for us to get to God, but these are just rules
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.840]   created by men.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.420]   So if you go to another church, there's another set of rules.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.100]   If you go to another church, they have another set of rules.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.860]   And so he says, "All these people are doing is just following rules and attending worship,
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.700]   but they're not worshiping me."
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.320]   And that's a distinction that he's making.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.980]   An offering that we give, let's say if you're giving a gift to a friend, right, and you're
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.540]   giving it to that person and you put some thought into it.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.100]   You know, you sacrifice, you save that money, and the offering that you give to that person
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.300]   or the gift that you give to that person has a lot of meaning behind it because you pour
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.740]   your heart into it.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.580]   I had a friend, and I mentioned this before, who would always carry around precious moment
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.100]   dolls in his car.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.600]   He would always have three or four in his car because he would constantly forget anniversaries
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:54.060]   and birthdays, or maybe he said something dumb, you know, to his wife and his wife would
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.100]   be ticked off.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.840]   And so he had an immediate way out.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.180]   He would go to the back of his car, take out one of those precious moment dolls, and he
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.540]   would give it to her, right?
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.380]   So he figured out a way to appease her wrath.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.340]   And that's all he's doing.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.500]   He's not loving her, he's not taking care of her, that's self-centered.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.380]   I want to eat breakfast tomorrow, and the only way that I'm going to do that is appease
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.740]   this wrath.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.460]   And so he figured out a way, and she's okay, she's not happy with it, and she knew he was
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.900]   doing that, but he said, "Okay," you know, because she loved the doll so much, right?
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.460]   But that's not God.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.100]   God is not in love with dead animals.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.980]   He's not in love with singing.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.860]   And he's actually looking for the offering that we bring in our hearts.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.860]   And that's why he was constantly telling the nation of Israel that what you are doing is
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.860]   not worship.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:54.300]   In fact, he actually says that assembly of God's people at the temple was a burden to
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   him.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.500]   He actually says, calls it an evil assembly.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.980]   What he's, the distinction that he's making between Abel and Cain's offering is a distinction
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.060]   between life and death.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.180]   You look, you can see what was going on in Cain's heart by the way he responded when
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.900]   God points that out to him.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.220]   In fact, if you look at it carefully, God is actually very gracious to him.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.220]   Look what he says.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.940]   "Then the Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry?
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.700]   And why has your countenance fallen?
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.420]   If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?'"
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:34.660]   If you do well, basically meaning if you follow what I told you to do, if you did what Abel
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.220]   did, God is giving him an opportunity to repent.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.660]   He's not saying you did it wrong so you're going to die tomorrow.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.660]   He says no.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.860]   He said your whole situation would change if you would just repent.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:55.460]   Instead of being angry and jealous and having a serious countenance, if you do well, wouldn't
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.140]   your situation change?
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.780]   And if you do not do well, if you choose to remain on this path, he says sin is crouching
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.540]   at the door and its desire is for you, but you must master it.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:13.100]   If your pride and anger and jealousy, if you embrace that and allow that to percolate and
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.980]   bear fruit, he says sin basically is going to master you.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:25.180]   Either you repent and get it right and master it, or you allow it to percolate and bear
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.620]   fruit.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.980]   And we know exactly what happens.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:35.980]   Cain chooses to embrace this sin, and in his anger, he becomes the first murderer in human
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.140]   history.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.500]   In fact, in the book of Jude, verse 10 and 11, it describes, God describes Cain's sin
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.220]   this way, "But these men revile the things which they do not understand, and the things
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.380]   which they know by instinct.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.940]   Like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.340]   Woe to them, for they have gone the way of Cain."
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.580]   What is the way of Cain?
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.140]   Like an animal.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.780]   He just does whatever he feels.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.060]   And that's the difference between an animal and a human being.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.820]   He says he just does whatever.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.900]   An unreasoning animal who knows by instinct, he just does whatever he feels like.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   Whatever comes easiest.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.820]   I mean, animals don't have priorities.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.700]   They don't sit down and make a list of these are important things that I need to get to
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.260]   today and these are not important things that I don't need to get to.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.620]   These are things that I prioritize, these are things I don't need.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.060]   They don't live like that.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.140]   So something that they like, they want it.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.260]   You know, they get excited about something, they run.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.780]   They get scared, they stop.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   They get tired, they sleep.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.100]   If they're tired of sleeping, they get up and they run.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.120]   That's what he's describing the sin of Cain.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.380]   He's living by his flesh, whatever satisfies him.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.660]   The Bible describes the sin of Israel repeatedly over and over again in the same way.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.100]   He says in the book of Judges, their primary sin, every time God would be gracious and
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.220]   bring revival, they would fall right back into that sin because everyone did what was
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.580]   right in their own eyes.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.300]   Instead of following Christ or following God's precepts, everyone did what was right in their
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.260]   own eyes over and over and over again.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:30.020]   The Bible describes man's rebellion as simply doing and following and chasing what we want.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.900]   And most of the greatest temptations in life are not obviously sinful.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.020]   It's just, that's what I want.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.020]   That's what I desire.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.160]   I'm going to give to God whatever is convenient to me.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.980]   And beyond that, that's for the fanatics.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.220]   So I'm satisfied with just being a fan of who he is.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.500]   I'm going to give you another outdated song, Frank Sinatra.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.500]   Right?
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.420]   Some of you guys, most of you guys probably know who he is.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.100]   You guys know who Frank Sinatra is?
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   Okay.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.900]   So this guy is big enough that you guys would know.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.540]   He has a song called "I Did It My Way."
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.780]   I'm not going to read the whole thing, but just the first verse.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.180]   "And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.060]   My friends, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.340]   I've lived a life that's full.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.580]   I traveled each and every highway.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:30.860]   But more, much more than this, I did it my way."
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:36.700]   What he describes here in this song, the Bible describes as a way of destruction.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.340]   It is broad, it is easy, it is convenient, and you just make decisions and you just do
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.620]   whatever comes natural to you.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.360]   And what our flesh naturally desires is a road to destruction.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.660]   In Proverbs 12-14 it says, "There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.220]   the way of death.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.940]   Even in laughter, the heart may be in pain."
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.780]   You ever experience that, even as a Christian, where you know you're not walking right with
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.060]   God?
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.860]   And maybe you made some money, maybe your business did well, maybe your children were
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.980]   sick and then they became healthy, but even in the midst of that, you know that you are
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.860]   not walking the way God wants you to walk, and even in the midst of success, you experience
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.580]   emptiness and pain.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.660]   That's what he's describing here.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:36.700]   Because true life is only when we are connected to the author of life.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.340]   So if you experience, if you're chasing after life outside of Christ, that's what he's describing
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   here.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.540]   And in the end, joy may be grief.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:52.420]   That all your life, you experience one success after another success, after another success,
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.540]   and all your life, you can tell other people, "If you do what I do, you can be successful.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.580]   You can make all the money."
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.940]   And your life may be written in a book, saying that, "If you really want to be successful,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.860]   do this, because this is what I did."
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.580]   And at the end of that, he says, "It's grief."
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:16.460]   Because the only true life is found when we are connected to the author of life.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.020]   The backslider in heart will have his fill of his own ways.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:26.380]   A backslider in heart will have his fill of his own way.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:32.340]   He will continue to make decisions and go after things according to what he desires,
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.660]   but a good man will be established or be satisfied with his.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:43.060]   The distinction between Abel's offering and Cain's offering is a distinction between life
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.140]   and death.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:51.180]   God warns Cain that sin is crouching at your door, that this temptation is going to overpower
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.820]   you and lead you to destruction.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:04.340]   See, what we need to pay attention to here is faulty worship was what led to the first
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.340]   murder.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.260]   Let me say that again.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.940]   Faulty worship is what led to the first murder.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.260]   Now you may say, "You know, that's kind of hyperbole.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.260]   You're exaggerating."
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.280]   It's not directly connected.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.960]   But I think that's exactly the point that he's trying to make.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.380]   Because God created us for the purpose of worship, when we're not satisfied with the
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.520]   Creator, we end up chasing after the creation.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.420]   And when we chase after the creation, there comes covening, there comes slander, there
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.340]   comes murder.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:45.740]   All the other sins come as a result of forsaking the ultimate object of our worship.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:54.080]   Whatever causes us to give defective worship is an open door to all kinds of temptations.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.020]   We cannot give true worship on our terms.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:04.100]   We do not come and reconcile by our terms and by whatever is the most convenient for
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   us.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.300]   But here's the second part.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.380]   Abel's sacrifice left a testimony and speaks to us even to this day.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.380]   It made him righteous.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:19.580]   So we may look at that and say, "Well, maybe because Abel was smart and Abel gave what
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.060]   was best and he worked harder than Cain."
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.060]   That's not what he's pointing to.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:31.220]   He says it made him righteous and it gave him a testimony which still speaks to us today.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:38.260]   So what is it about that that points to speaking to us today and furthermore?
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.420]   It's pretty clear.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.820]   Now we know that animal sacrifice, like there is no mention of that in Genesis chapter 3,
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.260]   saying like this is the only way of atonement.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.180]   But in Genesis chapter 3, we have what's called the proto-evangelium, which translation means
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.300]   first gospel.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:02.140]   As soon as they fall, God has a plan that the serpent is going to bruise the heel of
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.860]   the woman's seed and the seed is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.660]   And that's the description of how Jesus is going to come and he's going to overpower
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.700]   the accuser.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.940]   Now that's not explained, but when we know what's going on in the New Testament, we look
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.760]   back at that and say clearly he left evidence of that.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:25.060]   And so when we get to chapter 4, he says Abel gives blood sacrifice, which is acceptable
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.140]   to him.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.340]   It doesn't describe for us how much they understood what was going on.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.740]   Even though we started through the book of Leviticus, Leviticus, all the offerings that
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.380]   were given in the book of Leviticus was not the first time they did that.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.020]   You see it in Deuteronomy, you see it in Exodus, you see it all over Genesis, and you see it
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:51.420]   as early as Genesis chapter 4, that there was an understanding that is not explained
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   to us.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.380]   There was an understanding that blood sacrifice was necessary.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.100]   And so when Abel gave his offering, not only was it the best, not only did he follow the
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:08.500]   prescription, his blood sacrifice pointed to something that was coming.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   And clearly we, you and I know what that is.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:17.180]   In Hebrews chapter 9, 22, in Leviticus 17, 11 it says, "Without the shedding of blood,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.260]   there is no forgiveness of sins."
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.860]   The only way that even with our best effort that we can reconcile with this God is through
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.940]   the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.580]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 24, "And to Jesus, the medium of our new covenant, and to the
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:38.220]   sprinkled blood which speaks better than the blood of Abel."
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:44.540]   Abel was just a precursor, a foreshadow of what he was going to do to reconcile people
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.900]   to himself.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:54.740]   So right off the bat, in Genesis chapter 3 and chapter 4, God is foreshadowing a way
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.460]   for sinners to be reconciled to him from the get-go.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.940]   So the gospel is not introduced to us in John 3, 16.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.980]   The good news was embedded according to Ephesians when?
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.700]   Before even the creation of the world, before you and I could even understand.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:17.720]   Even before this event, God had plans to reconcile sinners to himself.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:24.860]   So chapter 4 is describing to us, or verse 4 in this passage is describing to us, a way
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.660]   for mankind to reestablish the worship.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:36.820]   Because it is only when we become true worshipers of God, we truly live.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.660]   So many people interpret John chapter 10, verse 10, when Jesus says, "I have come to
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.700]   give life and to give this life abundantly."
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.380]   And they wonder why, "If God came to give me life abundantly, how come I'm having such
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.740]   a hard time paying bills?
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.580]   How come I have such a hard time with my family?
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.500]   How come I have such a hard time to getting promoted at work because he said he's going
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.820]   to make my life abundant?"
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.140]   But the abundant life that he's referring to is not an abundant life here.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:11.260]   It's only life that you can have when you are reconnected with the author of life.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.380]   And only when you're reconnected with the author of life.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:20.780]   So the greater of a fan, greater of a worship that we are of him, the more we experience
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.780]   this life.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:29.380]   I don't know about you, but the happiest people that I know in this world are people who are
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.220]   crazy about Jesus.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.380]   Most to the point like, "Hey, calm down.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.780]   Calm down.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.860]   Our worship's at 11.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.540]   You don't need to show up at 10 o'clock.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.340]   Calm down."
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.420]   Every new Bible comes out, they got to get the new one.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.180]   They got to get to every conference.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.700]   They're at every single conference.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   They're always at the front.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.540]   They're always singing the loudest.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.140]   Calm down.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.020]   And there's a joy that exuberates that comes from them that is not fake.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.520]   You can't fake that.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.940]   You can get fans to show up on time if you are A students.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:07.380]   You can get fans to open up the Bible, attend Bible study, and be responsible and become
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:13.500]   good citizens and attend, do this, and do everything that's expected.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:21.340]   But a fanatic, fanatic of Christ is not something that you and I create.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.940]   That's something that happens because we encounter this God.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.980]   See, the Apostle Paul was a fanatic.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.460]   He didn't become who he was because Jesus spent a lot of time with him, telling him
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.180]   right and wrong and telling him the good word.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.300]   No, he encountered the glory of Christ.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.140]   And it became rubbish.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.220]   He wasn't discipled to think rubbish.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.460]   It became rubbish.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.980]   And from that point on, he was willing even to give his life to tell other people about
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.620]   this, because whatever comes after this, meeting Christ, is way better than whatever it was
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.740]   that he was pursuing.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:07.420]   See, he's calling us to be fanatics, to come deeper.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.740]   And that's why he says the door has opened.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.220]   He says, "Come to the throne of grace with confidence," because the whole purpose of
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.180]   salvation is in that statement.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.100]   The whole purpose of salvation is in, "Now you're no longer condemned.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.100]   Do whatever you want."
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.260]   That's not the gospel.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.740]   The gospel is because of what he has done.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.020]   The door has been opened.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.620]   "Now come.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.460]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, so I can give you rest.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.980]   Come to the throne of grace with confidence."
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.380]   That's the good news of the gospel, that the door to life has been opened.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.020]   "Now come."
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:52.100]   Not to simply admire it, not to simply write about it, not to simply take pictures and
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.380]   put it on the wall, but to come.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:03.980]   Because true life is found in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:09.300]   That's what Cain and Abel's offering was pointed to, that speaks to us to this day.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.860]   Hebrews 9, 13-14, "For if the blood of goats and bulls and ashes of hypher, sprinkling
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:19.260]   those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, how much more
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.740]   will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.700]   to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.460]   How much more?
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.540]   And then finally, 1 Peter 1, 18-20, "Knowing that you are not redeemed with the perishable
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:40.100]   things like silver or gold from your feudal way of life, inherited from your forefathers,
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:47.980]   but with the precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:53.660]   You know, it almost seems like a contradiction or an oxymoron to say that the way of life
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:59.500]   is Abel's offering, because Abel died.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   Cain was the one who murdered, and he lived.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.340]   He got to live long life.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.580]   Abel gave the right offering, and he died.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.980]   So how can you say that this leads to life?
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:20.160]   From a worldly perspective, if all we know is here, then what a tragedy.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.900]   The guy who was right before God, the guy who gave his best, the guy who gave the blood
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.940]   sacrifice, he's the one who ended his life early.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.220]   When we see it from a man's perspective.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:38.740]   But from God's perspective, from an eternal perspective, we can say that Abel died with
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.420]   life.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.940]   Cain lived in death.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.780]   Living a long life.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:53.220]   There's a lot of people who don't want to be here, because that's their personal testimony.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.500]   Living a long life is not a blessing in and of itself.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.940]   Existing in this fallen world with all the depravity, with all the chaos, with all the
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.580]   hurts, with all the families that are broken up, with all the past pains that they have
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:13.500]   to live with, living a long life is not a blessing in and of itself.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.900]   God did not call us so that we can live long.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.740]   God called us so that we can live, truly live.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.700]   Zoe in him.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:29.300]   And the only path that causes us to do that is the path of Abel.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:36.220]   By faith, he offered up a better sacrifice, which caused him to be righteous.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.420]   And this righteousness and the blood sacrifice and right worship of Abel speaks to us even
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.940]   to this day, even when we die.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.260]   That's the gospel message.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:56.860]   So as we look at the other people in Hebrews chapter 11, if we miss this point, you may
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.500]   study the book of Hebrews and say, "Oh, if I just believed, if I had more faith, I can
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   conquer enemies and I can do all this."
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.420]   And you will miss the whole point.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:10.440]   Because the point of this, there's the first part of it, what will teach us that God used
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.500]   them and delivered them and did all of this stuff.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.540]   And then the second part will come out, but some of these people died early, were tortured,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:22.420]   were beaten, but all of it did it because they believed.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:27.300]   They believed that life was in God, that promised land was not a physical land, but a land that
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.260]   he will bring.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.700]   So I pray that as we look at this foundation, that that would embed into our hearts.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.940]   And again, and I'm going to say this over and over again, as I've always been saying,
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:45.620]   and his point is the same, fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.620]   faith.
