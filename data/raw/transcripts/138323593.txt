[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [audio cuts out]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   been faithful in their life and preaching the gospel to them, bringing them to church,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   and how God has used them to bring them to the faith. And we
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   stopped doing that a while back because it was just getting too long. You know, so
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   we had so many people and so many people praying, and so for the purpose
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   of to be able to do all this in the same time, we stopped
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   doing that. But nevertheless, that was a really important time to recognize
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   all the people who have labored in their lives. And I know that each one of the
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   people who are being baptized today, that many of you have encouraged
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   them, shared with them. Some of you directly was able to share the gospel with them.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And again, I can testify for myself with
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   my children that there's a lot of people, even in this room,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   that share the gospel with my two boys who are being baptized today. And I remember
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   even when they were little, little kids, you know, like in Sunday school,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   literally the Sunday school was them, and then a few of my nephews,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and that was usually the Sunday school. And those of you who taught Sunday school at that
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   time, you know, and I know that you guys share the gospel with them, and the
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   youth group, youth teachers, and pastors who have been faithful in their lives.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And so again, I'm very thankful that the room is filled with people who labor.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Again, not only in my children's lives, but every single person that's here,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   that God uses the body of Christ in different ways. Sometimes you don't
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   even know how you're being used. Sometimes you'll hear in their testimony how
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   you welcome them into the church, and how that kind of opened the door
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   for them to hear the gospel message. And it may mean nothing
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   at that time, but how God uses different gifts and different people in their lives
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   to be able to get them to this point where they're able to make a public profession.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And so again, we want to thank all of you for laboring. And again,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I hope that, and I know that their testimony will be a blessing to you.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I wanted to just briefly share as a reminder about what the baptism
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   is and what it is not. And then I'm going to give the rest of the time so that you can
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   hear their testimonies. Baptism, in and of itself,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   has no power. So just because you're baptized
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   or you're not baptized, it doesn't affect your salvation in any particular way.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Because baptism, in and of itself, there's no power in those
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   waters where you go in and you're washed, and you come out and all of a sudden you're clean.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's like marriage. Marriage ceremony, the ceremony
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   itself is just what you do on the outside. But the ceremony in and of itself
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   has no power. People get married on television all the time, but
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   they're just playing. They don't make a movie and a show and they dress
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   up and then they pretend like they get married and they say, "Oh, you're married now because you went through the
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   ceremony." Ceremony is an outward expression of what is
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   actually taking place inside. And so the real power
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   behind what's happening is what God has been doing in their life. And so the baptism
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   ceremony is just a public expression of what the power
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of the gospel has been doing in their lives, either at a point or
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   through a series of time. So, what is
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   baptism then? Baptism, the word in and of itself means
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   to immerse. "Baptizo," it was not a uniquely Christian word.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It was a word that was described in the Greek culture when somebody
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   decided to convert. So, if somebody wanted to go into
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   public office, they would have a baptism ceremony, meaning that they're going to
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   put aside their private life in order to serve the country in a particular
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   way. And so, the word itself means
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   to be immersed in something, to change from one to another.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And so the significance behind the baptism is, again,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   that each one of them, as they're being baptized, they're making a public profession
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   that because of their union with Christ, their old life is being put away,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   and that they're, again, being united with Christ in His new life.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Well, you might just say, "Well, if that's the case, if it's just a
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   public ceremony, and the real power is already what's been taking place inside,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   what's the point of the ritual? Why is this so important?"
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Well, we know that in the Bible it's important because before Christ
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   came He sent a messenger six months ahead of Him to prepare the way.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Baptism was such an important part of His ministry that they actually called Him
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   John the Baptist. That's just like some of you guys saying
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   David the boba lover, or Eric the Jeremy Lin fan,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   or whatever it is that describes who you are. So, John
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the Baptist, His ministry was so,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   the baptism was such an integral part of His ministry that
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   they actually called Him John the Baptist. And so, John
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   the Baptist in His preaching, His primary preaching meaning was, "Repent for the kingdom
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   of heaven is at hand." And so when people would come to Him saying, "I want to receive
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Christ," or "I want to be renewed," His
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   teaching to them was, "Come and repent and be baptized." And baptism
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   meaning to put away your old life and to receive Christ
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   in repentance. So, the real meaning behind the
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   baptism is this, is to repent. It's to repent of our sins,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   to be forgiven. And Romans chapter 6,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   3-4 it says, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?"
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   To be baptized into His death. So when they go into the water, I'm going to ask them the question,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   "Do you understand that when you go in you're uniting with Christ in His death?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And when you come out you are uniting with Christ in His resurrection.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But what does it mean to be baptized into His death?"
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   As I said, the word "baptized" means to be immersed.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So, literally, to be baptized means to be immersed,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   to be consumed along with His death.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   In Isaiah 53, 4-6, "Surely He has been born of our grief
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed Him stricken,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   smitten by God and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He was crushed for our iniquities. Upon Him was the chastisement that brought
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   us peace, and with His stripes we are healed.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   All we like sheep have gone astray; we all have turned, every one of us, our own way.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all."
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So to be united with Christ isn't simply that, "You know what, there's some sins
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   that I need to get rid of, and so I'm going to come and I confess that sometimes
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I lie, sometimes I do this." Just as the word
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   "baptism" means, it means to be completely consumed and immersed.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   There is no partial regeneration. There is no partial
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   acceptance. To be immersed into
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   His death means that every part of us, everything that we know of us
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   is united with Him in His death. So we are consumed in
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   His death. We're absolutely overpowered by His death.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That's what that word means, to be baptized into His death. So that's why
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   when we have our baptism, the person going into the water,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   the actual ritual is burial. That's what that
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   water signifies. That when they go in, if they go in and a part of their head
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   is sticking out of the water, we'll make sure that all of it is under the water.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   We'll make sure. Make sure that when that individual comes out,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   there's not a dry part of his body. There's not a single strand that hasn't
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   been wet. Because that's the meaning of baptism, into His death, to be completely
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   consumed and immersed. And that's why a Christian
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   is described in 2 Corinthians 5.17, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   He is a new creation. Completely new. You're not a better version
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   of the old. You're not, you know, Jeremy 2.0 or
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   2.6 or 5S or 6.6S or whatever, right?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   You're a completely new creation. He says the old has passed away, completely
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   gone. Behold, the new has come. And that's what the baptism
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   signifies. That we are surrendering our life to Christ and
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   He gives us a completely new life. We put on the new,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   newness of Christ. But not only are we consumed in His death,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the Bible says we are also united with Him in His death, in order
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   that we may be united with Him in His resurrection.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's not just about the death. It's about the new life, to be
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   reborn. In 1 Corinthians 15.54, it says
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   death is swallowed up in victory. Oh death, where
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   is your victory? Oh death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The power of sin is in the law. When
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   the individual comes out of the water, it signifies the same
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   resurrection of Christ. That as He was resurrected, and that same power that
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   resurrected Him will resurrect up because our sins were consumed
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   in His death. When a Christian dies, you know, there's
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   no individual who actually looks forward to death, the physical aspect
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   of it. But every Christian who has been born again, has been
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   united with Christ in His resurrection, it is in death, physical death
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   that we will really live. That we will put away this fleshy body
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that keeps us away from being with the Lord. And so,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   when a Christian passes from this life, this physical life to the next, it says
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that we will be united with Christ permanently and eternally.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So, I remember when my father was passing away, you know, I've been
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   as a pastor I've been in the bedside of individuals who were
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   passing away. I've attended many funerals. But I remember my father as
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   he was passing away, it wasn't sudden, it took a long time. And I remember that process
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that the longer my father, or the more that my father
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   knew that the time was coming, the more he seemed like he was looking forward to it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   So, he lived his life laboring as a pastor,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and gone through the ups and downs of life of being a servant
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   of Jesus Christ. And I remember at the end of his life, he was leaving
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   in peace because he wasn't going into eternity that
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   was mysterious. You know, obviously it would be first for him, but he
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   looked like he was eagerly anticipating, it's time for me to go and I need to go.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And so, when he passed, of course it was sad for us that we were going to physically miss him.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But there's also a joy that's in us because we know that he's with our Savior.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So, in the resurrection, not only is this the resurrection of our physical
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   flesh, but it reminds us of the hope that every single
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   one of us has. That death has been consumed in victory
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   in Jesus Christ. And that's what this baptism ceremony really is. That every
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   single person who has this hope in Jesus Christ, because of our sins being
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   washed away, there is no barrier between us and God. And therefore, when we die,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   we will be in his presence. And we can literally enter the throne
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   of grace with confidence. And so, we encourage all of you,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   again, as Christians, as we hear their testimony, it's a reminder to us that this
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   is why we worship God. This is why we surrender and give our life to
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   him. For those of you who are here as our guests, again, we want to
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   encourage you that, again, whether you believe this or not, this is at
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   the essence of what Christianity is. That Christians are supposed to be nice,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   they're supposed to take care of the poor, and all of these things are things that the Scripture teaches
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   us. But at the core of Christianity, why Jesus came,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   he says he has come to set the captives free. To set us free from
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   our sins. And to forgive our sins. And he made an
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   invitation years ago, that if you confess your sins, that he
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   will be faithful and just. And he is compassionate and loving.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That he will forgive you of your sins. As long as we acknowledge that we
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   are sinners, as long as we acknowledge that he is the answer to our sins, he says he
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   will forgive us. So, again, if you are here as a guest, hearing the Gospel for the
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   first time, we encourage you that maybe at this moment you are
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   not a believer. Maybe you are just kind of, is he? Is he real? Is he not real?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, the best way to find out is ask him. You don't need to
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   come to a ritual. There is no special ceremony that you need to be a part of.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   If God is real, just close your eyes and say, "God, if you are real, would you open my eyes
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and allow me to see if this is real or not?"
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And again, we want to encourage you, if you have any questions, we are more than
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   willing to stay and answer questions. You can email us and we will try to do that.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   But again, for all of us, we ask that as you pay attention to the testimony,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   don't just listen to it like, "Oh, that's great. That's happening to them." Every single
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   thing that they say, every Christian should be able to relate to. And I pray that
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   as you are listening, that you may be encouraged and to be reminded again
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   of the grace that all of us are under. So, at this time, we are going to
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   begin with our brother, Mark. And he is going to come and give his testimony. Let's welcome him.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   [Applause]
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So, I'm Mark Van Riper. I'm the child of a
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Protestant father and a Jewish mother who decided that it would be
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   best to raise me in the Presbyterian Church, where I was baptized
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   early in my elementary education. It was not much later after that
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   that I began to grow a dislike for the Church and for Christians in general. This was
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   due to a combination of bad experiences with Sunday school teachers,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   my own thin-skinned nature, and my own feelings
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   that I never really fit in. So, slowly I began with my
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   withdrawal from the Church. And during this hiatus,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   I never really lost my faith in God. Well,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I don't know if I really had one, but my understanding of Him was more
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   akin to Santa Claus. So, up through my high school education,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   it was basically, I just tried not to do bad things so that God wouldn't
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   punish me. During the fall of my sophomore year in high school, I
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   tore my ACL in my knee, which
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   required me to have surgery and effectively ended my
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   hopes of any athletic greatness that every high school
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   kid dreams of. During my recovery
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   from the surgery, I began to feel more out of place and withdrawn than I
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   usually experienced. So, this magnified my inner monologue that
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I, again, did not fit in or belong. So, I began to spend a great
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   deal of time contemplating my life and my belief
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   system. During a particularly deep period of depression, I remember stepping outside
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   of my room on the second floor of the house and looking down at my father
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   who was in the living room. While I was dealing with my own personal
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   problems, my father was dealing with unemployment
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   and an upcoming eviction from our home. As I looked down
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   the stairs at my father while he was doing his daily devotionals,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   a feeling of peace came upon the house that was palpable.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And it was this moment that I saw the
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   peace that my dad had experienced in this. And
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I then knew what I wanted and what I needed in my life. I began
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   attending church more often with the juvenile understanding that true worship of
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Christ involved self-deprecation and groveling
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   in shame before him. Shortly after my return to church, I began to get involved
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   with the youth ministry at my mother's strong urging.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And it was there I met a youth pastor
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   named Bill who was a young seminary student at the time.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He encouraged me to dive into the scriptures and grow
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   my knowledge of God through that. And so I began reading the scriptures
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and reading the writings of C.S. Lewis with a hunger that seemed to
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   grow with each verse and each line I read.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It was in this time of growth that I began to understand that
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Christ was a gracious God who is worshipped through love,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   compassion, and self-sacrifice. That he did not come to die on the cross
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   to give me guilt, but to free me from it.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   This new God I had never known or seemed to
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   understand. It was so unbelievable to me that all I wanted
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   was to know Christ more. And with this knowledge I was able to find peace with my
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   feelings of exclusion, understanding that I was an alien of this world
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and that my citizenship lies in heaven. This understanding released me from
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   the anger that I felt from always being an outcast because
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I knew I belonged to an eternal family that would always accept me.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And with this foundation I've been able to grow in my understanding of Christ even more
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and find that peace, understanding that all trials I face
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   are not punishment, but
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   like iron through a forge, they are an opportunity to be purified and strengthened
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   in Christ. So I continue to seek to know Christ and the power
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   of his resurrection, that I may help others to find the peace
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   that transcends all understanding and help them to see the Savior
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   who gives me the peace and wisdom in abundance. So, thank you.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   [applause]
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Mark, do you understand when you go into the water you're uniting with Christ in his death and when you come out you're uniting
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   with Christ in his resurrection? Yes, sir. I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   [applause]
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   My name's Liana. I'm currently an upcoming fourth-year at UCI.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I grew up in the church, but I was normally the kid who went with the
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   flow and didn't really understand what I was learning and didn't really see the
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   importance of it. I would go to church usually intending to play with
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   my friends and pass time. Also growing up I had a different
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   mindset than other kids my age. By blood, my dad
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   was my dad, but relationally I considered my
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   grandpa like a dad. After my parents suffered a miscarriage, I was
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   cast aside to my grandparents at age three to raise me
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   while they coped by busying themselves with work. Because of that, I
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   hadn't seen my parents often when I was younger. My grandfather
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   was a firm believer, and I witnessed to the strength of his faith daily through his
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   diligence in reading the Bible and praying every chance he had.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   My church experienced a split, and suddenly I found myself
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   being forced to leave my friends and attend another church. In my head, I thought,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   "Great, I have to find new friends," while my parents no longer felt obligated to go to
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   church. Still, my grandpa persistently attended without
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   complaint, even going as far as taking the bus by himself when there was no one to give him
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   a ride. By the time I was in middle school, my grandpa had been diagnosed
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   with prostate cancer in his late 70s, which resulted in him
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   receiving surgery. Despite my fears, things seemingly
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   went back to normal until he had recovered from his surgery. It wasn't
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   until four years later that we found out that his cancer had come back and
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   spread to bone marrow cancer. He was being treated at home with nurses
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   coming in and out of my house, and his lack of strength had prevented him from
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   physically attending church, but it did not hinder his faith, as he still spent a majority of
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   his time praying and reading the Bible. At the time, I would
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   have to come straight home after school to take care of my grandpa while my parents worked
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and my sisters were at school. It wasn't until one day when I was
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   handling his IV that he told me about how his faith changed his life.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   From then, I was convicted to take Christianity seriously, but what I didn't
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   realize was that it was also conditioning me. I had believed that
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   as long as I paid attention in church, I would keep my grandpa's pain away,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   allowing him to stay alive. I was 18 years old at that time.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   In the beginning of my freshman year of college, I hit the lowest
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   point in my darkest time that I ever had in my very short life.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Certain circumstances have left me dangerously unhappy and only got worse.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   On October 26, 2012, I had found out that my grandpa
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   had passed away. The day before
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   my grandpa had passed, I had selfishly chosen to stay in Irvine rather than go home
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   so I could hang out with my friends.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It wasn't until later that I found out my grandpa had been asking for me.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I felt hurt and angry, especially towards God, and I blamed myself.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I had prayed every day for healing, only to feel like my grandpa
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   was taken away from me without giving me a chance to say goodbye.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I thought that even my grandpa, the biggest believer I knew, was robbed
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   of his last moments. My hurt and anger fixed towards the belief that I had
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   in Christ and hardened my heart until I refused to have anything to do regarding
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   the church or my superficial faith. My anger continued on for
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   a year and a half, and I led myself down a destructive and dark path
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   to the point where I felt lost and lonely no matter where I was. I surrounded myself
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   with friends, thinking I could fill the emptiness I had inside of me. My grades
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   slipped, my social life took a dive, and my relationship with my family was hanging on by a thread.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   This cycle stopped when a close friend introduced me to
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   a campus ministry called CCM. At first, I had gone for social
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   intentions, but ended up inevitably listening to the messages.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   I remember standing for midterms when my thoughts unexpectedly recalled
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   the messages that I had heard. Suddenly, I broke down in tears as my heart opened up
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   and I realized that God hadn't taken my grandpa away from me, but showed
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   his mercy and grace by taking his pain away instead. It was then
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   that I realized that my grandpa had spent his entire life trusting God
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   until the end of his days while I opened my eyes to the fact that God had a plan for me.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I prayed that I would find joy in things and I appreciate
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   what I had rather than focus on what I had lost. I prayed that I would find
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   my way. I also felt guilt for the built-up anger that I had for a year and a half
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and for the sins that I had committed during that time. Above all,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I had pleaded that God would forgive me for my foolishness, selfishness, and sinful heart.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   The burdens of my sins were heavy on my conscience, paired with the regret of my actions,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   and I was desperate for a second chance. I wanted to make myself
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   a new person, as told in Colossians 3, and prove
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   myself different. After opening up my heart and after a few months of
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   attending Berean, I had accepted Christ and my lifestyle had changed completely.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   My priorities were different. I prayed genuine prayers. I consistently
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   did my devils for the first time and I made the choice to become a member.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Also, whereas previously I would have seen it as unnecessary, now I'm taking
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   the next step in my growth and getting baptized.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I still feel sad and occasionally scared that my grandpa is physically absent,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   but the words of Isaiah 41.10 calmed my fears
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   and anxiety and gave me strength to pursue a life with Christ.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   While I was previously walking lost in the dark, I am now walking in Christ.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   [applause]
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   [applause]
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   [applause]
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You understand you're going into the water, you're united with Christ in His death.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   When you're coming out, you're united with Christ in His resurrected life.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   [applause]
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   [applause]
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   [applause]
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   [applause]
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   [applause]
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Hi.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I'm Jeremy and this is my testimony.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I know probably most of you guys know that I pretty much grew up here.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   I was born into this church.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Sorry, I'm nervous. But yeah, I went to this church my whole life.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I grew up in the church. I learned all the stories.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I learned the Bible pretty well just going to church every Sunday,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   my parents being devout Christians. But I don't think I ever really
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   thought about or comprehended what I actually believed in
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   probably until like my, until seventh grade. In seventh grade
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   we moved to a different house and instead of going to a different school
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   we decided that we would try to, one year of homeschooling.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   So my seventh grade year we were homeschooled and it sucked.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   [laughter]
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I really hated it. I got pulled out of school.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I was away from all my friends and I was at home alone
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   all the time. I had no social life.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   This is around the time where I started puberty.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Emotionally I was very
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   all over the place and I think I got pretty rebellious
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   against my parents. So yeah, I just had a lot of
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   emotional stress during that time. I ended up spending a lot of time
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   in my room just feeling really lonely and bitter.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I guess that gave me a lot of time to just reflect
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   upon my life. I guess that's when I really started to question what I believed in.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   After all those years of hearing the gospel just like so many times
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I think it finally started to make sense to me during that time.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I was finally able to just think about what the gospel meant to me
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   and I was able to accept that. I finally
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   understood and was able to realize that
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I'm a sinner and that I deserve to be judged by God but
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   God showed mercy upon me and he gave me the opportunity to receive salvation.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So I mean, yeah, during that time
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   I was able to accept Christ. I don't know exactly when I did but it was in that
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   time, my seventh grade year. So I
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   gave my life to Christ. I repented and I truly believe
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   that God forgave me of my sins and that I have
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   hope in a future, in a place
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   in heaven. Since then there's been a lot of
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   times, there's been a lot of dry patches, times where I've felt really
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   distant from God but I look back at all the times that
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I've drifted away from God and God's always brought me back to him. I have complete
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   faith that God was with me in all those times and that's such a good
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   reminder to me that God will be with me in the future.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I know things are just going to get harder.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   There will be a lot more harder obstacles in my way in the future but I know
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and I have complete trust that God will take care of me and
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   yeah, that's my testimony.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   [applause]
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   [applause]
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   [applause]
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And I understand when you go into the water that you're united with
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Christ in his death and when you come out you're united with Christ.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.920]   (audience applause and cheers)
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.780]   (audience applause and cheers)
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   (audience applause and cheers)
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:31.260]   - My name is Annette Revelo.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.920]   I'm a fourth year at UCI.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.580]   In the earlier years of my life,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.700]   I grew up in the Seventh-day Adventist church.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.660]   I liked it, but I was too young to truly understand
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.540]   what it meant to follow Christ.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.500]   I came because family took my sister and I,
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.260]   and I'm grateful for my aunt, my dad,
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.140]   and everyone else that took me to church
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.400]   practically every Saturday morning.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.080]   I won't forget those early morning biscuits
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.140]   my aunt would make, the omelet, the soy milk,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.380]   which were, let's face it, my primary motivators
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.460]   to attend Sabbath school every morning.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.880]   As I grew older, I felt distant from God,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.200]   although I knew this in the back of my mind.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.000]   I was always motivated by someone else to see God,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.740]   whether it be family, friends.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.620]   It wasn't something that came to me
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.980]   as something truly important.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.080]   Being inspired by my cousin as she took me
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.060]   to young adult Bible studies right after I graduated
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.220]   high school, a part of me wanted to get closer to God
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.180]   during my college years.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.260]   Therefore, right when I started college,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.580]   I tried to find a church of fellowship.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.580]   In addition, I started my job as a freshman.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.220]   In short, I put a lot on my plate
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   and didn't even let myself properly transition to college.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.620]   I felt overwhelmed, and sadly to me,
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.980]   the main purpose of fellowship was to make friends
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.700]   and not seek God.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.220]   Although I came to church, it was not consistent,
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.380]   and it didn't come out out of love for God,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.940]   but to have the feeling of doing the right thing.
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.620]   I also tried to read the Bible,
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.480]   but not in a way that was in depth.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.060]   You would think I was doing the right thing,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.340]   but I'm making progress with my faith
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.620]   because I was at least trying, but it was the opposite.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.300]   I progressed backwards, falling into sin
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   by not valuing my time with God and compromising my purity.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.820]   The sin drew me away from God, from church, from friends.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.620]   Although I would try and come to church,
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.080]   the gospel would not reach me deeply,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200]   and I would feel discouraged to come back the next week.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:44.980]   Then, two weeks later, two years later, God broke me.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.740]   He made me realize how true his words are
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.660]   by how fallen our society has become and will continue to be.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.060]   I was just spiritually awakened by the signs of the times,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.780]   but this awakening left me scared,
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.600]   left me doubting my salvation.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.460]   I believed in Christ, but did I live the life of a believer?
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.400]   This not only left me scared for myself, but my family.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.920]   Therefore, I also tried to warn them
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   from what I thought came out of love,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.960]   but what I didn't realize was that it was out of fear.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.160]   I knew it was not enough to believe.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.840]   I knew that I couldn't face this myself,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   and I needed the help of a church to build up my faith.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.640]   I re-listened to one of Pastor Peter's sermons online
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.860]   called To Be a Man After God's Own Heart.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.720]   I felt convicted after and realized
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.440]   that I had been a fan of Jesus,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.120]   had I been a fan of Jesus all my life.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.820]   I knew that Jesus Christ was the only way
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.880]   to salvation, but did I truly know what that meant?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.480]   Surely enough, God is faithful,
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.920]   God's timing is always right.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.680]   Before returning to church on Sunday,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   I sought to talk to a pastor for the convictions I felt.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.240]   Therefore, I tried to attend
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.140]   Berrien's College Bible Study one Friday night.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:18.260]   Praise the Lord, because a new Bible study session
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.040]   was just starting for the summer that same week.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   I knew I had to repent, but how did I know if I was saved?
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.080]   I asked Pastor Mark this, and he asked me
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.400]   a very simple question, did I reconcile with God?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.480]   He broke it down for me that same night,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   and when I came home, I kneeled and prayed
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.880]   for forgiveness of my sins and accepted Jesus Christ
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.600]   as my Lord and saver.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   I felt broken inside and so small like a child
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.460]   and desperately wanted him.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.540]   It was an amazing feeling.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.100]   When I felt all the sin, confusion, doubt, and fear,
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.660]   I knew there was no better way to meet Christ
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.660]   than reading the gospel.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.580]   For the first time, I came to understand
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.060]   what it meant to live a life of faith,
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.340]   because Christ did it himself.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.100]   For the first time, I understood the importance
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.980]   of loving our neighbors, how powerful our God is,
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.220]   and I understood that we must slowly die to ourselves.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.780]   Last, I came to really understand and truly appreciate
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.820]   the love Jesus Christ had for us when he died
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.180]   on the cross to pay for all our sins
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.720]   by reading the gospel and taking BCC.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.140]   God really took all my anxiety and my doubt
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.620]   and has made me really depend on him through his word.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.100]   I really hope and pray that I won't drift away,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.580]   but by becoming baptized and one with Christ,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.980]   I want to proclaim this love that grows more and more
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.960]   as I seek him by becoming one with my Lord and saver.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.940]   In this, I hope to really turn away from my old life
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.300]   but live a life new, a new focus more
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.040]   on pursuing to glorify God.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.180]   (water trickling)
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:22.420]   - Dianette, do you understand that you're going
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.620]   to the water to be united with Christ in his death
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.180]   and then to return and come out and be united
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.820]   with Christ in his life of resurrection?
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.180]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.380]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.200]   (water trickling)
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:55.940]   - Hello, my name's Zach Kim,
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.460]   and I am gonna be sharing with you guys
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.800]   my testimony today.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.500]   So I grew up in the church my whole life
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.820]   as my dad being the pastor,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.020]   and I never really took my faith seriously
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.500]   until we had a youth group retreat in the eighth grade.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.740]   I don't remember most of the things that,
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.600]   I don't remember a lot of the things that we learned there,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.860]   but one thing that I do remember is
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.240]   the story of the prodigal son.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.140]   I've heard the story dozens of times
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.820]   and I never really understood
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.860]   how beautiful this story really was.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.740]   And one of the pastors that was explaining it
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.340]   at the retreat just explained it in depth
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.900]   and helped me understand that we're all the prodigal son
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.340]   having turned away from our father
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.100]   and how sad God is to see us heading down the wrong path.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.140]   But the pastor explained how in the story
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.940]   the father was looking for his son
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.860]   to return home every moment,
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.980]   and how when he saw his son running,
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.380]   or when he saw his son, he ran to him, embracing him,
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.620]   and welcoming him with open arms.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.460]   And then everyone rejoiced and had a party
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.220]   because the son was once lost and was now found.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.920]   As I heard this true meaning of the story,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.500]   I realized how broken and sorrowful God was
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   to see me heading down, having my back turned towards him.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.240]   Treating him the least of my priorities,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.860]   denying him daily through my life,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   at school, home, or wherever I went,
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.940]   God still showing his love and compassion towards me.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.740]   And at the moment I was so broken,
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.500]   having my eyes open, seeing God for who he truly was,
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.620]   I repented truly for the first time at that retreat,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.980]   truly meaning my repentance and wanting God to be my savior.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.820]   So after that retreat, I came back down from the mountains
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.540]   and slowly I started to go back to my old way of living,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.620]   by cursing at school, cheating, stealing, and so on.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.320]   I would repent over and over, and I thought to myself,
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.540]   forgetting how great God's love is.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.340]   And God can't love me anymore,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.540]   and I thought to myself that God couldn't love me anymore
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.060]   'cause I continued to sin over and over again.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.500]   But I realized just how sinful we really are,
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.460]   and that the grace of God and compassion for us
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.820]   is so much greater than anything we can ever imagine.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.220]   So acknowledging that, being a Christian means
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.140]   that when we sin, we repent of it to God,
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.780]   acknowledging that we can't do anything on our own,
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.020]   and fully relying on him,
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.820]   and that there's no other way to eternal life
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.300]   than through him.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.540]   And again and again, through different times in my life,
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.060]   I realized how great God's love is.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.940]   One thing that just broke me when I realized
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.100]   how much my parents had showed their love for me,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.540]   after getting suspended almost twice from school,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.340]   I realized that day my dad, he forgave me
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.340]   before I even asked for forgiveness.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.900]   And one time how...
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:51.100]   One time how I cursed about my mom to one of my friends,
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:56.100]   how she forgave me before I asked for forgiveness.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.880]   I couldn't understand how much,
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.260]   how they could love me unconditionally.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.700]   And I thought about how God's love
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.300]   is just infinitely much greater
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.640]   than anyone you can ever imagine,
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.060]   anyone in your life,
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.060]   and that he sent his only sign for us to die for our sins
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.660]   so that we could have a chance to be with him in heaven.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.380]   Before I knew Christ, I was lost, but now I'm found.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.620]   I was blind and now I can see.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.860]   I was once without purpose,
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.380]   but now my purpose is to glorify God
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.220]   in all aspects of my life.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.220]   And when I fail, I will continue to get back up
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.780]   knowing that there is something much greater
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.420]   for me and you and for everyone who believes in Christ Jesus,
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.580]   our Lord, which is eternal life with him.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.420]   Thank you.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.580]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:54.060]   - You understand that when you go into the water,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.580]   you're united with Christ in death,
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.860]   and that when you come out, you're united with Christ
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.020]   in his life and resurrection?
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.860]   - Yes.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.020]   - And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son,
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.680]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.240]   (audience applauding)
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.560]   (audience applauding)
