[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Why don't we pray and then we'll get into the Word.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.560]   Lord, we thank you for the freedom to worship you this morning.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.680]   And we thank you for just allowing us to learn and to hear and receive your Word.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.300]   We pray, Father, that as we hear, God, you would, by the power of your Spirit, etch the
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.240]   words into the fabric of our hearts so that we will leave here resembling Jesus a little
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.320]   bit more and shining our light a little bit brighter and being a little bit more salty
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   to the world.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.960]   So we pray for your help for us to be spiritually alert, awake, and sober as we hear your Word.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080]   And would it bear fruit in our lives.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.480]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280]   When I go on a double date with my wife, I'm with a couple who's been married for some
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   time.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.760]   One of the questions that I like to ask is, "What are you like when you get into an argument
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760]   or a fight?"
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.160]   I ask that question because it helps to get to know the people as individuals a little
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.880]   bit better.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.680]   And usually when the answers come, the answer to the question is just usually lighthearted
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.160]   and yet honest.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.920]   And we usually end up having a good chuckle because the stories that are shared are definitely
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.800]   funny and amusing.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.040]   And if you've been married for any length of time, you are fully aware that it's not
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.460]   about if you fight, but rather how you fight that determines the health of your marriage.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.360]   So answers to the question, "What are you like when you get into an argument or a fight?"
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.720]   They vary from person to person.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   You have your yellers.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.000]   Like, "Rawr, how dare you?"
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.780]   You have your yellers.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840]   You have your passive aggressive powders who say, "Fine."
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.420]   And who kind of, "You're not fine at all."
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.680]   You have those who quietly just seethe and shut down on you.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.760]   You have people who storm out of the room.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   You have people who walk out of the room.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.160]   You have others who go out for a jog.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   And I'm sure you and I know people in our workplaces, our schools, and members of our
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.840]   family who deal with conflict in varying other ways.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.000]   Some people try and escape, whether it be through entertainment or even shopping sprees.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.740]   Some people react when they're aroused to profanity-laced tirades.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.960]   Some slander or gossip whoever has offended them.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.480]   Some get drunk.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.360]   Some binge eat.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.200]   And some even physically attack whoever is angering or upsetting them.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.360]   I want to pose a question pertaining to the relationship between anger and our circumstances.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840]   So here's the question.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.680]   Do negative circumstances cause anger or do they simply expose the anger that already
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.120]   resides underneath the surface?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.440]   Again, do negative circumstances cause anger or do they simply expose the anger that already
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.520]   resides underneath the surface?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.920]   In other words, are you and I emotionally neutral until something stimulates or arouses
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   that anger?
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.360]   Or is anger already there, laying dormant in our hearts?
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.940]   And the negative situations simply give our anger an opportunity to expose itself.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.720]   It may very well be a combination of both, but I do like to use the analogy of a sponge
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.440]   when I think of the human heart.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   So human beings are like sponges.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.080]   You don't really see what's on the inside of the heart until you give it a little squeeze.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.240]   I want to draw our attention back to the passage, and it would help you to just keep your Bible
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.600]   open to James chapter 1 because we're going to be jumping in and out of the different
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   verses in that passage, but let's read 1.6 to 22 again.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   And I'm going to read it for you.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.320]   It's up on this slide, but I do encourage you guys to follow along in your Bibles.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.160]   Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.800]   Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.760]   of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.260]   In the exercise of his will, he brought us forth by the word of truth so that we would
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.060]   be a kind of first fruits among his creatures.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.400]   This you know, my beloved brethren, that but everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.640]   and slow to anger, for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.480]   Therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.660]   receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.960]   But prove yourselves doers of the word and not merely hearers who delude themselves.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.440]   And I'm going to read verse 19 to 20 just one more time.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.680]   This you know, my beloved brethren, that but everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.440]   and slow to anger, for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.320]   How is anger expressed in your life?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.080]   And we often think that only those who have explosive tempers have anger issues, but the
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.480]   emotion of anger is expressed by different people in differing ways.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.600]   And oftentimes when we discuss anger in the church, in our Bible studies, in discussions
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.740]   on like interpersonal conflicts when you're counseling, or we talk to people who have
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.960]   anger problems, James 119 is quoted.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.340]   I've seen James 119 on a bumper sticker.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.680]   I've seen it in a frame.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.280]   In fact, one of the parents of the children at our church just told me that she quoted
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.780]   James 119 to her daughter just a couple days ago.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.320]   And I've heard people elaborate on this and say things like, "God gave you two ears and
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.460]   one mouth, so listen twice as much as you speak."
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.560]   And the book of James is often called the Proverbs of the New Testament, and there definitely
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.160]   are things in this epistle that give us insight into how God would desire for his people to
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.400]   live.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:46.080]   But is James 119 a verse that gives wisdom and speaks into our interpersonal relationships?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   Everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger, for the anger of man does
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.520]   not achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.880]   If you look at the context of the verses surrounding James 119, you'll discover that James is not
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   addressing interpersonal relationships here.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.760]   In James 119 to 20, James is addressing the issue of anger that grows in our hearts toward
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.880]   God, especially when we face trials and painful circumstances.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.960]   He is speaking about the anger that wells up in our hearts when we instinctively or
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.920]   innately feel that God is being unfair, unjust, or unkind, or when we do not agree with or
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.080]   understand the way of God in a particular moment or circumstance.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.280]   So in context, the whole book of James, all 108 verses, these are the only two verses
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.080]   that actually discuss the emotion of anger.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.920]   These are the only two.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.720]   So contextually, you want to ask the question, what exactly is James advising here when he
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.560]   tells us to be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger?
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.160]   Because if you want to apply James 119 to human relationships, then the conclusion you
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:15.540]   almost have to draw from verse 20 is, hey, a good handle on your temper can achieve the
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.540]   righteousness of God.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.760]   Are you guys following that logical conclusion?
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.920]   If you apply this to human relationships, you almost have to conclude a good handle
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   on your temper can achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.080]   That is definitely not the case.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   So inasmuch as people have differing ways of expressing their anger when they fight
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.640]   with those closest to them, each of us may have a differing way of expressing our anger
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.520]   towards or discontentment with God.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.040]   So as you guys well know, at the fall, humanity became cursed with an innate hostility and
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.720]   fear towards a creator.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:06.480]   And at birth, every single person enters a world broken, corrupted, and flawed.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:16.060]   And there is in your hearts and there is in mine a natural distrust and fear of God.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.280]   There is a rebellion towards God.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:28.800]   And our perception of right/wrong, just/unjust, is definitely skewed.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:37.160]   And in our fallen and corrupted states, we cannot but see through sin-tainted, sin-colored,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   and self-absorbed lenses.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.040]   We're messed up, okay?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.640]   And we feel anxious.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.960]   So you ever think about Isaiah 55, 9?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.240]   Our children's ministry, actually, they memorize this verse.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.040]   "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.760]   thoughts than your thoughts," says God.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.840]   That's super offensive.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:16.160]   Because God is saying that His wisdom and His ways are not just superior a little bit,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.480]   or just maybe at a little bit of a different level than ours.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:30.640]   What He is saying is, "My ways and my thoughts are infinitely different from yours, and they're
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.160]   much better."
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:41.080]   So that is actually very offensive if you meditate on that in your natural self.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.160]   So though it isn't necessarily unbiblical to say that we need to be quick to listen
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:54.880]   to one another, slow to speak when others are expressing themselves, and slow to anger
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   when we feel that rise.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   That is not James' point here in this passage.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.880]   So what is James' point?
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   James 1:19-20, these two verses are addressing how we as the people of God are to be one,
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.080]   quick to hear from God.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:27.600]   Two, just be slow to speak foolish things in times of weakness about God, such as, "God
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.160]   is tempting me.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.840]   He's at fault.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.040]   He put that guy in front of me.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.240]   He put me in that situation.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.280]   He allowed for this circumstance to happen because His will is perfect.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.600]   It's His fault."
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.080]   That kind of foolish speak, be careful.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.780]   And third, be slow to anger towards God, is what James says.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:12:01.400]   So yes, be quick to hear, but if you just look down two verses later, he says, "Don't
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.920]   just hear, do the Word of God."
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.080]   It doesn't have to do with people.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:13.840]   "Don't just hear the Word of God and be quick to listen to what God has to say, do
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.000]   it," is what it just says in context of this passage.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.760]   So let's explore James 1:19-20 together.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.600]   Some of you guys are like, "Okay, that's not the sermon that I've heard before."
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.040]   So just let's go through this passage together.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.020]   Verse 19 starts with, "This you know, my beloved brethren."
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.040]   So I want to look at what is the "this" that these brethren know.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.240]   Where no word is wasted in Scripture.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   What is the "this" that these brothers know?
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   And I've made a list for you on this next slide.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.260]   One, trials come in all shapes and sizes.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.520]   They produce endurance.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:59.080]   They perfect us as we respond in wisdom, verses 2-8.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:06.320]   And then, trials level the playing field for all people, verses 1, or chapter 1, 9-11.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:15.120]   Whether you're rich or poor, if your child is struck with a disease, you are in complete
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.840]   dependence on a higher being.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:25.200]   If your child has an issue you can't solve, you cannot throw any amount of money at it.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.160]   Trials hurt and level everybody.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.720]   Third, trials though, when we persevere through them, result in blessing, verse 12.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:44.480]   Verses 13-17, God the Father of Lights is both the ordainer of trials and paradoxically,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.000]   and the source of all good things.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.920]   Shoe on that one.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:57.000]   And fifth, God the Father of Lights created us, and his desire for us is to reflect his
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.760]   glory as first fruits.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.920]   This, you know, my beloved brethren.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.100]   So these are truths that you and I also know.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:13.120]   But often in our weakness and in our taintedness, these truths leave us feeling perhaps a little
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.680]   anxious and maybe even a little offended by God.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:25.440]   So we don't quite understand how to reconcile the fact that God is both love and he allows
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.840]   for painful trials and suffering.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.400]   So theologically we trust that God's will is perfect, that he makes no mistakes.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   We theologically trust that God is good, but then when something comes out of nowhere to
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:52.480]   ruin our world, we ask how can he in his goodness and perfection allow us to suffer such heartache
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.760]   and trial.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:04.600]   So he ordains circumstances in our lives that apply a very hard squeeze.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.400]   And it sometimes is only natural that we respond in a degree of anger.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.320]   Let me ask you guys this, is anger a sin?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.760]   You can either shake your heads or not.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   Is anger a sin?
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.440]   Some of you guys are like, no.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.120]   Job responded with a degree of anger when he suffered.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.400]   He just didn't sin in what he said, and he didn't blame God, Job 122.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:40.920]   Jonah the prophet went as far to say twice in Jonah chapter 4, I am angry enough to die,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.580]   he says to God.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:49.200]   And if you actually don't know the context, it's almost comical because I am so mad.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.960]   Isn't this why I fled?
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.080]   Because you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abounding in love.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   So I'm mad.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.720]   It's almost comical, but he is mad at the fact that God is extending an invitation to
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:10.160]   repentance to a wicked people, and his skewed sense of justice has been offended.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.200]   We see that Jesus shows anger.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.120]   So anger is not a sin.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.200]   Ephesians 4.26 says, "Be angry and yet do not sin."
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.920]   NIV, I actually, I like it better.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.840]   It says, "In your anger, do not sin."
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.800]   Because that, so it's out of Psalms chapter 4.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.000]   "In your anger, don't sin."
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.040]   So what is it that we know, brethren?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   Trials come, they're from God, and God is good.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.760]   Profound truths.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:56.240]   Trials come, and they're from God, and God is good.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.400]   What purpose do these trials serve in our lives?
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.520]   We also see the answers to this question in both the immediate context of chapter 1, and
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.840]   then the broader context of James' epistle, and I've listed them for you here.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.600]   The first one is to wean us off of this world.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   To wean us off of this world.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.200]   And it'll say in James 1.25 and in chapter 2, "So that we have liberty."
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.640]   It frees us.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.400]   We are slaves to this world, so when trials come, it weans us off it.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.700]   We get distaste, we get a little bit offended by it, and we experience a little joy of freedom.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.200]   It weans us off this world.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.080]   Second, it's to expose our sin, to discipline, and to humble us.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.960]   Trials expose our sin, they discipline, and they humble us.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.280]   Proverbs 3, 11 to 12 reads, "My son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord, or loathe
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.720]   his reproof.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.960]   For whom the Lord loves, he reproves, even as a father corrects a son in whom he delights."
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.400]   Hebrews also has something similar, chapter 12, verses 9 through 10.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.200]   "Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.080]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.320]   For they disciplined us for a short time, as seemed best to them, but he, God, disciplines
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.280]   for our good, so that we may share in his holiness."
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.800]   And it goes on to say, "Discipline is not pleasant, it's painful.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:36.440]   But they come to expose our sin, to train us, and to humiliate us, sorry, humble us."
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.760]   Different words.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.480]   Why would you squeeze a sponge?
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   Anybody squoze a sponge?
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.880]   Anybody squeeze?
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.280]   Anybody squeeze a sponge before?
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.600]   Why do you squeeze it?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.480]   To see if it squeals?
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   You don't do that.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.760]   Why do you squeeze a sponge?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   So that you clean it.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.480]   And the only way to clean a sponge is to squeeze.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.120]   Would you guys agree with this?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   You have to squeeze it, but dry or wet?
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   Wet.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.920]   To see what's actually on the inside.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.000]   Charles Spurgeon once wrote, "Trials teach us what we are.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.680]   They dig up the soil and let us see what we are made of, and usually it's not good."
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.580]   So trials expose the ugliness and hostility that is hidden deeply in our hearts, and they
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:40.440]   show us that we cannot save ourselves, and that we need saving, because we are utterly
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.240]   self-absorbed, wicked, disgusting.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   Say to your neighbor, "You're disgusting."
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.680]   Actually, don't do that.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:59.000]   We don't like being exposed in our sins, but sometimes the squeezes come, and they shock
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.920]   us when we see what's inside.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:10.640]   Third, trials come to serve as a testimony of God to the world.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.840]   To serve as a testimony of God to the world.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:23.760]   In James 1.18, we read that God's desire was that His people would be a kind of firstfruits
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.920]   among His creatures.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:35.960]   And our innate human anger does not help us to heed the call to be firstfruits.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.320]   So a little bit of context.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.840]   What is a firstfruit?
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.920]   It's all over the Old Testament, but to put it simply, a firstfruit is this, the first
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:51.400]   and very best of offerings to be reserved and presented to God.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.900]   The firstfruits are the first and very best of offerings to be reserved for and presented
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.900]   to God.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.140]   And when Hebrew Jewish men would offer their offerings, a lot of times they had their kids
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.080]   with them, and they would say, "See this?
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.520]   This beautiful, stainless, spotless fruit is devoted to the Lord."
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.160]   And that is what He calls us to be.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.520]   That is our purpose, to be set apart to the pleasure of God.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.240]   Again, which is offensive to us.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   Why do I exist for someone else's pleasure?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.680]   That is innately offensive to us.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.720]   So I said, the third reason is to serve as a testimony of God to the world.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   You guys know this.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:40.880]   The world watches and observes you as you suffer, as you endure.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.840]   So when trials come into our lives, we need to be acutely aware that the world is watching
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.480]   to see how real our faith is and how truly real our God is in our lives.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:02.600]   When persecution, suffering, and death come into your life, the world is observing you
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.400]   to see if you really believe what you say you believe.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:14.480]   That's a humbling truth to meditate on.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.880]   Have you or someone you know been diagnosed with a terminal cancer or some major debilitating
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.920]   disease?
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.280]   The world is watching.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.600]   They're not reading a theology book, they're reading your life.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   But are you raising a child maybe with special needs?
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.520]   The world is watching.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.460]   In the womb, you are told there is a child that might be born with special needs.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.320]   The world is watching.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.960]   Are you facing a major crisis and are you tempted to compromise your principles?
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.160]   The world is watching.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   Are you unfairly treated, persecuted, and hated?
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.720]   Do not fight fire with fire.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:06.200]   It says, again in 1 Peter, don't fight fire with fire because the world is watching.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.160]   Are you having trouble finding a spouse?
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   And this is near and dear to my heart because I'm a single pastor.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.400]   Are you having trouble finding a spouse?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   What is your attitude like about life and about singleness?
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.180]   The world is listening, observing, and watching.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.200]   Are you having trouble getting pregnant?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.840]   Is that all you're thinking about?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.160]   The world is observing you.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.080]   Do you work under or work with very difficult people?
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.600]   Again, they may be provoking you, but they're also watching you.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:52.700]   You are being watched and God wants them to watch you.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:24:00.360]   God wants this blind and decaying world to see the brightness of your light and taste
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.300]   the goodness of those he called to be salt.
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.560]   The world around you is watching and listening to everything you have to say because that's
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:18.900]   their Bible that illustrates what God is like.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:25.240]   Verse 19 to 20, this you know my beloved brethren, but everyone must be quick to hear, slow to
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.520]   speak, slow to anger for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.400]   So then the question, how then are we to respond when we face these trials?
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:44.120]   If anger is an innate emotion, how do we respond when God ordains suffering?
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.840]   What is appropriate?
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   What is sin?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   What is not sin?
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.320]   How do we manage this anger, hence the title, anger management?
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.440]   How do we deal with this?
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.800]   And then verse 21, we get our very first therefore in the book of James.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.920]   And if you guys study any language, the word therefore is important.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   Yes or no?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.360]   You always have to ask, what is this therefore therefore?
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.640]   Why is that there?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.980]   And usually a therefore is a bridge to show a connection between what has just been said
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.320]   to the appropriate application.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.160]   Therefore is a bridge of what has just been said to the expected or appropriate application
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.880]   or conclusion to be drawn.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:36.080]   Therefore, you know all this stuff, therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.760]   remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted which is able to save your
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.960]   souls.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:51.120]   Upprove yourselves, doers of the word and not merely hearers who delude or deceive themselves.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   So this you know.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.620]   You need to be slow to anger.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.520]   So in light of all these things, therefore.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.760]   What's the first therefore and what's the application?
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:11.520]   He says in chapter 1 verse 21, first we are to continue in holy, untainted living.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   I think it's the next slide.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.560]   We are to continue in holy and untainted living.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.320]   The idea of separation from the world of holy undefiled living is brought up several times
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   in chapter 1.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.240]   James actually, chapter 1 ends with 27.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.680]   James 1 27 is often quoted about how the church needs to champion the cause of orphans and
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.580]   widows.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.940]   After all, that is pure religion.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.240]   But many people just stop there.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.840]   The liberal left stops there a lot of times.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:27:04.640]   Yes, pure and undefiled religion is to visit orphans and widows and to be unstained.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.440]   And you have to just, may this sober you up.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:17.140]   We are more likely to respond to trials in our flesh, in our sin, when we are constantly
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.280]   in the habit of indulging the flesh.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:28.900]   We are more likely to respond to the trials in our fleshly reaction when we are constantly
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.840]   in the habit of indulging this flesh.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.900]   So here is an admonition that you can draw from the text.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.800]   The more you befriend the world, later in chapter 4 verse 4 he's going to say that's
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.560]   hostility toward God.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:45.760]   The more you befriend the world, the less you will care about holiness, the less you
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.160]   will care about the Bible, the less you will care about widows, the less you will care
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.420]   about orphans.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.440]   You may find it trendy to get the likes on Facebook, but the less you will care about
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.120]   that from your heart, and the less you will care about the dying world around you, the
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.880]   more you engage the world.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.800]   So for a Christian, God wants to snap you out of that.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   No.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   No.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.120]   No, thank you very much.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.800]   Stop that.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.520]   And he sends a trial to remind us that we are supposed to respond in holiness.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.720]   So when trials come, you are supposed to hunker down and pursue holy living.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   Guard your heart.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   Respond in the ways that the Bible prescribes.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.680]   And remember the more you give your attention to the things of the world, the less you will
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.920]   be able to discern God's will, God's heart, God's voice, and the more susceptible you
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:46.800]   will be to be slow to hear, quick to speak, and quick to anger, the more you indulge the
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   world.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.120]   Secondly, we are to be humble.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.080]   This one's hard.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:02.280]   First of all, this is, the definition of humility is a little bit interesting, but this one
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.880]   is actually hard to apply.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.100]   I want you guys to think about this, okay?
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.880]   This is an important theme all over scripture.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.560]   Is humility important in scripture?
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.960]   Is humility one of the hallmarks of a Christian?
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   Yes.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Is humility required of you?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   Is it commanded of you?
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   Yes.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   How do you obey?
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   Humble.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.840]   Do you chant something?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   Humility.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   Do you chant some magical formula to humble yourselves?
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   Do you beat your breasts?
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.480]   Do you dress in sackcloth?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.440]   How do you try to be humble?
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.720]   This is an important question because it's emphasized not just here in verse 21, but
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   all over the book of James and the Bible.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.640]   In order to answer this question, I'm going to first share with you what humility is not.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   First one, it's not an external show or pretense of piety.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.680]   It's not an external show or pretense of piety.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.440]   Yes, God is good.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.760]   I'm fasting right now to seek God.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.080]   You should seek God too.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   Let's fast together.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.040]   That's not humility.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.920]   In verse 16, Jesus says, "Don't be like the hypocrites.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.040]   When they fast, they're like, 'Oh, I'm starving,' and then they're like looking like they're
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.840]   fasting so it's clear to everybody.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   But wash your face.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.040]   Put oil on your head.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.800]   Don't make it obvious to people that you are fasting before the Lord."
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.560]   So it's not an external show or pretense of piety.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.920]   Second, it is not an inferiority complex or an insecurity.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   You know what these are?
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   It's wounded pride.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.400]   "Oh, so and so is better than me.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.680]   That person is more qualified than me."
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.960]   That's not humility.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.080]   Moses, who was called the most humble man on the planet by God himself at the burning
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:55.680]   bush, was not humble because God doesn't rage against a humble man.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.560]   He rages against an arrogant man.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.680]   And at the burning bush, Moses, Acts 7, 22, Moses was trained up in all the wisdom of
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.040]   Egypt and he was powerful in speech and in action, Stephen said in his speech.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   But you know what happens when you don't use something for 40 years?
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.080]   For 40 years, he was just like, he's just hitting the animals and that's it.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.760]   He probably smelled like a sheep.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.800]   So he's thinking, "Dude, you should have sent me 40 years ago when I was at the top of my
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   game."
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.000]   But, "Ugh!"
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.280]   And God says, "Who gave man his mouth?"
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.040]   Inferiority complex is wounded pride and that is not humility.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.160]   And the third one is not cowardice, it's not passivity, it's not a quiet personality.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:44.080]   Some of the most arrogant people I know pretend to be quiet.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:50.680]   Some of the most stubborn people are quiet.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:58.320]   So loud people, they may be annoying, but that's not necessarily arrogance, okay?
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.680]   Alright.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.040]   Says the loud guy.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.400]   John the Baptist, he was a humble man.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.160]   Oh, but he was bold.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.360]   So bold that he told the king, "Hey, that's adultery and that is sin."
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.480]   And he got beheaded for it, eventually.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.560]   David, he looks at Goliath, he's like, "How dare this uncircumcised Philistine speak against
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560]   our God?"
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.080]   And you know his brothers actually called him arrogant at that moment.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.440]   David's not arrogant, he was humble before God.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.360]   Moses, when he leads Israel through the wilderness, he's always angry.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.040]   He's like, "You dumb people!"
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.920]   But he's humble before the Lord.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.600]   And you see it when Miriam and Aaron say, "Does God speak to you only?"
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   Moses is like offended a little bit, but he responds in humility.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.440]   God strikes him with leprosy, what does he say?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.760]   "Lord, heal them."
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.320]   Jesus, meek.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.280]   But he was not quiet or cowardly or passive.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.720]   So humility is not an external show, an inferiority complex or insecurity, cowardice.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.360]   If you are told to be humble, humble yourself before the Lord, if you take it incorrectly,
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.640]   you're going to end up defaulting one of these three.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   Think about it, how do you apply humility?
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.960]   It is not these three.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   I should just talk less.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.580]   Now that doesn't mean you're humble, you're like excited, you're like, "Oh, if I only
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.580]   was able to talk."
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.320]   No, you're still arrogant.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.420]   What is humility?
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:39.320]   It is the attitude that results from God being elevated to his rightful place in our lives.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   That's humility.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.040]   It has nothing to do with your personality.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.920]   The attitude that results from God being elevated to his rightful place in our lives.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:34:00.120]   If God truly and rightfully is God in our lives, we will respond appropriately and we
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.360]   will start living lives of trust and faith.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.480]   There's a quote by a man named W. Glyn Evans.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:18.400]   He says this, "I will not demand that God explain himself to me at any time, but this
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.720]   is characteristic of the unregenerate man.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.040]   I must be willing to let God be unreasonable in my view because he is not concerned with
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.000]   my understanding but with my faith."
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.360]   The unregenerate man sees contradiction in the world and demands that God justify himself
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:43.480]   before him, but the believing man makes no such demand but believes God supremely.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.880]   Humble yourself before the Lord.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.120]   So what is the appropriate response to the trials in our lives?
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.320]   One, we mentioned before, to continue in holy and untainted living.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:00.480]   Two, to be humble before God, having him elevated as Lord of my life and not just my get out
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.640]   of hell free card.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.280]   Lord of my life.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.440]   Every thought, attitude under the submission to the authority of God.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.560]   Third, to be quick to receive, hear, obsess over, and do the Word of God.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:24.720]   James 1.25 reads, "But the one who looks intently, obsesses over, stares at, scrutinizes
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   the law of liberty, and tabernacles there, abides in it, remains in it, he will be blessed
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:43.560]   in all that he does because he is not someone who hears and forgets, he's a doer."
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:52.400]   So the application here is, James says, study God's Word, obsess over it, scrutinize it,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:59.320]   not to just glance at it on your daily devotions, but to obsess over it.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or stand in the way
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.520]   of sinners, or sin in the seat of mockers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.760]   and on his law he meditates on it day and night.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.920]   All hours of the day his mind is on God's Word.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.200]   Blessed is that man.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:25.600]   John 8.31, Jesus says to those Jews believing in him, "If you remain in my words, if you
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.200]   abide, if you tabernacle in my words, you are truly my disciples, and you will know
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.920]   the truth, and the truth will," what?
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   "Set you free."
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:43.520]   And here's a bonus application.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:51.280]   This is not in James, this is just, I think, the whole of Scripture.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:37:01.120]   When a difficult trial hits your life, fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:09.080]   Hebrews 12.3 reads, "For consider him who had endured such hostility by sinners against
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   himself," why?
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.880]   "So that you will not grow weary or lose heart."
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:20.200]   That starts the whole section on how a father disciplines a son he loves.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.880]   Fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.080]   Fix your eyes on Jesus, cry out, "Hallelujah!"
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   God be praised.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   Be charismatic a little bit, all right?
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   "Jesus, I'm going to focus on you.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   Hallelujah!
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   God be praised!"
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:40.440]   And praise him in difficult circumstances, because he's risen, and one day, "This
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.040]   is not going to be an issue for me anymore.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   He's defeated and conquered sin, and his resurrection proves that.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   Hallelujah!
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.040]   God be praised!"
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.880]   Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:58.480]   Fix your eyes on Jesus, praise him, and then wait.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:07.360]   And that third one's hard, because that waiting could be a week, it could be 20 years.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.320]   And I'm going to wrap up with a little bit of a, like, I'm going to expose the sin in
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.960]   my heart to you.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:23.760]   So some of you guys know, and I shared this before in a sermon, maybe last summer, but
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.520]   I grew up under a very difficult father to live with.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:34.840]   Three divorces, different addictions, very irresponsible humanly and in human standards.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.340]   And I prayed a lot for him when I became saved in high school.
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.360]   And I gave up in college, because I was just so discouraged, and I don't want to pray for
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   him anymore.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:53.480]   And 20 years later, 2014, and I thought by then, you know, so I've become friendlier
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.960]   with my dad, just kind of sweep issues under the rug, because you know, no water under
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   the bridge.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   Hey, this is my dad.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.720]   So I had thought I had dealt with different emotions and bitterness and rage and anger,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.960]   because the Bible says, "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger."
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   Right?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   Hypocrisy, self-doubt, all of that stuff.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.400]   I was like, "Okay, I got to have a good attitude toward my father."
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.720]   So in 2014, I was in Korea, that was our third year there, and I got a phone call saying
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.580]   that he got diagnosed with colon cancer, stage 3B.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.400]   He had surgery, and then we arranged it, and I took a seven-week leave of absence, and
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.740]   I flew to America to try to take care of him, because he had three divorces, so he was living
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   by himself since 2008.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.740]   So by that point, six years of living by himself, there's no one to take care of him.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.460]   So I came to just take care of my dad.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:46.400]   But 40 years of irresponsible living doesn't go away overnight.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.080]   He refused to get any kind of treatment, any kind of chemotherapy, because even though
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.400]   he had surgery, the scans showed that it had spread.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.720]   So no, no thank you.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.280]   And then he just refused any kind of help.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.160]   I said, "Dad, I'm just going to go back to Korea.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   You're going to just drop dead."
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.640]   And I was just so frustrated, because I was spending all of the waking hours of my day
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.760]   trying to find him senior homes, but then he had to sign off on it, try to find him
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.360]   some kind of a hospice care.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.120]   And I'm like, "How am I going to do this?"
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.440]   And then, because of jet lag and because of anger, just in the middle of the night, maybe
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.080]   day four of my return to America, I woke up.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   First thought I had was, "You know, it'd be nice if he just died."
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.000]   I was shocked.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   I was broken.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.840]   I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.680]   I was so frustrated, I wished my own dad dead.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   And I rolled over right away.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:51.120]   It was like three in the morning, and I was like, "Praying God, I am a sinner."
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.160]   And I was like, "I'm a pastor.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:41:02.520]   I travel the world speaking toward reconciliation, taking care of children, and I'm here thinking
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:10.120]   that it'd be nice if he just made me less uncomfortable and was no longer a distraction
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   in my life."
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.980]   That squeeze brought out that emotion, and I prayed.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.440]   And then I called my wife, because she was in Korea, and it was evening time, and I confessed
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:25.040]   to her, and she said, "I thought a similar thought."
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:32.440]   I was like, "Whoa, sinner."
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.520]   And to this day, I don't believe that that was a sin I committed against God.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:43.000]   That was a temptation, because I immediately sought God's help.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.120]   What that did do, that exposed the anger, the bitterness that I just tried to mask.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.800]   I went back to Korea, defeated, failed.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.480]   Seven weeks, nothing had been done.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   I gained 10 pounds.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.160]   Now, all that had been done.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   I went back.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   Becky saw me at the airport.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   She was like, "Whoa."
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.520]   I was like, "Sorry."
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.160]   And I was stressed.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.760]   But just a couple months later, we've been praying for babies for so long, and then I
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.080]   got to make a phone call to my dad saying, "Hey, you're going to be a grandpa."
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.680]   And then we called him again.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.400]   "There's two babies, and a boy and a girl.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   Can you name them?"
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.520]   He's like, "No, I'm not qualified to name them.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   I've done too much wrong to name them."
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.680]   Asked Becky's dad to do it.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.440]   We said, "No, we want you to name them."
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.120]   So he came up with two Korean names for them.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.360]   The first one for our daughter was, in Korean, is Chu-hyang, which means fragrance or aroma
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   of Christ.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:05.440]   The second one, our son, he named him Chu-won, which in Korean is translated, hope in Christ.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.920]   He's still alive.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   He's still like being a 70-year-old kid, roofing.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.140]   He's healthy.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.520]   Never went to the hospital since.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.540]   And I don't like my father.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.400]   When he cancels lunch on us, I'm okay.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.240]   But I've learned to love him because I was squose.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:42.600]   Because that was revealed in my heart, I asked God to help, and we waited.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.360]   Waiting's hard.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.080]   Be still and know that I have the Lord.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.840]   That's hard.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.040]   Wait on the Lord is hard.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.860]   But the trials end.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:03.020]   They're used to sanctify us, to prune us, to wean us off the world, to serve as a testimony
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.340]   of God's faithfulness.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:10.080]   But the funny thing is, those prayers I prayed as a high school kid got answered 20 years
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:17.660]   later through cancer and was healed by what I believe, the arrival of grandkids.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:26.500]   After eight years of just struggle on our end, wait.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:34.380]   When a really difficult trial hits, fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:39.780]   your faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, born into the shame.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:45.500]   Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful man so that you do not grow weary of
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.700]   his heart.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.700]   Fix your eyes on Jesus.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   Say, "Hallelujah.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   God be praised."
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   Wait.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:59.820]   This you know, my brethren.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:12.380]   Everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:20.540]   For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God, but faith in his atoning
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:29.520]   sacrifice, life, death, and resurrection brought me to Christ.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:40.020]   And I am righteous before him because of my faith in Christ.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:54.700]   My encouragement is simply to be quick to hear, quick to obsess over his word.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:04.820]   Wean yourself off this world if you can and watch the world.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.660]   Praise God, observing your life.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.700]   That's what it says in both Matthew 5 and 1 Peter 2.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   And wait on the Lord.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.700]   Amen?
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.500]   Let's pray.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:30.340]   Father, help us to manage our holy anger, manage our unrighteous anger in a way that
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.980]   is appropriate for a saint purchased by the blood of Christ.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.420]   Help us to be faithful.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:48.320]   Help us to be humble through your exaltation in our lives.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.460]   We believe.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.460]   Help our unbelief.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.740]   We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:47:02.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
