[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Good morning.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.300]   My name is Jessie Kim and I'm currently in BAM ministry.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.880]   I graduated cosmetology school last year and I recently started working full time.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.360]   So my testimony isn't a big one time event, but there have been multiple milestones in
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.480]   my faith that have led me to where I am today.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.360]   I was born in Korea and moved to Toronto, Canada when I was very young.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.880]   I was raised in Toronto for a lot of my younger years, but I never really grew up going to
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   church.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.200]   I would go once every few months.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.120]   I was always that awkward new girl.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.960]   I also grew up moving around a lot.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.480]   So every couple of years I'd be in a new house or a new city, but the biggest move growing
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.640]   up was to Vermont in grade six.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.560]   It took me some time to adjust, but when I did, I really loved it there.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.760]   And then at the three year mark, my mom said that we'd be moving back to Toronto.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.200]   This was really hard for me to hear, but on top of all this, that year my mom was diagnosed
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.180]   with cancer and we were also living with my grandmother who was suffering with dementia.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.760]   This was a super emotional and dark year for me and eventually led to self harm and some
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.000]   negative thoughts.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.400]   And after struggling with these thoughts for a year, I was so tired that it led me to pray.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.520]   I said, God, I don't care if you change what happens in my life.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.680]   I just want the will to live.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.040]   And that's all I said.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.320]   Gradually after that night, the self harming stopped and I prepared for the move.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.840]   So in grade 10, I moved back to this old but new city.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   And that's when God started softening my heart and gave me the desire to go to church.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400]   So I asked my mom to see if there was a church near our house and I started attending.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.740]   My parents still weren't going to church at this time.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.520]   So I'd walk to and from church every Sunday and Fridays for youth group.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.080]   And at this point, I thought I was able to overcome my struggles because I had a good
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   personality and I was good at adapting to new situations.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.360]   After attending this church for a year, I went to one of the youth retreats.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.320]   And this is when God revealed to me that it was all him.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.240]   Until this retreat, I totally forgot about the prayer that I said that one night.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.920]   And I was reminded of that prayer and realized my hopefulness, my desire to go to church,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   it was all God working in my life.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.560]   That night is when I learned that God is so real and I repented for even thinking that
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.400]   the past years I was able to get through on my own.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.920]   And that he was with me all of those dark nights.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.360]   So the next few years, I started serving and getting really involved at church.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.760]   I begged my parents to go on mission trips, but they always said no.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   They're okay with me going on Sundays, but not spending too much time at church.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.280]   Eventually I graduated high school and they let me go that summer.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.080]   We went to a small native reserve island and spent our time there supporting the missionaries
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.760]   and local leaders.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.840]   This trip is where God taught me how perfectly sovereign he is because everything we planned
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   for that trip completely went out the window and our days unfolded as they went.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.000]   During this trip, I learned how I needed the gospel just as much as anyone on that reserve.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.700]   And because I was going to church didn't mean that I was saved.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.840]   After I came back home, the details of my life started to change.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.480]   I grew a desire for the work and I got involved with the campus ministry that following fall.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760]   Since then, I've had to take a few more stops before landing in SoCal, but I learned through
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.480]   it all that I don't have a home on this earth.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.760]   And when people would ask me, "Where's back home for you?"
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.960]   I would always have trouble answering and that fact used to make me feel very lonely.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.640]   But now I have comfort that this earth is not my home, but I have eternal home with
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.640]   my father.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   [ Applause ]
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   [ Applause ]
