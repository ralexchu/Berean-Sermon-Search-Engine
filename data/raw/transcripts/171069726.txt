[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.180]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 5.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:21.860]   And I'll be reading from verse 9 through 11.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.420]   Since therefore we have been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.500]   Him from the wrath of God.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.260]   For while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.440]   Much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.180]   now received reconciliation.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.660]   Let's pray.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank You so much for today.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.780]   And just the great privilege that we have to call You our Alba Father.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.020]   And we're able to pray to You, not because of our own strength, because of our own righteousness,
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.500]   but because Christ mediates on our behalf.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.180]   That He has mercy, that He's able to sympathize with our weaknesses, that we may not fear
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.380]   drawing near to You.
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.740]   So we pray, Father God, that we would take that privilege and that we would apply it
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.540]   even this morning, Lord God, as we worship You and listen to Your Word.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.620]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.260]   Last week I finished the sermon by asking you the question of why.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.020]   We talked about who loves us, when He loved us, how He loved us, and then we said why,
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.620]   but then I kind of threw the question out there for you to hopefully you guys had some
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.620]   good discussion.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.380]   If not, at least by yourself you kind of took some time to think about why does He love
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.140]   us?
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.580]   We know who He is, and the fact that the God of the universe has us in His mind, that fact
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.700]   alone should wow us and impress us and change us.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.500]   But when you consider when He loved us, not because we had potential, not because we were
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.380]   righteous on our own, we said while we were yet sinners, while we were yet His enemies.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.820]   And then how He loved us, that His expression of love was to send His only begotten Son,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.400]   His most precious gift that He has, and to offer it up as a sacrifice for our sins.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.220]   So the natural question that we have is why.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.780]   And just like when we're young, if you're raising young children, as soon as they're
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.980]   able to talk, one of the first things that they start asking you is why.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980]   You should go to sleep.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.980]   Why?
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.860]   Because you need to go to sleep.
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860]   Why?
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.860]   If you don't get rest, you're not going to go to school.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.860]   Why?
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.860]   If you don't go to school, you're not going to get educated.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.860]   Why?
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.500]   And they keep asking why and why, and then at some point it's like, just because.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   I told you so.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.380]   Eventually you kind of squash it.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.940]   I don't have any more answers.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.140]   You're naturally curious because, I think that's human nature.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.180]   If you don't understand something, you would ask why.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.300]   But for some reason, at some point in our maturity, we stop asking that question.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   Why do we have to go to work?
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   Because we have to pay the bills.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   Why do we have to pay the bills?
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   Because you have to have a house.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.900]   Why do you have to have a house?
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.280]   Just do it!
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.660]   At some point, we get to a point where it's like, stop asking why, you just do it.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.660]   Like why do you do it?
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.640]   Because everybody else did it.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.980]   Why do Christians do this?
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.980]   Because everybody else.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.060]   I came to this church and they were doing it, so I did it.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.700]   Why do we have to pray this way?
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.740]   Well, that's what I saw, and so I did it.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.620]   And so after a while, you don't even know why you're doing it.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.620]   You just do it.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.940]   You were raised in a Christian home, this church happens to do this, and everybody else
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.940]   is doing it.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.260]   And so, it's like, I guess that's what you're supposed to do as a Christian.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.860]   But the question of why is at the foundation of what we're doing.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.300]   So if you don't know why you're doing what you're doing, then it's absolutely meaningless.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.860]   If you don't know why you're coming to worship God, then you may not really be worshipping
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.620]   God.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.180]   You just do it because everybody else did it.
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.060]   That's how I grew up.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.380]   That's why it's extremely important to us when we talk about the Gospel, like Jesus
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.060]   Christ died for us, and we just accept that, we sing about it, we share with other people.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.020]   But the fundamental question, when somebody tells you that they gave their only begotten
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.300]   son to die for you, wouldn't the most important question be why?
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.460]   Wouldn't that be the most important?
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.700]   If I told you I had a hundred million dollars I want to give to you, I think the first question
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.060]   you would ask is why?
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.460]   You don't say, "Thank you!"
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.140]   First of all, do you have a hundred million dollars?
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.340]   That's the first thing you would ask, right?
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.620]   If you realize that I do, you'd ask why.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.540]   Because if you don't ask why, you're not going to get it like, "Okay, you know, like, what
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.540]   is this?
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.540]   Is this a joke?"
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.980]   I mean, He offered His only begotten Son while we were yet sinners to reconcile us so that
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.820]   we can call Him our Abba Father and have eternity with Him.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.860]   And then we don't contemplate the question of why.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.500]   Now, some of you guys may have, you know, as soon as we finished last week, I heard
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.860]   some of you guys saying, like, "Oh, it's for the glory of God," and I heard various, you
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.980]   know, discussions going on, and all of these things are true.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.820]   But at the end, it really is a mystery.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.460]   Because David himself says in Psalm 3, contemplating his love for Him in Israel, he said, "When
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.340]   I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.220]   in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the Son of Man that you care for
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.220]   him?"
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.380]   Now, there was no answer.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.460]   He just looks at who God is, and why He's so patient and merciful, he said, "Why do
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.460]   you do this?
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.460]   Why do you even care?"
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.420]   He says, "See, it's this mystery that Paul is talking about in Ephesians, saying, "I'm
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.980]   praying that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened."
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.500]   And he prays at the end of chapter 3 that you may have the, you may be able to comprehend
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.100]   the height and width and length and depth of the love of Christ, that you may be filled
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.740]   with the fullness of God.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.540]   So their whole pursuit of God is trying to understand why.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.700]   Why did He love us?
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.220]   How did He love us?
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.340]   It's important for us to see that, because that's what Paul's trying to, he was trying
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.340]   to do.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.740]   He's trying to set the foundation for your understanding, because if we get to the imperatives,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.540]   chapter 12, and say, "Hey, you should do this.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.500]   You should give your bodies a living sacrifice.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.100]   You should obey your leaders.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.460]   You should obey the authority.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.460]   Pray for them."
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.180]   If we get to that, get to, "Hey, you should, this is how you ought to live," which is extremely
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.940]   important, right?
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.460]   Because that's what, those are in the Bible too.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.140]   But if we get to that without really contemplating and wrestling with why, then you're going
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.660]   to end up just jumping through the hoops.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.540]   Just, "Hey, just do it.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540]   Just make money."
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   Right?
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540]   "Just buy a house.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.540]   Just do it."
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.140]   But sooner or later, sooner or later, something's going to happen in your life.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.660]   You're going to, tragedy's going to happen, or you're going to get laid off of the job,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.140]   and then you're going to, you're going to have a, God's going to force you to take a
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.060]   step back, and then you're going to be contemplating, "Why am I doing this?
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.860]   Why do I go to this church?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.540]   Why do I have these relationships?
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.380]   Why am I doing this?"
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.300]   So Paul has been trying to wrestle with this and teach us what's going on to get us to
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.020]   be contemplating and thinking and meditating so that we would have no understanding of
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.380]   the depth of what it is that we already have in Christ.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.720]   So up to this point, he's been talking about justification.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.080]   So now, starting from verse 9, he's going to be talking about, "If you have been justified,
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.200]   here are the benefits.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.160]   Here's what happened as a result of it."
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.760]   So if you look at verse 9, he says, "Since therefore we have now been justified by His
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.720]   blood, since now you have been the recipient of this love, how much more shall we be saved
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.640]   by Him from the wrath of God?"
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.880]   So the first and foremost that he says in verse 9, you understand it, is that you've
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.000]   been saved from the wrath of God.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.280]   You know, the way that people come to Christ today, the way that the Gospel is presented,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.720]   if we're not careful, is that Jesus becomes a solution to our loneliness.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.960]   Or Jesus can be presented as a solution to economic problems, or political issues, or
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.240]   even social justice.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.880]   There's so many poor people in the world and all of these things, I think, are connected
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.040]   to the Gospel.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:27.960]   But if the primary problem of mankind was economics, He would have sent an MBA.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.560]   If the primary problem was the government, He would have sent a politician.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.640]   But the primary problem of mankind was His sin.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.760]   So he says, "If you've been justified by His blood, how much more would you have been
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.680]   saved by the wrath of God?"
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.480]   First and foremost, the most primary thing that you and I need to understand about our
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   salvation is now we have been delivered from the wrath of God.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.960]   So when we contemplate and think about, you know, we've been delivered by the wrath of
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.680]   God, like, again, don't say anything, but how does that affect you?
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.400]   My guess is most of you are affected intellectually.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.040]   It's like, "Oh, that's good."
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.400]   But probably not emotionally.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.280]   The reason why is because we never felt the brunt of His wrath.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.400]   We don't even know what that looks like.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.320]   So when we say you've been saved from the wrath of God, it's just a theory.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.660]   It's just something that you know on paper.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.240]   But you weren't really delivered or you don't really feel like you were delivered because
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.640]   you didn't understand, you and I did not understand what it is that we were under.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   It's kind of like, you know, when you travel outside of the country that you're in, you
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.880]   don't realize exactly what it is that we have until you go to a poor country.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.840]   And again, like Pastor Peter Troom, his job is to take people into the poorest parts of
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.980]   the world and show how they need Christ and how they need help.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.320]   So he gets to see all kinds of stuff, right?
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.600]   But part of the benefit of that is that you come back and whatever it is that you have,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.280]   you see it in a different light because of that.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:18.040]   See, first and foremost, if we don't see our salvation as deliverance from His wrath, and
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.840]   we see salvation as Him answering our prayers so that we can go to a better school or He's
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.600]   going to help us with our marriage or we're going to have, you know, so many, so many
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   things.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.320]   And so as soon as He doesn't answer that, it's like, well, how come He doesn't answer?
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.400]   How come He doesn't love me?
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.000]   Without realizing the fact that you and I are delivered from the wrath of God, that
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   in and of itself is the greatest declaration of His love for us.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.400]   Even if we don't make a single cent, even if we lose all our jobs and are sick and die
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.560]   early, we would owe our eternity to praise Him because we've been saved by, from His
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.760]   wrath.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.320]   So that's why when we look at the book of Romans, when Paul is going to the detail of
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.520]   the gospel message, how does he begin the gospel message?
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.560]   Again, don't say anything.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.820]   Just think about it.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.320]   What is the message that Paul gives about the gospel?
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.560]   Today, again, you know, we want as many people to come in and hear the gospel so we try to
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.440]   cut the edges that are too sharp.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.960]   And maybe if we said this, the people are going to be offended.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.360]   And so we kind of highlight His love and grace and then we kind of downplay His judgment
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   in hell.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.040]   The concept of hell, I mean, I do hear it, but it's not as prominent as maybe it used
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.440]   to be at one point.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.240]   Paul presents the gospel and he begins from the very beginning chapter.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.280]   In Romans chapter 118, "For the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.920]   ungodliness, unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth."
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.160]   Just in case somebody read that and was thinking, "Oh yeah, those people, right?
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.960]   Those pagans who have orgies and sacrifice their children, they're under the wrath of
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   God."
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   Paul makes it very clear, right?
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.300]   Those who are under the law will be judged by the law.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.900]   Those who are not under the law will be judged outside of the law.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.040]   But repeated over and over again.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.800]   Again, Romans 2.5, "But because of your hard and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.360]   for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed."
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   Romans 2.8.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.640]   "But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.000]   there will be wrath and fury."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Romans 4.15.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.960]   "For the law brings wrath."
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:41.320]   Again in Matthew 3.7, John the Baptist, when he saw the Pharisees coming, he said to them,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.840]   "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.960]   Not only Paul, Jesus himself says in Matthew 5.29.30, "If your right eye causes you to
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.680]   sin, tear it out and throw it away."
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.400]   I mean, that's violent, right?
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.360]   He said, "If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.520]   It's better to go into heaven and avoid hell because of that."
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.000]   Verse 30, "And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.320]   I mean, it is violent.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.400]   So the imagery that Jesus is giving to his people is that that's how hideous his wrath
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   is.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.160]   Now, hell wasn't just some place.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   You know, we kind of try to create hell and to take the edges off of hell so that, you
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.480]   know, it's just a place.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.160]   Like God just withdraws himself, so it's just a bad, dark place.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   Bible describes hell as created by God to punish the devil and his angels and his followers.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.520]   And whoever chooses to worship the devil are going to have the same punishment under them.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.920]   So hell isn't simply God just kind of like, "Ah, I'm just going to walk away."
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.360]   The Bible describes it as his wrath poured out.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   He created hell just as much as he created heaven.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.480]   That's why he doesn't just say he delivered us from wrath.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.880]   He says it delivered us from his wrath, his divine wrath.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:18.200]   See, without understanding where we stand before God without Christ, grace wouldn't
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.400]   be biblical grace.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.160]   We make grace out to whatever we think grace ought to be.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.680]   You know, you can have people pour their lives into you, your parents or whoever, and if
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.800]   they don't give you what you want, they did nothing for you.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.280]   So grace becomes whatever we think grace is, but without understanding what it is exactly
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   that we have been saved from.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   J.I.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.960]   Packer says in his book, Knowing God, of God's wrath, he says, "God's wrath is never the
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:53.240]   capricious, self-indulgent, irritable, morally ignoble thing that human anger so often is.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:00.600]   It is instead a right and necessary to objective moral evil."
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.120]   Hell isn't just God saying, "I had enough and I'm just going to banish you."
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.360]   Hell is calculated.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.960]   Hell according to scripture was reserved for punishment.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.360]   Right now we live in a period of grace where God, the Bible says that he is withholding
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.480]   his judgment.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   So the wrath of God is being stored up.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.000]   But as the scripture says, "It is appointed for all men to die once.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.640]   After this comes judgment."
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.120]   So in Revelation 6, 15-17, it says, "Then when Jesus comes, the kings of the earth and
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.280]   the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful and everyone, slave and free,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.800]   hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks and in the mountains."
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.280]   Again, from our perspective, when we think of his second coming, he's going to come and
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   restore the church.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.720]   There's going to be a wedding ceremony to redeem his church glorification.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.320]   But for the world who does not know him, the Bible says when he comes, you would think
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.120]   that there will be mass revival.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.840]   But that's not what the book of Revelation says.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.880]   The book of Revelation says that when he comes in his full glory, that he's not coming as
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.040]   a humbled king.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.360]   He's not coming as a servant of man.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.480]   The Bible says that he's going to be coming in his rightful throne of king of kings and
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.720]   lord of lords.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.380]   Because the period of grace is over.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.440]   And now he will divide the wheat and the tares.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.920]   He will divide between the sheep and the goat.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.680]   So when he comes, he comes to redeem and to judge.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.140]   And those whose names have not been found in the book of life will go on into eternity
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.360]   gnashing teeth.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.480]   So the Bible describes him when he comes in verse 16, they said, calling to the mountains
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.360]   of rock, fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne and from
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.520]   the wrath of the lamb.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.520]   One of the greatest parts of the gospel that illustrated is the Lion of Judah, the coming.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:05.000]   And they turn around, they see instead of a lion, they see a lamb who comes meek, the
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.440]   king of kings and lord of lords who comes meek as a lamb to be offered as a sacrifice
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   for our sins.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:19.720]   And yet at the end times, they see a picture of the lamb as a judge, the wrath of the lamb
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:27.240]   for the great day of the wrath has come and who can stand it again?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.320]   Because we don't think, you know, we just kind of like hell is like, oh, we know it's
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   there.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.680]   It's kind of like death.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.880]   We know it's coming.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.400]   We know that every single one of us has an expiration date, but we don't like to think
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   about it.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.060]   It's just morbid to even talk about it.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.060]   We know it's there.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.260]   And it's kind of like the way that we approach hell.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.720]   We know that the opposite side of the cross is hell.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.880]   And yet we talk about it.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   We know it's there.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.520]   It's, it's mentioned in the Bible, but we don't really consider and contemplate and
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.720]   let it affect us the way God intended.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.920]   I think when Jesus came, the whole book of the old Testament was to, was to prepare for
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.780]   the people, for the Messiah to come.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:13.760]   And the way that God prepared the Messiah to come is to pour upon his wrath.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.360]   He the beginning of the nation's Israel's history.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.520]   He warned them, if you do not obey my commandments, here's curse upon curse, upon curse, upon
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.020]   curse.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:30.660]   So if you follow Israel's history, Israel's history, basically Israel piling upon themselves,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.320]   curse after curse, after curse, after curse.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.720]   And so at the end of the book of Malachi, the last prophet prophesies and he's done,
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.400]   there should have been a sense of terror.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.720]   If God is faithful to everything that he said at the beginning of Israel, woe is us, woe
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.860]   is us.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:56.160]   Because the only way that Jesus is going to make any sense, if they recognize the wrath
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.640]   that is to come.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.180]   But when Jesus came, that's not what they were looking for.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.860]   They didn't realize that they were under the wrath of God.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.680]   They thought Jesus was going to come, we're the apple of his eye, even though they were
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.360]   seeped in their sin, no matter how much they try to keep the law, they can rub off the
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.280]   dirt that was piled on from generation to generation.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.560]   Not recognizing that the King, the judge has come.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   The only beings that we see in scripture that seem to have recognized who Jesus was, were
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.720]   the demons.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.240]   When demons encounter Jesus, look at what they say, Luke chapter 4, 33-34.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.280]   And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of the unclean demon and he cried
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.680]   out with a loud voice, "Ha, what have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.720]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God."
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   The demons didn't see Jesus and say, "Oh, finally, maybe we'll have some deliverance,
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.640]   maybe he'll feed us, he'll take care of us."
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.820]   They knew.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.720]   They knew immediately as they saw him and recognized that he was the Holy One of God,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.040]   they fell in terror.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.080]   "Are you going to destroy us now?"
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.400]   Matthew 8, 28-29.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.560]   When he came to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:23.000]   met him, coming out of the tomb so fierce that no one could pass away.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And behold, they cried, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.680]   Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.320]   Isn't that incredible that the demons already knew that the time of torture was coming?
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.640]   As soon as they recognized Jesus, what did they do?
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.560]   They fall on the ground on their knees in terror.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.160]   "Have you come before your time to torment us?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.280]   Is it now are you going to bring judgment?"
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.720]   Because they recognized who he was.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.800]   See, that was the problem with the nation of Israel.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.720]   They didn't recognize who he was.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.980]   They had no fear of the presence of God.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.280]   They were praying for revival, not realizing that if God drew near, they would die.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.760]   They're praying for God to come near, to come close to them, not realizing a sinful man
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:20.080]   can't stand in the presence of this holy God and not be utterly destroyed.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   So they were hoping for revival.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.480]   They were hoping for Emmanuel, not realizing the wrath of God that was remaining under
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.080]   them.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   When you and I think about the cross, we think about His grace, His love, and His mercy.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.800]   But think about it from the perspective of the angels.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.880]   What a strange scene to see the God who created them hanging on the cross, bearing the wrath
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.560]   of God upon Himself.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.480]   I think Dr. Harris many years ago came and he gave us the darkness and the glory, and
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.920]   he was preaching through a different perspective.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.880]   I know a lot of us had a difficult time understanding, but it was so powerful because he was basically
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:08.000]   showing us the cross from every angle, from the Father's view, from Jesus' eyes, from
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.680]   His mother's view, from the soldiers, from the leaders of Israel, from Israel, from the
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   beggars.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.900]   And then he started going to the spiritual realm, from the angels and the demons.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.760]   What did they see when they saw the cross?
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:28.160]   As much as we see the cross as hope and mercy and salvation, think about what the demons
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.520]   saw.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.840]   They were already terrified that the time was going to come when they're going to be
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.980]   tortured because of their rebellion against God.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.840]   They look at the cross and the Father doesn't spare His own Son.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.600]   That He is bearing upon Himself all the sins of mankind on His Son.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.120]   So imagine if the demons are looking at this thinking, "If He doesn't spare His Son from
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.240]   His wrath, what will happen to us?"
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:05.000]   Can you imagine the terror that the demons were under when they saw Jesus being crucified?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.600]   That's why it says in James 2, 9, you believe that God is one, you do well, even the demons
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.720]   believe, but they shudder.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:20.080]   See, believing that Jesus was Son of God did not cause hope for them.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:28.200]   They were shuddering in great fear because if He really is God, we are ruined.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.760]   Second Peter 2, 4-6, it says, "For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.220]   cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept unto
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:42.960]   the judgment, if He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a heralder of righteousness,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.800]   with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly, if by turning
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.120]   the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, He condemned them to extinction, making them
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.600]   an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly."
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.040]   The whole book of Revelation is a glimpse into the wrath of God that's coming upon the
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   world.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.920]   It's kind of like the curtain that's been temporarily lifted and John was given a vision
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.400]   of what that wrath was going to look like.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   And he was terrified.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.760]   And that's what the book of Revelation is.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.040]   For those whose names are written in the book of life, it means we have been spared from
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.040]   that.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.480]   And yet it is warning to the whole world that this is what it means when he says, "The
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.400]   wrath of God remains on mankind."
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.240]   You know, those of you guys know, I'm a FAB and I'm proud of it.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.960]   I was born in Korea, you know, and I came when I was seven, went back and forth, and
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.080]   so I see myself as bicultural.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.800]   Like language-wise, English is much easier, but culturally I'm a FAB.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.360]   So whenever I hear the story about what's going on in North Korea, and I know North
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.120]   Korea, Kim Jong-un, the crazy guy, you know, we don't want him to have, you know, people
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.360]   are starving to death and nuclear bombing and all this stuff.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.560]   And I know most of us here that kind of detached.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.080]   But I remember what it was like when I was growing up in Korea.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.760]   I mean, even in a young age, because they were terrified of the Korean War happening
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.880]   again because the North Koreans were digging tunnels to come into South Korea and they
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.800]   were, they really wanted to go back to war.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.160]   So South Korea, especially in Seoul, we were right on the border, so if war broke out,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.760]   we would be the first city that get hit.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   And so there was constant fear.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.200]   If you see spies, if you see anything strange, turn them in.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.440]   And at 10 o'clock, the lights would go off.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   And if you don't turn your lights off, the police would come and bang it on your door.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.120]   And so again, as a young child, we live in fear.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.600]   But more I began to understand the history behind the Korean War, I started having more
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.200]   sympathy toward North Korea.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Because what happened was, because of this, at that time, the communism and capitalism,
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.600]   they were going back and forth and Russia backed North Korea and the US and the allies
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   backed South Korea.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.080]   And then they started to go back and forth.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.600]   And the North Koreans pushed their way all the way to tip of South Korea, to Pusan.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.080]   So everybody that was living there had to pack up their bags.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   And we're talking about everybody.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.160]   We're not just talking about a few people.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.400]   Everybody who lived in South Korea had to pack up their bags, get on a train or boat,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.280]   and they had to go all the way to the tip of Korea.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.760]   And then the allies come in under MacArthur's rule, he pushes them all the way back to the
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   border of China.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.880]   And then China decides to get in.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.440]   And so they start pushing back.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.720]   And so they're going back and forth, North and South.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.960]   And so they decided to say, "You know what?
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.000]   Too many people are dying.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.040]   This is not worth fighting."
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.160]   So they just drew an arbitrary line right in the middle of the country.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.400]   And if you happened to be stuck in North Korea, you became North Korean.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   And if you happened to get stuck in South Korea, you became a South Korean.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:51.200]   But the problem with what happened was, so many young men were forcefully recruited into
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.860]   North Korean army when they came.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   So they didn't join it.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.040]   It wasn't because they believed it.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.720]   They were forced to do it.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.360]   And many of the people who were forced to take their children and go back and forth,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.720]   and some people were up there for business trips.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.700]   And Christianity was thriving in the North Korean side more than the South Korean side.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.500]   So all the famous pastors and missionaries were all stationed up in North Korea.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   So when the country got divided in half, basically all of them got stuck in North Korea.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.360]   And now, after 50 plus years of watching what happened in the North, and how they've been
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.440]   under suppression and starving to death, and you even hear stories of cannibalism and all
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.340]   kinds of horrendous things that happened.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:41.160]   When I look upon that, I said, "Many of you who come from Korean tradition could have
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.280]   easily gotten stuck over there."
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.800]   And I know you say, "No, I was born here."
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.320]   Of course, I'm not talking about you.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.280]   I'm talking about your grandparents, or maybe great-grandparents.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.240]   They could have easily been stuck in North Korea or been dragged into the army, and we
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.960]   could have easily been part of North Korea.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.800]   So all the stories of North Korean suffering and the oppression that they are under, you
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.900]   and I could have easily been a part of that.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.320]   So when I look upon that, I have sympathy because, one, I thank God that that didn't
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   happen.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:22.280]   But then I look at the people who got stuck out there, and pray for mercy for them.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.320]   See, when you and I don't understand what we have been saved from and how you and I
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:32.200]   were deserving of this wrath, we don't recognize what we have.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.800]   That's why Christianity, to some people, becomes boring.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.920]   If the church isn't exciting enough, if it isn't done properly enough, if there isn't
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.200]   enough older people rushing out to younger people, if certain things don't happen a certain
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.040]   way, Jesus is not enough!
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:56.400]   See, if we really understand what it is that we have in Christ, all this other stuff is
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.800]   trivial, isn't it?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.240]   If we've been saved from the wrath of God, that you and I were deserving of hell, and
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:13.080]   by His Son's death and sacrifice, He plucked us out of that, for the rest of our lives,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:20.840]   even if we go hungry and sick, shouldn't that be a source of praise and glory?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:27.440]   It's because we forget what it is that we and I have been saved from that the air conditioning
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   becomes a big deal.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.960]   The distance of parking, the cleanliness of bathrooms, the smooth transition of songs.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.640]   All of a sudden, these things become a much bigger deal than it needs to be, because we
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.360]   have forgotten what it is that we truly have in Christ.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:53.160]   "Therefore," he says in verse 10, "for while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   by the death of His Son.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.360]   Much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life."
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:07.400]   If He was able to save us by His death, how much more can He sustain us by His life?
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:13.000]   Not only did He pluck us out of hell, we're secure in His hand.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.600]   That this was not a one-time thing, and that we keep slipping back to that.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.680]   He said it's secure permanent.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.760]   We have been justified.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.000]   If He saved us by His death, how much more will He reconcile us by His life?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.080]   Romans 8.31, "What then shall we say to these things?
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.760]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.560]   He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also with
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.720]   Him graciously give us all things?"
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.360]   And finally, verse 11, he says, "More than that."
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.680]   More than just being plucked out of hell, more than being able to sustain us, he says,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.760]   "How much more we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.520]   now received reconciliation."
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.720]   What is the ultimate goal of salvation?
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.360]   Ultimate goal of salvation is not simply to get you out of hell.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.480]   We have to be delivered from the wrath of God, because the ultimate goal was what?
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.680]   Jesus said, "I have come to give life, and to give this life abundantly."
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.200]   That's what He came to do.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.240]   Remember what the word "life" is in Greek?
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.640]   There's the bios, which means the biological life.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.880]   And what's the word that Jesus uses exclusively?
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.660]   Zoe.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.660]   To be alive.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.920]   He didn't just give us life so that you can exist in heaven forever.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.460]   He says, "No, He brought us back to life, to be alive."
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.840]   So let me ask you, when do you feel the most alive?
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.520]   Don't say anything.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520]   Just think about it.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.600]   I know some of you guys who've been a Christian for a while will say, "When I worship Jesus."
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:56.480]   This is not a seminary class, you know, you're not going to pass or fail, so don't say what
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.240]   you think is theologically correct to say.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.360]   I'm asking you a real question.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.680]   When do you feel the most alive?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.000]   I'll answer it for you.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.080]   Okay, if you disagree with me, you can come talk to me afterward.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:18.360]   I believe you feel the most alive is whatever that you are doing brings the most joy.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.000]   Correct?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Am I wrong?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.280]   No.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.720]   Whatever brings you the most joy.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.480]   So if bungee jumping brings you the most joy, you're going to have every opportunity you
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.760]   get and you're willing to, if you like watching basketball games and that's what brings you
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.040]   the most joy, that's where you're going to spend the most time, that's where you're going
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.960]   to spend the most money.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   Right?
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   If fantasy baseball or basketball is what brings you ultimate joy, that's where all
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.840]   your time and money is going to go.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.880]   Right?
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:57.720]   Whatever brings you the greatest joy is where you feel the most alive.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   So life and joy go hand in hand.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.200]   Yes or no?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   It is.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   Right?
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   So when he says that he has come to give life and give this life abundantly is to make you
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.920]   alive.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.900]   So how does this connect to what he's saying?
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:21.080]   If we have been justified by his blood and saved from the wrath of God and rescindled
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:28.640]   and we are firm in his hands, his ultimate goal of this so that you and I may rejoice
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:34.100]   in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received reconciliation.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:40.080]   So the greatest evidence of justification in the life of a believer is joy found in
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.960]   Christ.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.760]   Is joy found in Christ.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.080]   What causes a man and a woman to persevere in his faith?
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.920]   Because we believe that life is in Jesus.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.800]   If you don't believe that, you may fake it for a period.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   You could fake it for a period.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.640]   I mean, everybody can fake it for a period.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.240]   I can fake being a marathon runner for like three minutes.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.360]   I can even, I can fake that.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   I can put on the clothes and get in line and register.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   I can fake it.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.040]   You know, but I'm not going to fool anybody for a while.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   Everybody can fake it for a period.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.440]   You can maybe fake it in college, but you're not going to fake it in your twenties.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.320]   You can, maybe you can fake it when you're single, you know, and you're going through
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   the motion.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.920]   So you come to church and you, you, you do your duty, right?
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.880]   But you're going to go wherever that causes the greatest joy in your life.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.080]   That's where your life is going to take you.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:50.120]   So if it's not Christ, then eventually time has a way of weeding the church out.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.760]   Time and circumstance and, and, and suffering and trials has a way of weeding the church
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   out.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:03.800]   If Christ isn't, if your faith is not in Christ, if your life is not found in Christ, sooner
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.920]   or later, your life, your money, your time will be spent pursuing whatever brings you
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.240]   the greatest joy.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:19.840]   But those who have been justified, right, have been reconciled, access to God restored,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   that we have the source to go to the author of life and call him our Abba Father, that
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.560]   we've been plucked out from hell and we are sustained by his power, his ultimate gift
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.800]   for us is joy everlasting.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:42.280]   It's not simply to be in heaven forever, but to be alive in heaven forever.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:49.240]   If joy in Christ is not what brings you to church, it will eventually take you out somewhere
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.360]   else, right?
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   It will.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.640]   Maybe not today.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.240]   Maybe you have too many friends here.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.280]   Maybe there's too much history here.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   Maybe you've invested too much here.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.440]   But if your attraction is not Christ, sooner or later it will be revealed.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.400]   That's why the scripture says, when Paul says 2 Corinthians 5, 14 and 15, when all kinds
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.080]   of trials are coming, the very church that he almost died for is questioning his apostleship.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.720]   If there was any reason to quit as an apostle, it was in the context of writing this letter
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.040]   to the Corinthians.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   That is enough.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.000]   I've had enough.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.960]   And yet Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 14, for the love of Christ controls us.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.840]   In NIV it says compels us because we have concluded this, that one has died for all,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.760]   therefore all have died.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.520]   And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.400]   who for their sake died and was raised.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.280]   So again, as we again wrap up this morning's sermon, as we look and examine to see our
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:06.200]   faith, is our faith in our connection with Christ the source of my joy?
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.720]   Recognizing what it is that he has given us.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.160]   Are we living each day thinking about something else?
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.440]   Only if God would answer this prayer, if only God would change my circumstance, not realizing
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.400]   what it is that we have already been given in Christ.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.200]   Joy and happiness is not having what we want, but wanting what we already have in Christ.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.280]   I pray that that would percolate in our hearts and cause us to celebrate and be thankful
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.480]   for the rest of this week.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:38.800]   So let's take a few minutes to pray as we invite our praise team to come back up.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.560]   And again, take some time to come before the Lord and examine, to think that maybe if our
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.920]   salvation has become mundane and plain, and it doesn't move us as it used to, that as
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:55.200]   we study through the book of Romans, that it would cause us to reflect deeply, right,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.400]   of what it is that we have in Christ, the hope that we have in Jesus in the future,
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.640]   and how that affects our joy today.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.800]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leaves us.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.640]   (papers rustling)
