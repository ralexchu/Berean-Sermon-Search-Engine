[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be in part two
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   of what we started last week.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.840]   It looks like we're going to have another part next week.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.840]   Okay.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.920]   All right.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.040]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 through 24.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.640]   Again, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.320]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire and to darkness
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   and gloom and whirlwind and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which sound
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.180]   was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.000]   For they could not bear the command, if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.420]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.180]   But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.420]   and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.100]   in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.720]   and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood which speaks better
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.360]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.700]   Let's pray.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.860]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would help us and guide us.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.740]   May your word take center stage, protect this pulpit, Lord God, that your sheep will hear
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.900]   your voice and follow you and you alone.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.300]   I've shared with you many times that I started ministry probably earlier than I should have.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.260]   At age 19, my former discipler, he encouraged me to go to this church.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.700]   His friend was planting a church and wanted to go help out.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.660]   So I became a youth pastor at 19, just out of, again, just to be obedient to my discipler.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.740]   And then I've been in ministry since.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.020]   And there's a lot of things that I did as a young youth pastor.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.580]   You know, I was a youth pastor, I think, from 19 to about 24, 25.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.620]   And then I went to the college ministry, and then after that, the young adults, and then
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.260]   we ended up planting this church.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.260]   And there's a lot of things that I did early on that I probably would not do now.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.260]   And one of the things that I remember very distinctly was I got a cassette tape.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.420]   Those of you guys remember what cassette tapes are.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.260]   And the tape basically was a recording of a demonic encounter that this live radio program
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   guy was having.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.740]   And so he wanted me to listen to it.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.500]   And so I listened to it, and I said, "Oh, it's very shocking."
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.740]   And so I thought, "Oh, this would be a good idea to let the kids listen to it."
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.580]   And so I remember Elder Joe was also in the youth group at that time.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.580]   So I think he's the only one.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.580]   You were there, right?
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.580]   Yeah, he was there.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.780]   So he was one of the guys who got traumatized that day.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.780]   So it just happened the night that I was playing that audio, it was raining and thundering.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.120]   And it was up in the darker part of the church, Irvine Baptist, that I was at.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.300]   And then basically the recording is, it was kind of like that live Bible program, but
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.860]   Bible Answer Man.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.120]   And so people would just randomly call in and ask questions.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.660]   And so this young girl, I think she said she was maybe like 15 or 16 years old, she called
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.000]   and she seemed so disoriented.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.380]   And you could tell that in the beginning, they didn't know how to deal with her.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.180]   And she said, "I don't know why I called.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.900]   I just pulled over and something led me to call.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.820]   And I'm not exactly sure where I'm calling.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.820]   What is this?"
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.040]   In the beginning, it sounds like a prank call.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.620]   But as they are having this conversation, she started to say things like how she was
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.540]   raised in a satanic home and that her whole upbringing was to prepare her for this particular
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   sacrifice.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.120]   And so initially it sounded like, "Is this a prank call?"
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.000]   And again, this is all recording live on the radio.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.860]   And you could tell back and forth that even the hosts are kind of caught off guard not
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.780]   to know how to deal with her.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.460]   And so they started to share the gospel with her.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.620]   And then she said, when he mentioned the name Jesus, her response was shocking because she
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.340]   said, "Who is this Jesus, this man?
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.100]   Does he want to have sexual relations with me?"
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.500]   And obviously it's blasphemous what she was saying, but the radio host is just caught
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   off guard.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.780]   And she said that's the only thing that she knew.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.540]   So ever since she was a child, that this happened to her repeatedly.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.060]   And all of this supposedly was to prepare her for some sacrifice that they were going
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060]   to make.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.540]   Well, you can tell that the radio host is also kind of like trying to figure this out.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   Is this real?
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.500]   Is this a prank call?
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.100]   And in the middle of sharing the gospel with her, this is on live radio, her voice changes
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.260]   into a demonic voice.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.700]   And there's dead silence for about 10 seconds because you can tell the hosts were trying
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.940]   to figure out, is this real or not?
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.600]   And then the demon begins to speak.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.980]   And so the recording is that encounter that they have.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.180]   This was recorded.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.100]   So I didn't even listen to the whole thing.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.620]   I just thought this was pretty shocking.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.700]   It's just that, in my wisdom, I thought this would be great for our youth group.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.580]   And at that time, I think Officer Joe was probably 13, 14 at that time.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.580]   Yeah, something about that.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.020]   So we had children as young as 12, maybe even younger, all the way up to 18.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.500]   And at the end of the recording, it was maybe about 10, 15 minute recording.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.420]   At the end of it, they actually said when this happened.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.780]   And it just happened to be exactly that same day, two years before.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.380]   And it was two weeks before Halloween that she was being prepared as a sacrifice if all
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.060]   this is true.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.820]   And so obviously, the kids were in shock.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.180]   Even I was in shock.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.060]   And then thunder started to happen.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.460]   The rain started falling.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.580]   And then people were scared to death.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.060]   And then it just happened that night.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.580]   We were introducing Friday night prayer meetings.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.940]   And so we had 110% attendance.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.500]   And people were crying out to God.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.020]   It was a great way to start the prayer meeting because people were scared.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.100]   And the reason why I say I probably would not have done that again because I found out
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.020]   way later that some of the younger girls were so scared that they couldn't sleep at night
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.940]   for months.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.260]   And they didn't even tell me this until way later that they couldn't even wake up in the
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.700]   middle of the night because they were so scared of what they heard.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.100]   Now I tell you all of this not to say like, oh, the demons are real.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.740]   Of course the demons are real.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.500]   But the purpose of this story to tell you the story isn't that like, was that a prank?
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   Was that real?
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.020]   But that's not really my point.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.660]   It seemed very real.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.580]   But the point of my story is whenever we hear stories of demonic encounters, whether it's
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.140]   here or overseas, our immediate response is fear.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.620]   But is that fear based upon what we've learned in scripture?
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.780]   Or is that fear based upon what we've been conditioned to think because of media?
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:31.140]   Now I personally don't think Christians watching scary movies is a good idea.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.020]   Because your frame of work of the spiritual world is being framed by the world.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.140]   And so whatever you feel instinctively may be coming from you being exposed to certain
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.240]   things that is not biblical.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.420]   And I think in a large capacity that this intense fear that people have that the spiritual
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.260]   encounter is not dictated by what we see in scripture.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.260]   It's by the world.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.940]   And yet on the flip side, whenever we talk about encountering God, we talk about it so
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.180]   flippantly.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.180]   God spoke to me.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.180]   I went to God.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.660]   I went to his presence.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.540]   And not to say that none of that is true or it's wrong, but typically when we talk about
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.660]   God and his presence, we don't, there is no fear that's instilled.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.820]   We think of God as this holy grandfather that passes out candy.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.740]   And he, of course he doesn't like sin, but he just kind of brushes it off.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.300]   So my son died for you, cover for you.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.260]   And then we live by these cliches.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.580]   And so whenever we talk about the presence of God, there's no fear at all.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.140]   Just warm, fuzzy feelings.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.140]   And yet when we talk about Satan, there's this trembling that is inconsistent with what
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.140]   we see in scripture.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:52.900]   Until we have a proper view of who God is, other fears are always going to dominate us.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:09:00.900]   In fact, I believe some of the greatest heresies that creeps into the church is coming through
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.220]   men who are more fearful of men than they are of God.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.620]   Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.180]   Why despite whatever pressures or persecution or whatever things may come as a result of
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.740]   it, fear of God is what causes us to stay on the narrow path.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:24.500]   In fact, the scripture says in Romans chapter three, verse 10 and on, Apostle Paul gives
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   a description of the fall of mankind and what sins that they are guilty of.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.260]   And he, I'm going to just read a portion of it.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.020]   It says, "As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.600]   There's none who understands.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.500]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   All have turned aside.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.740]   Together, they have become useless.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.700]   There is no one who does good.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.700]   There is not even one."
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.940]   And he goes on and on.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.020]   And then he concludes that section by verse 18 by saying, "There is no fear of God before
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.500]   their eyes."
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.940]   And so the reason why he puts it that way is all the things that he mentions in the
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.940]   previous verse, he says the base reason behind why they are doing that is because they don't
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.580]   fear God.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.640]   They don't know who God is, so they don't understand the consequence of their sin.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.580]   And as a result, they can live in compromise.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.540]   They can live in rebellion.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.340]   But if we, you know, think about the spiritual encounter, there's greater, there should be,
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.820]   ought to be a greater fear of God than any fear we have of the demons.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.380]   In fact, the Bible teaches that whenever the demons can counter Christ, do you remember
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.240]   how they reacted?
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.100]   They got on their knees begging for his mercy.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.580]   Son of man, have you come before time to torture us?
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.460]   And that's exactly what Jesus says.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.780]   Fear, not someone who can destroy your flesh, but your flesh and your soul in hell.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:49.380]   In other words, fear God because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.700]   The whole purpose of Mount Sinai was to teach us to understand who God is and where we stand
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.900]   before God.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.140]   The law was given to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.780]   And the reason why he says that is because our natural state is we measure ourselves
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.140]   by ourselves.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.140]   And so, are you good?
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.380]   Well, what do you measure that by?
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.380]   I didn't murder anybody.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.980]   You know, I never went to jail.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.700]   So I'm a decent person because I do this or that.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:31.020]   But the whole purpose of the law, he says, was to reveal just how desperate we are until
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.660]   we recognize that how disgusting sin is.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:42.820]   I don't know about you, but when I was back in high school, I learned for the first time
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.260]   what goes into hot dogs.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.980]   And some of you guys probably learned it too.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.420]   And then once you, when you first learn it, it's like, oh my God, you can't put that in
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.620]   your mouth anymore because, and since then I got over it.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.940]   But once you understand the disgusting nature of these things, you naturally want to stay
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.940]   away from it.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.820]   And that's the reason why we are attracted to sin is because we don't recognize the disgusting
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:10.860]   nature of the sin until we recognize the destructive result of sin.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.500]   That because of sin, the utterly sinful and what results from the sin until we recognize
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.660]   a dire need because of the sin.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.420]   So the whole purpose of Mount Sinai and the giving of the law was to reveal exactly where
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.980]   they stood before God.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:33.660]   And not to simply put fear in them so that they can see and be brought to the cross and
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.500]   to beg that this is what I need.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:46.300]   See, people who come to Mount Zion without recognizing and understanding Mount Sinai,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:53.180]   it's like handing out, you know, it's handing out, you know, checks from the government,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.180]   right?
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.380]   The stimulus check.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.420]   The purpose of the stimulus check is so that people who lost their jobs can't get groceries
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.660]   so that they can pay their bills.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.220]   But for people who don't need it or don't realize that they need it, it's a down payment
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   for a Tesla.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.300]   It's down payment to take a trip.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.140]   They're going to pass it out, so I'll take it.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.980]   And so we don't recognize the value of it.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.500]   It's just kind of used, not to live, but just to enjoy.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.700]   So many Christians who have come to faith not understanding the necessity of the gospel
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.700]   and say, "Who wants Jesus?
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.260]   I mean, who wouldn't want Jesus?
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.820]   He loves you unconditionally.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.500]   And even if you sin, Jesus covers you.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.580]   One saved, always saved.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.740]   And if there's a possibility, even if there's 1% possibility that there really is hell and
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.180]   the gospel is just being passed out, I'll take it."
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:51.220]   And so what ends up happening is we take the grace of God and instead of recognizing what
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.620]   it is that we have received, the grace of God is given to us so that we can go to God,
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.140]   so that we can be reconciled with this holy God.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:06.140]   Instead, the grace of God is received so that I can live my life without the fear of hell.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.720]   And so you throw out phrases like, "Oh, we have Christian liberty."
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:18.300]   So Christian liberty was given to us so that we can use that to freely evangelize, so that
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.340]   we can come together, the Jews and the Gentiles can come together without having this fear
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.620]   that we're breaking this law.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.140]   You've been given liberty to freely come and worship God.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:34.620]   But an individual who does not recognize where we stand before God, grace is just a free
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.900]   ticket to do whatever you want.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:43.380]   That's why it's absolutely necessary that we understand the terror of God so that we
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.740]   can grasp the grace of God.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:52.500]   In Hebrews 12, 18-21, the description of Mount Sinai, this is what it says.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.220]   Remember what it says, we talked about this last week, "For you have not come to a mountain
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.820]   that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom, to whirlwind, and to
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.780]   a blast of a trumpet, and the sound of words, which sound was such so that those who heard
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:12.500]   begged that no further word be spoken to them, that his presence was terrifying, that even
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.380]   his voice when he spoke, they begged to stop speaking, for they could not bear the command.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.340]   If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.660]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, 'I am full of fear and trembling.'"
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.140]   So his presence and giving up the law cause terror.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:37.820]   In Revelation chapter 4, 1-3, there's a description of Mount Zion, and this is what it says.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:43.700]   "Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000, having
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.500]   His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.380]   And I heard a voice from heaven."
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.860]   It's the same voice that they heard in Sinai, like the sound of many waters, and like the
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:01.140]   sound of loud thunder, just like it's described in Hebrews, and yet the result was very different.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.540]   "And the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps,
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:12.220]   and they sang a new song before the throne before living creatures and the elders."
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:19.660]   You notice how the same voice of God that thundered created terror, begging to tell
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.420]   Moses, "Please do not, tell Him to stop speaking to us directly."
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.620]   And we're terrified of Him, and yet in Revelation, in Mount Zion, they hear the same voice, the
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:35.180]   same sound of thunder, and it leads to joy and celebration.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.380]   And it's the same voice.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.820]   How does one mountain cause terror and the other mountain breaks out in singing?
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.380]   See, that's the gospel.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:52.460]   How that same person could go to Mount Sinai and then come to Zion, and one leads to terror
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:59.640]   and one leads to celebration, is where the Bible describes the gap of the cross.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:06.800]   Without understanding that tension, without understanding how we cross this, is what causes
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.200]   the superficial worship.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.420]   Why people are bored with their faith because they took the grace of God like just free
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.560]   candy being passed out.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.460]   See, Mount Sinai is the path.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:29.560]   The same God who caused the terror is the same God that causes joy and worship.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.360]   So it's important that we understand how we got here.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.520]   Mount Zion, he says, is not a place where you can touch.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.300]   There was and is a physical place.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:48.000]   So where Solomon built his temple was on the Mount Zion, this physical place.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.320]   The city of David was called the city of, was Mount Zion.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   The whole city of Jerusalem oftentimes is referred to as Mount Zion.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.620]   Mount Zion is a reference to where God made his dwelling.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.960]   But he said it's not a physical place.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   He's not referring to any of those particular sites because he says it's a mountain that
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   cannot be touched.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.320]   It's a heavenly Jerusalem.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.280]   In other words, it's another word for heaven.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.900]   And so the way that the Bible described Mount Zion, he says in verse 22, it is the city
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:25.520]   of the living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, meaning it is a permanent dwelling of God.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.560]   In Psalm 132, 13 to 14, it says, "For the Lord has chosen Zion.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.040]   He has desired for his habitation.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.240]   This is my resting place forever.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.480]   Here I will dwell for I have desired it."
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.880]   Now the distinction between Mount Zion and Mount Sinai was Sinai was a theophany, meaning
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.780]   that God from heaven decided to make contact with man.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:55.080]   So temporarily he came and revealed a portion of his glory, not his full glory.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.920]   In fact, remember the picture that I showed you of Mount Sinai where it's just blackened
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.040]   because of his presence and his glory, the fire?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.640]   Well it's blackened, but it's not there.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.960]   He just made a mark.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.180]   But that's not where his glory resides.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:17.360]   And that glimpse of his glory, his temporary showing of himself, created this terror for
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   sinners.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:28.760]   And yet Zion is a permanent place where he habits, habitats forever in his full glory.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:37.340]   So how can you possibly, if imitation to Zion or Sinai created this terror just by his glimpse
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:44.400]   of his glory, how can a sinful man possibly be invited to Zion?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.200]   Again that's where the tension lies.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.920]   And that was the whole purpose of the giving of the law is to create this tension.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   I need to live.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.480]   Well where do you go to live?
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.840]   You have to go to that God because he's the author of life.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.020]   He's the one who has the Sabbath.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.480]   So if we want to find eternal rest, he's the one that we need to go to.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   Well how do I go to him if that God that I need to go to is at Mount Sinai?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.800]   See that's what Zion is.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:24.160]   And the nation of Israel understood this paradox, this tension.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   You remember when the Israelites were coming out and they're going into the desert and
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.360]   it didn't take them long for them to start grumbling.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.760]   Soon as they felt like the Egyptians were coming, they said, "Why did God bring us
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.320]   out here?"
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.400]   Even after all the miracles, they go to the other side, they say, "Oh I'm so thirsty,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.900]   we might as well die.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.680]   It was better in Egypt."
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   And so they just would complain and complain and God burns in his anger and he tells Moses,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.360]   "If I go with them, I'm going to kill these people.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.640]   I'm not going to be able to withhold my anger toward them."
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.320]   And so Moses begs him, "If you do not come with us, we will die out here."
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.400]   And so there was this tension that if he dwells in the midst of us, we can die because of
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.640]   his presence.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.680]   But if he doesn't go with us, we will die because his presence is not with us.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.260]   So there was this constant tension of we need you here, but we can't have you too close.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.260]   So if you basically study the Old Testament history of Israel, it's God's presence
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:36.440]   drawing near to Israel and every time he comes, he gives them strict, scary revelation that
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.160]   the only way that you're going to live is if I'm in the midst of your presence.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.560]   So he comes from Mount Sinai to the tabernacle, to the temple, and he gives them very strict
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   restrictions.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   Remember the book of Leviticus?
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.800]   He says, "I'm going to dwell in your midst, but the only way that you and I are going
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.740]   to have any kind of relationship is you got to follow these rules.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.480]   You have to recognize who he is and if you come to my presence in a nonchalant way, you
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   will die."
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.120]   They die.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.200]   But you know their history.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.280]   Over and over again, they sin, commit sin against God.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:18.700]   So in the book of Ezekiel, God has had enough.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.120]   And so his glory begins to be withdrawn from the nation of Israel.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:30.000]   So there's this scene in Ezekiel chapter 10 where the Spirit of God is in, it comes to
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.320]   the Holy of Holies and it begins to move to the threshold, the outer court.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.640]   And at the outer court, it rests, almost as if it is reluctant to leave.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.720]   And then from there, he goes up to the hilltop, looking over Jerusalem and the temple, reluctant.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.560]   And it was a scene of God's Shekinah glory leaving not just the temple, but Israel because
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.780]   of their sins.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.280]   And as a result of that, the protection for Israel is gone.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.960]   And as soon as that happened, the Babylonians come and they destroy them, take them into
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.640]   captivity for 70 years.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.120]   The prophets tell us the 70 years of captivity happens because they specifically disobeyed
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.680]   God's command for the Sabbath.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.440]   So every one of those 70 years represents a year that they disobeyed God in keeping
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.080]   the Sabbath.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.680]   So they understood, if God is in our midst, we are in trouble, we're terrified.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.360]   But if he's not in our midst, we are destroyed by our surrounding.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.840]   And so this constant juxtaposition.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.960]   So the Pharisees had an idea that we don't want this, we need him.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.120]   Even though we're terrified of him, we need it in our presence.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.360]   And so the Pharisees, basically their initial intent was that we're going to keep the law
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.920]   perfectly.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.100]   And even the word Pharisee basically means holy, to be set apart.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.760]   And that's why I said, you know what, instead of just keeping the Sabbath, we're going to
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.200]   be meticulous about the Sabbath.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.260]   We want to make sure that by keeping the Sabbath, that we're going to invite God's spirit back.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.960]   That was their intention.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.320]   So their relationship with God is described in the book of Hosea, where it's kind of like,
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.640]   you know, a boyfriend who cheated against his girlfriend.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.800]   And then he comes back begging, "I'm never going to do this again."
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.080]   And then the girlfriend takes him back, and then, you know, a couple months later, he
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.040]   does the same thing.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   And this cycle is repeated over and over and over again.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.140]   And he means it, but then he can't control himself.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.820]   And that's how it's described in the book of Hosea, between the relationship of this
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.600]   prophet and Gomer.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.800]   And he says, "This is what our relationship looked like, that I kept on being gracious
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.600]   to you, gracious to you, but you would continue to prostitute yourself over and over again."
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:56.040]   So by the time we come to Christ and His revelation, it was to bring us to the point to recognize
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.760]   that we are helpless, even with the best of intention.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:06.120]   And that's what Paul is describing in Romans chapter 7, a relationship with the Jew and
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120]   the law.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.360]   In Romans chapter 7 verse 13, he says, "Therefore, did that which is good become a cause of death
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.620]   for me?
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.620]   May it never be.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.720]   Rather, it was sin.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.360]   It wasn't the law, but the sin that was residing in me, in order that it might be shown to
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.360]   sin would become utterly sinful, to bring us to the point where we are desperate for
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.480]   the cross."
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.760]   And then if you look at Romans chapter 7 verse 19 and on, he describes, I'm just going to
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.680]   summarize, he says, "What I want to do, I do not do.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.360]   What I don't want to do, I keep on doing."
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.080]   And then leads to verse 25, "Oh, what a wretched man that I am!
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.400]   Who will set me free from the body of this death?
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:56.120]   As an unconverted Jew, I have no power to obey these commands, to bring Him so that
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.080]   sin would become utterly sinful.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.960]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am!"
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   And so the purpose of Mount Sinai was to bring us to this point, in verse 24.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.200]   I am ruined, like Isaiah says.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.240]   I'm undone.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:21.840]   If God is the one that I need to run to, to have life, and yet the greatest terror is
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.160]   also in Him.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.840]   How do I go to Him?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.400]   That's verse 24.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.000]   And that's where chapter 8 comes in, "There is now therefore no condemnation for those
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.680]   who are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.080]   free from the law of sin and death, for what the law could not do."
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.560]   And all the law did was reveal what you should be doing, what you could not do, which is
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.000]   what he was explaining in chapter 7.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.760]   He has set you free, weak as it was through the flesh, God did.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.920]   He doesn't say God will do or He will continue to do, He says He did.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.560]   And that's exactly what Jesus meant when He was being crucified on the cross.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.440]   And when He says it is finished, He's not saying that His earthly life is done.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.560]   He's saying that everything that He had decided, what God had planned, and was carrying it
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.600]   out for the salvation of mankind, so a sinful man can come through Sinai to get to Mount
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.520]   Zion, it is done.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.960]   That's what He means.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.560]   God did.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.480]   Seeing His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.080]   sin in the flesh.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.680]   And that's why He says at the end in verse 24 that Jesus' blood speaks better than Abel's
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   blood.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.720]   What does it mean that Jesus' blood is more articulate than Abel's blood?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   What does that mean?
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.680]   Well, if you go to Genesis chapter 4 verse 9 through 10, and you know the context, right?
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Cain ends up killing Abel because of his jealousy that God receives his blood sacrifice over
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.860]   the other stuff that Cain brought.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:09.240]   Because he was jealous, he ends up killing him and God seeks him out.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.080]   And in verse 9 it says, "Then the Lord said to Cain, 'Where is Abel your brother?'
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.160]   God knowing full well that he has already murdered his brother, and he said, 'I do
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   not know.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.360]   Am I my brother's keeper?'"
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.760]   Doesn't that reveal everything about him?
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.360]   He just murdered his brother.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   All knowing God asks him, "Where is your brother?"
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   He's like, "What are you asking me?
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   Am I my brother's keeper?"
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.200]   So you can see the sinfulness of Cain just by the way he answers that.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.400]   And God says, "What have you done?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.280]   The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground."
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.960]   What does that mean?
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.360]   What is his brother's voice?
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.160]   Abel's blood crying out for justice.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.120]   Abel's blood.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.940]   You committed murder and his blood is crying out for justice.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:12.000]   So when he says the blood of Christ speaks a better word than Abel's blood, he's
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.240]   saying Abel's blood cries for justice, but Jesus' blood cries for mercy and grace.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   That's the deliverance.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:28.800]   See, you and I, again, recently in a generation, and it's not just this generation, every
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.560]   generation, because you cannot live without justice.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.180]   Justice basically is righteousness.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.320]   You and I cannot live without righteousness.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   There's no law.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   Nothing wrong is done.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.880]   There has to be correction.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.280]   So otherwise, you can't live.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:54.960]   But the problem is when sinners cry out for justice, the first person to get the punishment
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.240]   for that is the one crying for justice.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.640]   I remember years ago when we were doing construction on the other building, not this building,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:12.920]   but the building that we had prior, and we hired a Chinese contractor, and he had a bunch
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.060]   of workers there, and I could tell that their English wasn't that great.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.400]   One day I showed up to work, and I saw a pool of blood on the ground where supposedly the
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.560]   sanctuary is supposed to be.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:29.240]   And my Chinese is just good enough to go to the bathroom and find something to eat, but
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.360]   beyond that, I can just pick up words here and there.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.840]   But I could tell there was some kind of a fight, and I found out that one of the workers
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.080]   got mad at the other guy, and he took up a wrench, and then he basically poked him on
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.860]   the face.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.500]   So I said, "What's going on?
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.960]   This is crazy."
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.680]   And so the guy who got poked in the face, I mean, the blood had already stopped bleeding,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.520]   but I could tell where he got punched.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.920]   And the other guy was outside just roaming around, but he was still there.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.520]   But the guy was angry, and he said, "No, apology is not enough.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.840]   Look at this."
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.000]   And so he's saying this in Chinese, obviously, and then one of the guys was interpreting
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   this for me.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.480]   And so he said he wanted to call the police.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.840]   So I said, "Okay," and then called the police.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.120]   So the police come, and he's trying to take report, but all of a sudden, as soon as the
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.880]   police come, no one speaks English.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   Everybody's playing dumb.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.000]   And so it was kind of weird, because I know you speak English.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.440]   I just talked to you in English.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.440]   I know that guy speaks English.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.640]   I mean, he's broken English, but he speaks enough.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.960]   But all of a sudden, it became quiet, but the guy who was wronged, he demanded, it's
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.160]   like, "I want the police," and the police came, and they called the ambulance.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.860]   The ambulance came, but his English really was not good.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.760]   And so after a while, you could tell that the officers who were there was the coastal
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   Mesa police officers.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.600]   So something's fishy, right?
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.480]   All of a sudden, nobody speaks English.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.600]   No one wants to help, and everybody's kind of avoiding us.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.520]   So he kind of caught wind that maybe these guys are here illegally, right?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   And so I was like, "Oh, shoot.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   They're going to get in trouble."
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.480]   And the officers were very nice, and he didn't want to get them in trouble.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.620]   So he got a interpreter on the phone from the department and started speaking Mandarin
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:21.200]   to the guy who was in the ambulance, and basically, "Tell him," he said, "If we take this to
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:28.120]   the police and we take this to the court, they're going to want to see your papers."
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.200]   And I know exactly what he was talking about.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.160]   And then he gets on the phone, and then she speaks to him in Mandarin, and all of a sudden,
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.320]   he hangs up the phone, he takes everything off, and he jumps off the ambulance, and he
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.360]   was gone.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.960]   And so the officer looked at me, just smiled, just like, "Yeah, that's what I thought."
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.240]   And then they just, just nice enough, and he just left.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.300]   And obviously, we know what happened.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:57.000]   As much as he wanted justice, he couldn't take it to court, because he knew that if
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.400]   he stood before the judge, that he would be judged before the other guy.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.280]   They ended up working this out, right?
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.520]   They ended up, like, the guy started giving him money, and so they just, one guy just,
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.280]   the guy who caused the damage ended up leaving, and he got paid, and so they were able to
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.200]   work it out in that way.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.920]   But the point that I'm trying to make is, sinners cannot stand before a holy God demanding
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   justice, because justice means you get what you deserve.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.200]   You cannot live without justice.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.880]   But the problem with mankind is that as much as we need justice in order to live, that
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.520]   this justice is going to destroy us.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   That's a tension that the whole world lives under.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   God is the only author of life, and yet if we go to the author of life, we will be destroyed.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:59.280]   But the Bible says, "He didn't bring us to justice."
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.200]   Justice is getting what you deserve.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.160]   Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.400]   Where we deserve to be destroyed, and God has mercy on us.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.320]   You get pulled over, you're going 105 miles per hour, the police says, "I'm not going
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.920]   to give you a ticket."
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.680]   That's mercy.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.280]   Grace is getting what you don't deserve.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.840]   They pull you over, they decide not to give you a ticket, and they give you a $30 gift
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.560]   certificate to Chick-fil-A. That's grace.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.960]   Small grace, but that's grace.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.320]   So justice is getting what you deserve.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.680]   Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.480]   Grace is getting what you don't deserve.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.760]   And so in the New Testament, God didn't just carry out justice.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:57.960]   He absorbed the justice of God, that we will be spared from hell that we deserve.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.040]   But He didn't leave us there.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.760]   He raised us up as co-heirs with Christ, so that when we are in heaven, in the presence
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:12.480]   of this Almighty God that would bring terror to sinners, they break out into worship.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.680]   See, when sinners come to Christ not recognizing what it is that we have in Christ, they get
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.520]   bored because they receive the grace of God like it was just free candy.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520]   It was just being passed out.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   It's like, "Oh, I'll take it.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.080]   Oh, raise your hand, come down the aisle.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.640]   Oh, okay, I'll take it, just in case."
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.360]   There's so many people in the church, it's harder, it's more sacrifice for them to leave
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.200]   the church because they grew up in the church.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.800]   They have to forsake relationships.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.480]   Their community is based around Christianity.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.720]   So it's hard for them to leave the church.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:51.240]   So they stick around, yet never fully grasping what they have in Christ.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.960]   They're never true worshipers.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.040]   They're attenders of the church, but they're not true worshipers of God because worship
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.980]   is something that is inspired because of what you recognize that you have in Christ.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:11.120]   But a nominal Christian only understands the superficial stuff on the outside, the benefit.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:18.720]   So therefore, he's in the church, but he does not know Christ, and yet he never truly worships.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.040]   It doesn't produce joy.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   It's just obligations.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.440]   It's the law that I need to obey.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.640]   We're not attracted to Christ.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   See, the Bible says that we are in eternity with Christ in Zion because he's the new mediator
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.940]   in a new covenant.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:44.400]   As Moses was mediating between Israelites and God, even he himself was terrified.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:52.120]   And yet Christ stands as our mediator forever in eternity by his blood, sprinkled, cleansed.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.340]   This is the Son of God we're talking about.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   The Son of God did that for us.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.020]   He didn't just snap his finger and say, "You know what?
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.020]   I'm going to save you from hell."
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.980]   The Son of God absorbed the justice that you and I deserved.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.620]   And this is what we celebrate.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:14.060]   When we do not recognize this, we just come to church, check off the things that we're
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.720]   obligated to do, and yet there's no joy in our lives.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.700]   You notice that he doesn't say, "We will come to Zion," but he says, "We have come to Zion.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.020]   We have come."
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.360]   Salvation is the ultimate fulfillment of what he already started.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.760]   So we don't live in misery until we get to heaven.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.600]   That life is restored now, here, but not fully fulfilled yet.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.960]   So the greatest evidence of true salvation is the worship that God inspires because of
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.620]   what he has done.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:54.960]   You know, you and I live in one of the richest places in the world.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.400]   Even if you live in a one-bedroom apartment in the worst neighborhoods in this area, in
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.960]   Orange County, you're still living in the most expensive place in the world.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.900]   And I'm not just talking about in our generation, in all the generations put together.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.940]   The kind of access that we have.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.480]   Boba is a luxury that poor people ... Go to Africa and ask them, "You want to get some
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   boba?"
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480]   I say, "Boba?
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   What's boba?"
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.240]   "Well, I got to go garage sale."
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   "Garage sale?
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   What's garage sale?"
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   "Internet."
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   "Huh?
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.480]   I heard of it."
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:35.200]   And yet, more than not, people live in want.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.880]   I don't have enough.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.520]   Because we get on the internet, or we come to church and we compare ourselves with people
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.520]   who have a bit more than we have.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:50.060]   And though we are rich beyond the imagination of the rest of the world, we live every day
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.160]   thinking, "Only if I had a little bit more."
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.760]   But we do the same thing spiritually.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   The Bible says that everything that you and I need for a life of godliness has been given
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.560]   to us in the knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.840]   Everything that you and I need has been given to us in the riches of His glory, and yet
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   most Christians live their lives thinking, "Only if I had more.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.460]   Only if I had better community.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.720]   Only if I had better teaching.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.800]   Only if I had better this and better that."
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.560]   Not realizing what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.200]   So instead of worshiping, we crumble.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:40.920]   You see, if we don't realize what we have been saved from in Sinai, we come to Zion
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.680]   and we're bored.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.840]   And sad to say, this is the state of our generation.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.560]   Christians who profess the right things with their mouth, but bored in their walk with
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.620]   God.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.060]   So worship is an obligation.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.900]   Discipleship is an obligation.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.280]   Sharing is an obligation.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.460]   Prayer is an obligation.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.100]   What do I have to do to help me belong to this community?
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   Yet what does Jesus say?
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.800]   There's going to come a time where He's not going to be asking, "Are you worshiping
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.140]   in this mountain or that mountain?"
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:18.880]   But He's seeking people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.280]   Let me conclude with this because this is one of my favorite passages.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.540]   And those of you who've been in our church for a while, you know, I've read this so many
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.340]   times, but I'm going to read to you again.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.840]   It's this whole drama of the gospel that is portrayed in the book of Revelation chapter
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   five.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.600]   In verse one it says, "I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals."
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.440]   Well, this book he's referring to in other passages in Revelation is referred to as the
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.280]   book of life.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.160]   And the book of life basically is who can be at Zion.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.880]   That's basically what it is.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.420]   Who can be in the presence of this holy God?
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.900]   And he says, "And I saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.280]   up the book and break its seal?'"
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.320]   In other words, who can take a look, who can be added to this?
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.240]   No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   into it.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.960]   "Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.960]   look into it."
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.720]   In other words, oh, what a wretched man.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   There's no hope.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.160]   No one can open it up.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.240]   Verse five, "And one of the elders said to me, 'Stop weeping.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.760]   Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has overcome, as
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.000]   so as to open the book and its seven seals.'"
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.940]   So he says the lion of Judah is coming.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.940]   He is able.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:43.280]   No one else is able but the lion of Judah, and clearly he's referring to Jesus.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.040]   The lion of Judah is the Messiah that's going to come.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.920]   He says he will come.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.600]   And so John turns his head to look for the lion of Judah in verse six, "And I saw between
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:01.900]   the throne with the four living creatures, the elders, a lamb standing as if slain, having
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:06.000]   seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent out into all the
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.300]   earth, and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.160]   When he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.900]   the lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are prayers of
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.360]   the saints, and they sang a new song."
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:35.220]   Man, the lion of Judah, he turns to look for the lion and he sees the lamb because we could
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.880]   not go to the lion.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.780]   He came as a lamb and covered us with his blood.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:50.580]   And it is this picture that is portrayed for us that causes them to break out in worship
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:55.860]   and singing a new song.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.440]   This is a description of the church.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.280]   This is a description of the church.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:09.680]   People who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ can help themselves.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.720]   But to break out in worship, not because it's time to worship, not because they prepared
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:21.920]   a great set, not because we heard a great message, but because we're before a great
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.520]   God.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.760]   Why would you do this for us?
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.840]   Why would you send your only begotten son?
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.440]   I know my sins better than you do.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:42.200]   I can pick any period of my life, even after I became a Christian, that I would have easily
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.600]   been disqualified.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.900]   And you know your sins better than anybody else.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.520]   You know what you do in secret.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.520]   You know the compromises that you fall into.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.260]   You know how easily you get entangled with this world.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.800]   You know how much you hated God because he didn't answer your prayers and things didn't
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.120]   work out the way you wanted to.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.560]   And yet he continues to invite us to come.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.920]   Why would he do that?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.480]   Why would he do that?
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.680]   That's the church.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:26.480]   Church filled with people who have no answer to his love.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.680]   And so we sing a new song.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:35.480]   A song that can never be inspired by anything in this world.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:42.080]   No amount of young love, no amount of love and treasures in this world that would inspire
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:47.240]   you like the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.600]   That's the Zion that he's referring to.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   And that's why we need to understand Sinai because his invitation is to Zion.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.080]   I actually want to sing a new song with you.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.080]   It's not a new song.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.480]   It's actually an old song.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.560]   In fact, everything I know is old.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.640]   Amazing Grace written by John Newton.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.520]   Former slave trader by his own admission was worst of sinners.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.280]   And I think humanly speaking, we could agree.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   He lived his adult life doing horrendous things for slave trading.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:36.960]   And on one of his journeys, the boat hits a storm and the ship's about to sink.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.040]   As he's in the water, he begs God for mercy.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.640]   If you save me from this, I will repent and serve you.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.600]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.280]   Doesn't happen overnight, but he kept his promise.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   He repents.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   He lets go of the slave trade.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.480]   In fact, he lives the rest of his life fighting slave trading because he understands the evil
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.920]   of slave trading.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:04.240]   He's the man behind William Wilberforce who fought against slavery in England.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:12.080]   And so he writes a song, Amazing Grace, to basically as a testimony of his life.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.200]   It starts, "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound."
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.680]   We say that word, Amazing Grace, so often, but we don't take enough time to actually
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.160]   ask, is it really amazing?
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.560]   Is it just words that we say?
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   I think when he penned it, he knew.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:38.960]   He knew how amazing that he would save a wretch like me.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.120]   We may look at that and say, well, I never traded slaves and I didn't do anything to
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:54.640]   deserve to go to jail, but in the presence of this holy God, our testimony is no different.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.800]   Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.360]   I once was loved, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:08.600]   'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:15.240]   I mean, it's so profound.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.080]   The fact that he recognized the terror of God was the grace of God.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:28.160]   And it was that same grace that relieved him from that fear that he can get to Zion.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:34.640]   How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:42.440]   Maybe many of us can remember the first hour we believed, how much he meant for us.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:49.400]   We broke out into songs, but so many years of being concerned for life, raising children,
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:55.920]   so many years have gone by, and we can't confess that that's where we are now.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.680]   The precious did the grace appear the hour I first believed.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:06.960]   Remember the height from which you had fallen, repent and do the things that you did at first.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.880]   And it's a call back to our first love.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.400]   The Lord had promised good to me.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.560]   His word my hope secures.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.640]   He will my shield portion be as long as life endures.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   He's our mediator.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   He protects us.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.560]   His blood covers us.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:32.040]   And we've been there 10,000 years, Zion, bright shining as the sun.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.800]   We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.560]   That this new song is never going to get old.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.800]   Is never going to get old 10,000 years and we've just begun.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:51.960]   And this is a man who understands God's grace.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:58.640]   This is why it's so important for us to recognize the full counsel of God.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.560]   That we know what it is that we have in Christ so that we may worship him in spirit and in
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:02.840]   truth.
