[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   ...to Romans chapter 8. Again, I'm going to highlight verse 26 through 30. We're going
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.040]   to be mainly focused on the two verses in 26-27, the ministry of the Holy Spirit in
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.440]   our prayers. Romans chapter 8, 26 through 30. "Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.140]   weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.060]   for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.060]   mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.620]   We know that for those who love God, all things work together for good. For those who are
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.600]   called according to His purpose, for those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.240]   conformed to the image of His Son, in order that He might be the firstborn among many
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.780]   brothers. And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:03.460]   also justified; those whom He justified, He also glorified." Let's pray.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460]   Gracious and loving Father, we entrust this time to You. We thank You, Father God, for
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.540]   Your grace, not only spiritually, but even physically, Lord God, that in safety we can
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.580]   raise our children to be able to gather together and celebrate Christ and what He's done.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.780]   Help us, Lord God, to be good stewards of every good gift that You've given. Especially,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.220]   Lord, as You've given us Your Word and Your Holy Spirit to help us, we pray that power
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.060]   of the Holy Spirit would do more than just instruct, but to illumine our hearts, that
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.340]   we may hear Your voice and no one else's. So we entrust this time to You, in Jesus'
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.260]   name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.660]   I know that our collegians have taken their finals, at least a lot of you guys have taken
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.140]   your finals and you stayed up all night studying and preparing, you've taken your tests. And
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.940]   I don't know how quickly you get your results, but you know how frustrating it is when you've
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.880]   given everything that you've gotten and you just fall short, right? And you've stayed
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.380]   up all night, did everything that you're supposed to do, and then you get the final result and
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.900]   you fail. The frustration that you feel. And you don't have to be a college student to
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.020]   know how that feels. You could be somebody at work and you've been given an assignment
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.780]   and you've really given your best. You've stayed long hours, you did everything that
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.580]   the company told you to do and you're supposed to get this project done and at the end it
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.740]   just didn't work. And after everything that you've done, you've only gotten yelled at
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.820]   because you just didn't complete the job. Or you were trying to get the sales and you
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.420]   did everything to appease this customer and it just didn't work. I think something a little
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.060]   bit more personal at home is a lot of times, you know, between husband and wife, when you
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.700]   have frustrations with communication. The husband is trying his best to love his wife
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.620]   and to understand her, but no matter what he does, it just always seems to come short.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.340]   And vice versa. You know, wife is doing everything. She's cooking his most favorite food and doing
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.700]   everything that he could possibly do and at the end, you're just missing each other. And
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.460]   the frustration that you feel when you've given everything you've got and it just doesn't
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:21.300]   seem to be enough. Well, how do you feel when that happens? Frustrated? Dejected? Possibly
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.460]   wanting to give up? You know, it's one thing if you didn't give your best. It's one thing
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.180]   where you're just kind of nonchalantly going through this thing and so answer is pretty
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.540]   clear when that happens. Like, I need to study harder. I need to work more. I need to be
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.260]   more sparred about the way I approach things. But, you know, there's things that we do that
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.460]   we've done everything we could possibly do and it just still wasn't enough. A lot of
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.580]   people feel that way about their spiritual life and their walk with God. If you've been
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.820]   walking for a while where you felt like, you know, maybe there was a period when you've
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.860]   given everything that you've gotten, you've been disciplined, went to church and did Bible
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.020]   study and served and went to missions, did everything you could possibly do, but the
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.260]   end result wasn't what you expected. And you go through a few cycles like that and
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.420]   after that you just kind of feel dejected, you know, and hopeless maybe. And if you're
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:24.460]   not careful, it leads to despair and that despair leads to giving up and you quit. See,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.820]   whenever we strive anything and given our best and we come short, that's usually the
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.860]   end result, whatever it may be. But you could see the logic behind why our salvation is
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.380]   by grace and by grace alone. Because if God left it to us and said, "If you give your
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.180]   100% and you did the best that you could and if you achieved an A rather than a B or C
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.300]   or D, you can get to heaven," the end result would be exactly what I described to you.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.100]   You would continually have this cycle of dejection and then eventually just end up quitting.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.700]   But the reason why we are able to persevere is because the scripture tells us that what
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.180]   we could not do, even with our best effort, Christ did. So our assurance of salvation
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.180]   is not based upon our hard work, but upon His grace. 1 Peter 1, 3-5 it says, "Blessed
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.980]   be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. According to His great mercy, He has caused
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.220]   us to be born again. According to His mercy, He caused us to be born again to a living
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.620]   hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable,
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.300]   undefiled and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.700]   through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." See, our assurance of salvation
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.100]   isn't based upon where God is looking at us to see how much you're doing and how hard
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.540]   you're working and see who achieves and who does not. If that was the case, we would always,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.540]   we would, our salvation and our walk with God ultimately would lead in only despair.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.980]   The reason why we're able to persevere is because He gave us salvation. And He assures
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.180]   us that our assurance is based upon what He has done and what not we do, what we do. 1
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.980]   Corinthians 1, 7 and 9 it says, "So that you are not lacking in any spiritual gifts, so
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.700]   as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will sustain you to the
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.660]   end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful by whom you were called
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.540]   into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. It's because of His faithfulness,
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.940]   He says He will sustain us, He will make us guiltless until the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.940]   Now that's what Paul has been teaching through the book of Romans all the way up to now.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.980]   But remember when Paul began to teach that in chapter 6 he says, "Well if that's the
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.220]   case, isn't that going to lead to licentiousness?" If you're saying that we don't have to obey
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.900]   the law, it is not by our effort that we get saved, won't that lead to a group of people
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.100]   who just say, "Well I'm just going to do whatever I want." Paul says, "By no means." That is
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.860]   not what happens at all. And he tells us why he gave us the Holy Spirit. There's a distinction
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.260]   between a non-Christian and a Christian. A Christian has been baptized with the Holy
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.260]   Spirit, it is the Holy Spirit who empowers us. So in chapter 8, 2-8, he gives us that
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.820]   the Holy Spirit empowers us to obey the commandments of God. Verse 9-13, the Holy Spirit enables
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.100]   us to resist our flesh. Verses 14-17, the Holy Spirit reassures our adoption, our assurance
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.900]   of salvation comes from the ministry of the Holy Spirit. And then verse 18-23 it says,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.060]   "The Holy Spirit guarantees our inheritance as adopted children along with Christ." So
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.980]   he's been laying out that the distinction between a non-Christian and a Christian is
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.700]   the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer. Well today's passage that we're
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.740]   looking at, verse 26-27, he says, "The Holy Spirit now, He empowers us to pray effectively
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:15.740]   that God would hear us." I think you will agree with me, at least to the extent that
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.500]   it's either the most important or one of the most important gifts that we've been given
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.580]   as a child of God is that we are able to pray to Him, that we have access to Him. That we're
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.500]   not just legally His children. It's like we went through the adoption papers and stamped
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.740]   the name, but we're still living in the orphanage and the one who adopted us is living somewhere
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.020]   else. You know, a lot of Christians live like we're just legally His children, but in all
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.340]   practical purposes there's no relationship. The whole purpose of salvation is to restore
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.500]   what was broken. So it wasn't just simply legally that we became His children, but the
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.180]   benefit that we have as children of God, that we have access to Him, that we are able to
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:03.180]   pray to Him, and He hears us as His children. Not just some creation, but as His children.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.100]   And so over and over again He says, "If we pray, He hears us." And we are encouraged
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:16.100]   and challenged and commanded even to come to Him in prayer. So if prayer is a distinction
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:23.340]   between a Christian and a non-Christian, because we have access to this Father, the next question
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:29.580]   we have to ask ourself, "Then how is your prayer life?" Now I don't have to survey the
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:35.980]   church because I've surveyed many, many times. If you ask most people which spiritual discipline
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:42.980]   they struggle with most, you put it between 1, 2, 3, 4, usually people say, "I'm good
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.220]   with fellowship." Because I went to Disneyland and we spent 24 hours together yesterday and
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.620]   we were all Christians, so we had fellowship. We're good. We went and grabbed boba every
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.620]   other day, so we're good. Probably not real fellowship, that's not what fellowship means,
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.540]   partnership in doing something. But typically if you ask an average person what they feel
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.980]   like they're good in, it's like, "Well I'm good with fellowship." And then the second,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.500]   especially if you attend a Bible teaching church like ours, "I'm good with Word." Because
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.980]   the Word of God is being taught on Sunday, and Bible study, especially in our generation
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.140]   you can just turn on the radio and the Word of God is taught. And so typically it would
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:30.140]   go fellowship, the Word, and then 3 and 4 usually is different based upon what kind
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.380]   of personality you have. So if you happen to be an outgoing person who likes to talk
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.780]   to strangers, you say, "Well evangelism is number 3 because I talk to people." That's
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.580]   evangelism. And then the fourth would be prayer. So if you happen to be an introvert, you may
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.580]   be 3, you know, prayer would be 3, evangelism 4. But whatever it is, it's usually prayer
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:56.580]   is in the bottom half, either 3 or 4. Well if prayer is the most powerful, most significant
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:06.820]   thing that we have gained, to have access to the Father and pray, and yet we find ourselves
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:14.340]   struggling in our prayer, in our disciplines, wouldn't that leave us in despair, frustration,
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:23.220]   maybe even desire to quit? And many people actually end up doing that because, "Well,
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.780]   I have such a hard time praying. In fact, even when I begin to pray, all I can think
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.460]   about is fantasy football or basketball or all these different things that I've watched
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.140]   are playing through my head and all the deadlines and everything that I'm responsible for and
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:43.500]   I have such a hard time praying." And then eventually after a while you just stop praying.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   It almost seems like God knew that you and I were going to struggle. If God left us and
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.580]   said, "Well, you know, all these other things don't matter, but if you just become a powerful
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:02.580]   prayer warrior, then at least that will save you." But that's not what the scripture says.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.340]   In fact, Hebrews 7.25 says, "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:15.340]   who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for us."
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.180]   Christ intercedes on our behalf. And the text that we're looking at this morning says that
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:26.020]   the Holy Spirit joins him in interceding. In Romans 8.26, "The Spirit himself intercedes
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:32.620]   for us with groanings too deep for words." We talked about that word groaning before.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:39.620]   In the RSV, the word for groaning is translated sighing. Sighs too deep for words. If you've
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:49.620]   ever been in a situation where you're not just struggling, you're just like, the pain
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:56.620]   is so deep, the struggle is so intense that you can't even articulate what to pray for.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.180]   And all you can do is sigh. If you've ever been in that situation, you know exactly what
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.060]   he's talking about. There's a groaning and sighing that you can't articulate. And when
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:11.940]   you pray, some of the most deepest, most powerful prayers are without words. And I can remember
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:18.500]   a few times in ministry where the deepest prayers, my prayer life basically was just
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.580]   waking up in the middle of the night just sighing. I don't know if I can keep doing
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.780]   this. Lord, help me. And I remember every single day that was my prayer. It was not
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.500]   calculated. It wasn't something that I said, "I need to pray." It was just something that
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:38.540]   the Holy Spirit, I believe, by putting pressure, just forced me to pray in that way. And some
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   of you, again, may have been in a situation where your prayer was just sighing and groaning.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.980]   The word that is translated says it was without words. Literally, it's just one word. It means
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   "wordless." The prayers that are offered up on our behalf by the Holy Spirit are wordless.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:05.420]   It is just groaning. Again, if you've ever been in that situation, you know what that
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.980]   prayer feels like. You don't know what it sounds like, but you know what that prayer
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.360]   feels like. And you have to, that's not something that you can just generate. That's something
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.300]   that happens to you. That prayer comes as a result of the pressure that God places upon
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   your life. It just happens. But that prayer is an intense prayer. It's a passionate prayer.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:34.380]   Typically when we pray, a lot of times, a lot of our prayers are this type of prayer.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.740]   We're not Catholic, so we don't do this, right? But a lot of our prayer is no different than
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:44.780]   that. Beans and rice in Jesus Christ. Usually when we pray, you may not say beans and rice
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:50.080]   in Jesus Christ, but a lot of your prayers for your food is kimchi and fried rice in
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.580]   Jesus Christ, or boba and chicken in Jesus Christ. So basically, there's not a lot of
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.540]   thought that goes into it. It's just, "Thank you for this food. Thank you for this day
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.960]   in Jesus' name. Amen." So a lot of our prayers, and not just for food, but when we pray for
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.980]   certain situations, it's your time to pray. So you just kind of have some rote things
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.840]   that you say in prayer. But these are not intense, thought out, groaning and crying
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   out to God. See, when the Bible describes the Holy Spirit praying, it is not this, you
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.940]   know, not thought out, just kind of rote prayer that He just kind of offers up and saying
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:32.940]   His duty, He just did His job. Groaning typically is a deep-seated desire, passionate, and it
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:41.460]   is consistent with the way that the Bible describes the way God pursued us. The Bible
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:47.660]   describes our God as a jealous God. He didn't just casually pursue us. He didn't just look
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:53.060]   at the world and say, "Ah, I feel pity for them, so let's do this one thing." His passion
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.660]   for lost sinners like you and me was so passionate, was so jealous, that He would even offer up
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   His only begotten Son to pursue us. So when we think about His love, it is really beyond
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:13.980]   anything that you and I could possibly imagine. If somebody was to create a story, wanted
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.020]   to make a movie about the greatest love that human beings ever could imagine, we wouldn't
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.860]   imagine this, because it wouldn't make any sense. Because you've never experienced it,
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.940]   you've never seen it. Even the greatest love of a mother toward their child, it's beyond
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.780]   that. So just because it is beyond us, we wouldn't imagine this. And yet the Scripture
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:39.940]   describes the love that He has for sinners like us, to pursue us. It's that deep, it's
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:46.100]   that passionate. So it only makes sense that the Holy Spirit who intercedes on our behalf
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.380]   is groaning in the same way. You may have experienced that type of groaning, but the
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.180]   question I have for you is, have you ever prayed for someone else with that type of
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.540]   groaning? That type of sighing. You might have sighed for yourself, maybe God put pressure
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:08.540]   on you, but what did you care about so much? It may be somebody that you loved. Maybe the
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.900]   pain for somebody else that you're watching from a distance was so intense that you may
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:21.900]   have groaned and sighed. But it needs to be intense. You're not going to groan and sigh
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.500]   from a distance nonchalantly. It is only because it was so intense that you may have prayed,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.660]   if you've ever done that for somebody else. See, that's how the Bible describes our relationship
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.940]   with God, that our God jealously pursued us, willing to even send His only begotten Son.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.500]   So the prayers that are offered up on our behalf by the Holy Spirit is described as
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   a sighing, this groaning, wordless on our behalf constantly. And it is this groaning
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:03.140]   that our Father hears. If you've ever been in a hospital setting, or maybe somebody in
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:09.580]   your family was so sick, and there was so much pain and discomfort that you hear groaning,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.580]   and if you hear this groaning, your first reaction is, "God, do something. Hurry up
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.300]   and get the nurses or the doctors. We have to help this person relieve their suffering."
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.700]   That's the image I get when I hear this term groaning, that the Holy Spirit is groaning
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.820]   on behalf of His adopted children. And so the prayers that God hears is this groaning
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.820]   and sighing on our behalf. So no matter how far we fall short, the reason why we have
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:47.220]   assurance of salvation is not because you are strong. It is not because you are determined.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.180]   It is not because you know theology better than the next guy. The reason why we have
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:19:00.180]   assurance of salvation is because the Holy Spirit that has been implanted in us is groaning,
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:08.140]   and our Father is listening to the groaning of the Holy Spirit on our behalf, interceding.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.300]   That's why we have assurance of salvation. That's why He can say with all confidence
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.940]   that He guards and He protects the inheritance that He entrusted to us. It is by His power,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.780]   by His faithfulness, because He's referring to the Holy Spirit that is groaning on our
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.420]   behalf. The text that we're looking at, verse 26, in these two verses, we're given maybe
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:35.380]   about three or four insights that I want to highlight for you guys to understand this
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:41.220]   ministry of the Holy Spirit in intercession. He begins in verse 826 by saying, "Likewise,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:47.380]   the Spirit helps us in our weakness." The reason why the Holy Spirit was given to us
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   is because He says He understands our weakness. Hebrews 4 to 15, it says, "For we do not have
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:04.100]   a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but one who in every respect
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:11.100]   has been tempted as we are yet without sin." He doesn't understand our weakness from a
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.420]   distance. He stepped in our shoes and He understands it from first-hand knowledge, the weakness
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.700]   that you and I experience. See, the strangest scene that you see in the Scripture when you
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.940]   really understand the totality, the context of Jesus' incarnation, which we're going to
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:34.660]   be celebrating in a few weeks. When Jesus comes into the ministry, the very first scene
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.940]   in His ministry after the baptism is He's led out into the desert for 40 days He's tempted.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:45.780]   At the end of the 40 days, Satan comes and tempts Him, saying, "If you would bow down
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:52.780]   to me, I will give you all that you see." Imagine the ridiculous proposition that is,
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:21:00.340]   that Satan, a created being, is tempting the Creator that, "If you would bow down to me,
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.660]   I will give you all that you have created, and I will give that to you." I mean, you
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:12.660]   look at the context of that, you say, "Ridiculous. Is Satan stupid? Is Satan really stupid that
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.620]   he would approach the Son of God and think that somehow that's going to be a temptation?
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.620]   That you give me your bicycle, right, you give me your Lamborghini and I will give you
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:30.620]   my bicycle. Is that a temptation? Why did Satan even tempt to come to Jesus with that
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:37.380]   proposition? There was something about His incarnation, there was something about His
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:44.180]   weakness in taking on human form. For the first time that Satan has been challenging
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:51.060]   the God of the universe to usurp His authority and glory, for the first time he saw weakness
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:58.060]   in Jesus' humanity that if there was any time that Satan had any chance of taking over His
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:06.180]   throne, it may have been now. And that's what Satan was targeting. It was something about
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:14.060]   His humanity where the scripture says that He left His glory and He took on human form,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.300]   and He understands our weakness because He stood there with us. You know, another strange
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:25.180]   scene is right before He goes to the cross, He's praying, and He's wrestling, and He says,
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:32.180]   "Lord God, if there is another way, if there is another way." Now think about that prayer.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.620]   All of Old Testament history, all of Israel's history, all of everything that God has been
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.100]   doing that we recorded in scripture is about the coming of Jesus Christ and what He was
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:50.100]   about to do the next morning. Jesus was born for that purpose, whole purpose of ministry.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.420]   He's been prophesying to His disciples that He's going to be crucified and resurrected,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:01.140]   and yet the night before that happens He prays, "Is there another way?" See, it was something
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.660]   about His humanity. That's exactly how every weak human being would react, knowing the
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:12.040]   suffering that was going to come. The physical suffering, the spiritual pain, being separated
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   from the Father. There's something about His humanity that He took on weakness, all for
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:28.140]   what purpose? So that He can be a sympathetic high priest. See, our Savior has an intimate
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.980]   knowledge of our weakness, and He knows. And that's why when the disciples were praying,
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.540]   even as He told them that He's going to be crucified, "Couldn't you stay up with me one
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.580]   hour? Your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak." Jesus knew that they were going
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:54.580]   to be weak. Our assurance of salvation would have been utterly destroyed if it wasn't for
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:04.020]   the fact that our Father already knew that we were weak. See, first and foremost, He
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:12.020]   sent the Holy Spirit because we were weak, because He knew we would struggle. And our
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.660]   confidence comes, not because of you, not because of me, not because of our background
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.820]   or experience, because in our weakness He sent the Holy Spirit. See, Scripture says,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:30.820]   "Remember, when Jesus saw the multitudes, He had compassion." You know the word "compassion"
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.540]   in the Greek is a very intense word. It means to have your bowels. I mean, today, you know,
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:41.300]   we use that term for different purposes. But the term that is used in Greek is kind of
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.180]   like being punched in the gut. If you've ever experienced being punched in the gut, and
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:51.020]   I hope you haven't, but if you've ever had an experience being punched in the gut, you
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:57.660]   can't think straight. You can't breathe. You can't concentrate on anything. It is something
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   that requires all of your attention. You will kneel to the ground until you can gain sobriety.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.420]   That's what it does when you get punched in the gut. The word for "compassion" in Greek
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.460]   means that when Jesus saw the multitude, it was like He was punched in the gut and He
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   was moved with emotion, with compassion. And He immediately turns around and compassion
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:27.460]   He says, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few." He saw them, He says, "They
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:34.340]   are like sheep without shepherd, harassed and helpless." What that means is, without
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:40.780]   the Holy Spirit, that's exactly who you and I would be, harassed and helpless. He told
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.220]   the disciples when He was about to leave, "If you go, what about us?" And Jesus said,
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.580]   "I will not leave you as orphans." And then He promises the Holy Spirit. So what that
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:55.140]   means is, without the Holy Spirit, you and I would be helpless and harassed and like
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:01.580]   orphans with no help. But that is not the way He left us. We have assurance of salvation
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:08.580]   because the Holy Spirit is interceding, groaning and sighing on our behalf. Second observation
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.140]   is that the Spirit helps us because there are times that we don't even know what to
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:21.140]   pray for. Sometimes it's difficult to pray because we sit down and we try to pray. We're
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:27.780]   not even sure what to pray for. Should I pray for safety? Should I pray for strength? Should
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:33.140]   I pray to move on? Should I pray to persevere? And sometimes we don't even know. But He says
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.820]   that even because we do not know, He says, "For we do not know what to pray for as we
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us." He intercedes because we don't even know
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:50.020]   how to pray or what to pray at times. The whole book of Job is a description of this
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.020]   righteous man who couldn't understand why is God doing this? Why is suffering coming?
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.180]   So each one of his friends are coming in three separate cycles telling him, "Let me tell
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.660]   you the answer." And every single one of them were not only wrong, but it made matters worse
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.140]   because they were wrong. And Job is trying to understand through all of this suffering
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:19.140]   what is going on, what is going on. We see that in Elijah, this man of God after confronting
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:26.460]   these bald priests and having this victory, instead of seeing revival come, Jezebel is
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:33.460]   even more determined to continue this evil. And he's burned out and tired and he's escaping
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.980]   into the desert because he doesn't understand. "I've given everything I've got. You've demonstrated
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.220]   your power publicly. And instead of revival, they're trying to kill me because he didn't
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.340]   understand." There's a lot of things that happen in our life that we don't fully get,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:56.660]   that we don't understand. We don't even know how to pray. Not only are we weak in our flesh,
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:03.660]   we don't even know what to pray for. But the hope that we have is that the Holy Spirit
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:10.700]   who is sighing and groaning on our behalf, He knows. That's where we have assurance.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:20.100]   It's not because of the great church that you're at. It's not because of the great friends
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:26.000]   you're surrounded by. It's not because of your talent, whatever background, whatever
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   gifting you may have. It's because in our weakness and in our lostness, He gave us the
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.260]   Holy Spirit to guarantee. Thirdly, the reason why the Holy Spirit intercedes is because
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.660]   He's the best person to intercede for us. He says, "The Father knows the mind of the
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:52.660]   Spirit and the Spirit knows the will of God." John chapter 15 verse 7, it says, "If you
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.880]   abide in my word, my word abides in you. Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.820]   But sometimes we don't even know what the will of God is. In fact, one of the most common
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:09.800]   questions that I get as a pastor is, "What is His will?" So how can we pray according
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   to His will when at times we're just lost? If you want to know what I like to eat, ask
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.400]   Esther. Esther knows me better than anybody else, at least now as an adult. I spend the
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.240]   most time with her. So if you want to know where I am Wednesday at 3 o'clock, she's
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:35.760]   the best person to ask. She's my best ambassador. You know, it wasn't always like that. When
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.520]   we first got married, a lot of the marriage problems comes because we don't understand
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   each other. I would come home and her sadness, annoyance, tired, angry, all looked the same
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.560]   to me. And you can imagine what kind of trouble you're going to get into. You walk home, it's
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.360]   like, "Why are you angry?" She might have just been tired. And she's like, "I'm just
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.000]   tired." "Why are you treating me like this?" And then it would turn into, "She's angry
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.520]   because I got angry and then I'm angry because now she's really angry." And then that starts
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.040]   to fight, right? So it wasn't about anything other than I misread her. The good thing about
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   being married for a long time is that communication is a lot easier. And sometimes we laugh about
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:28.920]   it because I spend the most time with Esther. And so after almost 25 years, I can fidget
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:36.120]   a certain way and she knows, "Oh, you're thirsty." We'd be driving in the car and even before
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   I'm about to fall asleep, she'll say, "You're tired. Pull over." Like, "Wow, I didn't even
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   swerve." I remember one time I was driving and I don't know, I was thinking about something
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:01.000]   that was making me mad. And I was just driving by myself and I'm just, I mean, with her in
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   the car and then she looked over and she's like, "What's wrong with you?" I said, "I'm
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   not mad." I said, "What do you mean?" She's like, "You look like you're going to kill
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:17.640]   somebody." I said, "She read my thoughts." And that's the benefit of being married for
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   a long time. Like the communication becomes a lot easier. I walk in, I can tell the distinction.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   There's no better person to represent us before God than the Holy Spirit. Not only does He
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.560]   sigh on our behalf, if He doesn't know who we are and if He doesn't know who the Father
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.280]   is, His prayer would be like ours. It would just kind of miss. He's saying things that
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.440]   really doesn't matter. It's not according to His will. But nobody knows the mind of
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   the Spirit better than the Father. And nobody knows the will of God than the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:59.720]   And that Holy Spirit that is indwelling in us is sighing passionately and groaning on
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   our behalf constantly. That's where our eternal security comes from. Not you, not me. That
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:17.480]   even in our weakness, He knew our weakness. He gave us His Son. That's why our prayers
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:27.200]   in accordance to the Spirit is effective. In the Old Testament, you had Moses who represented
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.920]   the nation of Israel and God to the nation of Israel. But at the end of his life, because
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:39.280]   he didn't represent God as holy, because he was a human being. And he was disqualified
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:45.120]   into entering the Promised Land. Every single prophet that spoke on behalf of God was a
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   human being. Also under the bondage of sin. And even the high priest, he could only enter
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:59.280]   the Holy of Holies once a year because he himself was sinful. Only the Holy Spirit can
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:06.880]   be in the presence of the Father and know His will perfectly and His will known perfectly.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.640]   And that is why He doesn't need to speak. His prayers are groaning and sighing without
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   words because God knows Him. And that Holy Spirit is indwelling in us. And God answers
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   that prayer. God answers that prayer. So next question we have to ask is the Holy Spirit
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.800]   is interceding for us. And that's where our confidence assurance comes from. What is He
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.200]   sighing for? What is He groaning about on our behalf? Well, it's stated in John chapter
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.800]   17. So turn your Bibles with me to John chapter 17. I'm not going to read the whole text,
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.920]   but John chapter 17 is called the priestly prayer, high priestly prayer. Jesus is praying
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.060]   and He's praying deliberately and publicly so that people can hear. So that we would
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.660]   understand that as Jesus intercedes on our behalf this is what He is praying. So I'm
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.340]   not going to read all of it, but the first section of it He basically says, "Now is the
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.940]   time for Me to glorify you and for you to glorify the Son." And He's talking about the
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.420]   cross. So the first part of the prayer is between Him and the Father and how His whole
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   ministry was to glorify Him and how He's come to save mankind to honor and glorify the Father.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.740]   But the section that I want to read to you starting from verse 13 where His prayers turn
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:30.940]   directly to us. And this gives us a glimpse of what the Holy Spirit is groaning and sighing
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:37.180]   for and this is what He says in verse 13. John chapter 17, 13. "But now I am coming to
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:42.300]   you and these things I speak in the world that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves."
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   So let me stop right there. Remember we talked about that joy and Zoe, life, go hand in hand.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.380]   He's not just saying biologically that we're going to exist forever, but He's talking about
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:35:00.100]   this separation from the author of life to be alive, to make us alive again, Zoe. So
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.660]   when He says to make My joy fulfilled in them, He's talking about to give them life and give
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:10.780]   this life abundantly. So first and foremost He's praying for our life, verse 14. "I have
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.260]   given them Your Word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world just
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:21.040]   as I am not of the world." So stop right there. He recognizes that because they become followers
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.600]   of Christ that persecution and hardship is going to come into their life. That difficulty
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.340]   is going to come because they're living in this world, but they're not of this world.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.460]   But look at verse 15. He doesn't pray for deliverance, verse 15. "I do not ask that
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.180]   you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one." So He prays
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.540]   for life and He prays and recognizes that suffering is going to come as a result of
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.940]   being a Christian. Not despite, but because you're a Christian. You no longer belong to
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:58.460]   this world. The things that this world runs to for comfort, it is no longer yours. And
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   as a result of that, there's going to be trials and difficulty and suffering. He recognizes
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.500]   that, but He doesn't pray that they would be taken out of the world. In other words,
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.620]   He's not praying that that suffering would stop. That's what He means that He's not,
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.140]   I'm not praying that they would be out of this world. He says, "I ask that you would
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:23.360]   protect them from the evil one." In other words, that they would persevere. When the
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.620]   attack comes, when the suffering comes, that you give them enough strength to persevere
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.940]   through these trials. And then verse 16, "that they are not of the world just as I am not
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:40.660]   of the world. Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." So let's recap what
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:46.780]   He is saying. What is the Holy Spirit sighing and groaning intensely on our behalf? Who
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:53.780]   knows the will of God perfectly and is praying perfectly according to His will. What is He
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:37:00.940]   praying for? Our salvation, joy. He's praying that suffering that will come because we are
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.860]   Christians, that He doesn't pray for us to be delivered from that, but to persevere in
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:11.820]   it so that our faith will not fail, to protect us from the evil one. And then third, that
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:19.260]   we will be sanctified in the process. He's praying for our salvation and our own sanctification
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:27.980]   above your safety, above your comfort. That's what the Holy Spirit is groaning on our behalf.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:34.500]   If you pray and your prayer is contradicting the Holy Spirit's groaning in you, guess which
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:43.660]   prayer is going to be answered? Beans and rice in Jesus Christ or the groaning of the
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:51.940]   Holy Spirit? Groaning of the Holy Spirit is being answered by our Father. The sighing
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:58.260]   of the Holy Spirit, wanting us to be saved, wanting us to persevere through hardship because
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:07.340]   we're Christians and to sanctify us. That pressure that you feel in your life, that
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:13.460]   you're trying so hard to escape from, may have been an answer to the prayers of the
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:21.820]   Holy Spirit in you. Because God desires sanctification in your life more than anything else because
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:28.740]   it is in sanctification that you are connected to the author of this life. But his prayer
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.380]   doesn't stop there. His prayer goes on, verse 18, "As you sent me into the world, so I have
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.140]   sent them into the world. And for their sake, I consecrate myself that they also may be
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.220]   sanctified in truth." And then he says in verse 20, "I do not ask for these only, but
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:49.380]   also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one." And
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:55.580]   finally, not only our salvation, not only our perseverance and sanctification, but that
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.900]   God would use us to continue to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. That is what is being
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:11.780]   prayed on our behalf, morning, day, and night. And it is in answer to that prayer that God
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:21.820]   is acting in your life. And he says, "If you pray, if you abide in me, my words abide in
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:30.260]   you. Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you." You know, when my oldest son, Jeremy,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.180]   when he was younger, he was in high school, you know, Esther and I, there was a period
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:40.300]   when we would go out on campus together to share the gospel. Well, Jeremy would have,
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.900]   you know, certain periods of the day he was off, and he'd say, "Hey, what are you guys
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.180]   doing?" I'd say, "Oh, we're going to go, you know, go on campus and share the gospel."
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:53.180]   And Jeremy said, "Can I come?" So I said, "Why?" You know, he's never asked us this
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.860]   before. He said, "Can I come?" I said, "Well, you know, we're going to share the gospel."
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:04.160]   He said, "Yeah, I want to join you." So Esther and I were like, "Is this our son?" And obviously
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.740]   we were elated. You know, this is the reason why Esther and I got married. We're in ministry,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.540]   we're doing this together. And so our son, when he wanted to come and he joined Esther
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.620]   to go on campus to share the gospel, I mean, to this day, and that's why I'm using it as
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.060]   an illustration because he was, I mean, it just made us so happy that he wanted to do
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.640]   this with us. Now, he didn't know it at that time, but he could have literally asked for
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:37.980]   anything at that time, and I would have given it to him. If he said, "Dad, I need new shoes
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:44.860]   because I need to go on campus. My shoes are dirty, you know, and I want to represent Christ
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:52.380]   in clean shoes." I would have said, "Yes, my son, you need clean shoes." Right? "Oh,
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.100]   the car, I don't know if it's going to make it. You know, I need a car that's going to
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.340]   take me there so I don't, the car doesn't, the engine doesn't shut down halfway there.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.580]   So I need to make sure that I get there on time to share the gospel." I'd say, "Yes,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:11.700]   which car do you need, son? Make sure that you get there." Right? He could have asked
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:24.180]   anything at that moment. He didn't know it, and that time has passed now. But he tapped
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:32.620]   into the core of what makes Esther and myself happy. But once he tapped into that, he could
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:38.380]   have asked anything. See, when the Scripture says, "If you abide in me, my words abide
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:45.860]   in you," our Father is eager to answer our prayers. But He wants to answer our prayers
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.500]   to what is best for you, and that's the Holy Spirit that He's entrusted and is groaning
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.580]   on our behalf. Now, you can hear all of this, "Oh, thank God we have the Holy Spirit. Now
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.260]   we don't need to pray, because since we have an advocate praying on our behalf, perfectly
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:06.540]   know the mind of God." Right? You may think that, but I believe a genuine response to
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:14.060]   this is to live up to the calling that you have received. See, if God left it up to you,
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:23.140]   you would be defeated, anxious, maybe even wanting to quit. The reason why we can persevere
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:29.820]   in our prayers, the reason why we can persevere in our walk with God, that despite our weakness,
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:36.540]   God understands who we are. And that's why He's given to us salvation, gave to us the
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:43.980]   Holy Spirit, gave to us the intercessor, so that we can get up and keep going. I made
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:51.420]   you my children, now live up to it. Now live and use the things that I have given you.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:57.700]   It is interesting that in the midst of all of this, even with the Holy Spirit, even all
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:03.220]   that He fulfills, and even though it is all in Him, beginning, middle, and the end, and
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:11.660]   yet God responds to prayer, if not ours, the Holy Spirit's. So imagine what our life would
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:18.500]   be like if we actually joined the Holy Spirit in that prayer. How pleased our Father would
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:25.900]   be. How honored and glorified our Father would be if we joined the Holy Spirit to pray for
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:32.940]   the things that He is already sighing and groaning for. As we remember and celebrate
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.620]   the coming of Christ, and I know there's a lot of busyness and exchanging gifts and all
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:45.220]   of that stuff is great, you know, but let's take some time to remember what it is that
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:52.060]   we have in Christ. That we don't just let it pass. That we think and meditate and really
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.660]   thank Him and glorify Him and worship Him for what He has given. Let's take some time
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:06.540]   to pray as our worship team comes up. Again, as our worship team comes up, I want to encourage
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:16.660]   you, take some time to meditate and think through. Maybe some of you guys are that person
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.980]   that I described in the beginning, frustration. You know, feel like you're repeating the cycle
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:27.020]   over and over again, not making progress. Maybe just take your eyes off of yourself
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.540]   for a minute and just thank God for what He has given. That in our weakness, He gave us
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:38.900]   the Holy Spirit. That even when we are weak, there's prayers being offered up on your behalf.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:45.240]   And to really come before the Lord in thankfulness and take some time to meditate and to refocus
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.420]   as our worship team leads us.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   You
