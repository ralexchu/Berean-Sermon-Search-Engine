[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 4, and I'm going to read again 7 through
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.560]   11, just so that we'll be familiar with the text that we're in this morning.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.360]   Hebrews chapter 4, verses 7 through 11.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560]   And again, this is the NASB.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.360]   "Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.840]   your hearts as when they provoked me, as in the day of trial in the wilderness, where
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.680]   your fathers tried me by testing me, and saw my works for forty years.'
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.800]   Therefore I was angry with this generation and said, 'They always go astray in their
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.240]   heart, and they did not know my ways.'
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.520]   As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest."
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.480]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.960]   Patience and loving Father, we are gathered here together because we want to hear from
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.280]   you, not from man's experience, man's knowledge.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.240]   We pray, Father God, that it is your word that is exposited, it is your word that goes
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   forth, it is your word that would convict us and lead us.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840]   We entrust this time to you, Lord God, as you've given us the privilege to gather together
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.880]   as a corporate body.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   We genuinely desire to worship you in spirit and in truth, so we ask for your help.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.520]   Help us, Lord God, to put behind whatever things that we've entangled ourselves with,
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.920]   Lord, before we've come into this room.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.680]   May this time be truly sacred, that we may hear from you and to receive grace and mercy.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.280]   We ask for your blessing, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   Without having to show with hands, just kind of a rhetorical question for you to just think
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.280]   about, how many of you are working in the field that you study?
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.800]   So if you did go to college, how many of you are actually in the field that you study?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   And no, no, you don't know, don't raise your hand.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440]   How many of you have changed your major at least once while you were in school?
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.080]   Again, don't raise your hand, I would just want to think about it, okay.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   National statistics is 80% of college students change their major at least once before they
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   graduate, 80%, right?
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680]   That's quite a few people.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.320]   33% work in fields that didn't need a college degree at all, right?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:31.160]   33% are actually working long-term in a job that didn't require a college degree at all.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   Only 27% work in the field that they've actually studied.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.000]   That means 73% of the people are working in fields that had nothing to do with their major.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.080]   So whether you spent four years or five years in your studies, whatever you're doing, maybe
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.360]   it got you through the door, but really didn't train you for whatever it was that you're
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   doing.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.000]   Now, all of this is not to say college is useless, right?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.360]   That's not my point, right?
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.720]   But why is that?
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   Why do so many students come in and some point in their career, they end up changing their
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   major?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.640]   Well, I mean, there could be a lot of explanation, but the simplest explanation is when you first
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.320]   came in, you didn't really know what you wanted.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.560]   So you probably were told when you were younger, you'd be a great engineer, you'd be a great
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.080]   scientist, you'd be a great doctor, and then once you start studying, you realize that
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.920]   this is not you.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.280]   And maybe from the pressure from home, because you did certain things, or maybe because you've
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   already invested two years of your life into it and you couldn't change for whatever the
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.440]   reason when you first came in, more than 80%, like not once, more than once changed their
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.800]   major and by the time they graduate, even then they're not exactly sure because very
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.960]   small percentage of people just graduate and end up doing exactly what they studied.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.100]   The reason why I mention this is because so much of our Christian life reflect what we
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.040]   do with our majors.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.200]   So many people who grew up in the church, the statistics is, at least for the younger
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   group, 80% and it matches the number of students who actually changed their major.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.840]   80% of students who grew up in the church, sometime during their college career, they
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.640]   end up drifting away from their faith and they abandon their faith completely by the
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   time they graduate.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.440]   80% of people who graduated from college, who are actively involved in campus ministries,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.600]   80% of them, by the time they get into their careers and they're young adults and they
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   settle down, 80% of them also fall away and they no longer walk with the Lord.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.440]   So if you calculate, I don't know the exact math in that, but I don't have the statistics
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.560]   above that, but if you calculate, the majority of the people who grew up in the church are
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.880]   walking away from their faith.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   Why is this taking place?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.960]   Now, we can have all kinds of studies and sociologists and church planters and evangelists,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.400]   theologians have been studying for years what causes all of this, but in the end, this is
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.720]   not unique to younger people.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.160]   I don't know the numbers of how many people fall away after they get married, but from
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   my observation from years of doing ministry with this group, I can tell you it is high.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.920]   There are, again, I don't know the exact number, but people who get married and then after
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.360]   they have children, what percentage of them are persevering and fervently pursuing the
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   Lord?
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.080]   I don't know the number for that either, but I know it's pretty high.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.800]   The confusing part of that is once you pass a certain point, when they walk away from
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.880]   their faith, they don't walk away from the church.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.040]   They still remain in the church.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   You can be apostate, at least where you and I are.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.240]   In every way, there is no personal relationship with Christ.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.120]   There is no faith driving them anymore.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.240]   It's more sociology.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's more because that's what you studied, that was the pressure, you've invested too
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.680]   much, so it's too late to turn around, so this is my lot in life and you just end up
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.960]   going because to forfeit your faith by physically walking away from the church, you have too
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.280]   many friendships, family ties, your whole social interaction is all centered around
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.400]   Christianity and the church.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.640]   And so some people physically walk away, many people stay in the church, and yet their life
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.320]   has nothing to do with their faith.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.780]   It just happens to be the culture of the church.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.720]   This warning that is given in Hebrews chapter 3 is not unique to the book of Hebrews.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.900]   All throughout scripture, there is this warning not to drift.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.960]   We looked at last week about these traits of apostasy, and the reason why it's important
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.840]   for us to look at that is because every single one of us needs to be sober as to the message
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   of what he is saying.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   Last week, we looked about how he said, the first one, "Today, if you hear his voice,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   do not harden your heart."
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Today.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.720]   Apostasy, oftentimes in the church, begins with delayed obedience.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.620]   And the reason why that's so confusing is because when there is delayed obedience, it
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.040]   doesn't feel like disobedience.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.360]   Even though our hearts have drifted away from God and we're no longer walking with him,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.620]   we never say no.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.900]   We never deny Christ.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   It's just delayed.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.580]   And so when we delay our obedience, it is disobedience.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.820]   That's the first step to apostasy.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.660]   And secondly, when there is delayed obedience, which in God's eyes is disobedience, it causes
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   our hearts to be hardened toward God.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.100]   And that's why he says, "Today, if you hear his voice."
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.340]   If the voice of God makes any sense, if God convicts you and softens your heart and calls
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.380]   you to himself, and you say, "Not now."
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.380]   Tomorrow may not be there.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.060]   Physically, you may not be there.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.760]   Spiritually, you may not be in the same place.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.380]   And God may not be calling you.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.400]   God is not somebody that you can turn on and off whenever you are ready.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.380]   He says that when you, when God calls you today, today do not harden your heart.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   Last week I said there was five.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.640]   I actually condensed it into two.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.560]   So today we're going to be looking at the third and the fourth one.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   Step to apostasy.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.980]   One, delayed obedience.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.220]   Two, hardened heart.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.160]   And three, a heart that strays away from God.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.340]   In verse 10, "They always go astray in their hearts and they did not know my ways."
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.260]   In Psalm 78, 7 through 8, it describes this hardened heart.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.600]   And again, it's a description of what happened to the nation of Israel.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.180]   That they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God, but keep
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.780]   his commandments and not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.540]   that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.740]   What does it mean that they didn't prepare their hearts?
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:03.580]   The Hebrew word for prepare, kun, literally means to make firm, to establish, or to make
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.580]   steadfast.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:12.900]   That word is described in establishing an object, founding of a city, adjusting a weapon
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.240]   toward its target, or making something ready or ordaining something for something specific.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   So in other words, the word kun, to prepare, basically means to establish the foundation
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.980]   to prepare it for whatever work that you're trying to do.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.040]   So if you're shooting a weapon, you're targeting, you're making sure before you pull the trigger
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.240]   that it's ready.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.020]   The Bible describes something similar to this when it says to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:43.580]   It means to allow yourself, to let yourself to be filled, to establish, to prepare your
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.580]   heart.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:51.660]   And so what he is saying is, when the trials and testing comes, if you have not prepared
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.000]   your heart, it will reveal what your heart is filled with.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.340]   And so because they did not prepare their heart, they didn't establish their heart toward
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.960]   God, when they were squeezed, it immediately showed what was inside.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.680]   It said that they were constantly going astray, they were constantly grumbling against God.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.540]   And again, this is given to us as an example, a negative example not to follow.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:26.540]   Now just in case that we think that God sent them out and at the first sign of some grumbling,
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.940]   God said enough and he squashed them.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.560]   We need to understand the context of what God says here.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   When he says he was provoked and he swore to himself that they would not enter the rest,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.320]   when he was angry with them, it was not a knee-jerk reaction, that he didn't tolerate
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   it at all.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.600]   In fact, whenever we look at the Old Testament, people typically think, when you look at it
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.560]   superficially, God is a God of harsh judgment and righteousness in the Old Testament, and
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.640]   God is a God of mercy and grace in the New Testament.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.240]   Because on the surface, we talk about the cross and how Jesus forgives our sins, and
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   he's merciful.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.780]   And then we look at the Old Testament, how he gave the law, and when the Israelites rebelled,
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.960]   God punished them.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.560]   But when you dig deeper, you'll find that the God of the Old Testament and the God of
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.040]   the New Testament is exactly the same.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.280]   That the God of the New Testament is just as righteous, just as holy as the God of the
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.560]   Old Testament, and the God of the Old Testament is just as gracious and mercy as the God of
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   the New Testament.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.720]   And the reason why is because it's the same God.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.280]   I want to go over with you the brief history, just through the book of Exodus and Numbers,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   because this text is based upon that period of experience.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.480]   Exodus chapter 3, 7 through 8.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.040]   This is the beginning of God responding and deliverance to the nation of Israel.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.520]   This is what he says.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.280]   The Lord said, "I have surely seen the afflictions of my people who are in Egypt, and have given
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.680]   heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.720]   So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them up
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.920]   from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey."
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.080]   So remember, this is the beginning of God responding and showing mercy to the nation
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   of Israel.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.420]   They cried out to God in their affliction.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.580]   In their suffering, he has mercy on them, and he begins this process by establishing
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.440]   Moses to go have a power encounter with Pharaoh, and then through that process, he would deliver
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   them to the nation of Israel, and then take them to the land filled with milk and honey.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.540]   That was his plan.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:36.760]   But all of this was started, at least that period, because they cried out to God in their
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.500]   affliction.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.840]   The grumbling doesn't take long.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   They're not years into the desert before the grumbling happens.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:55.720]   Moses is sent, and he says, "My God, Yahweh, told me to tell you to let my people go, so
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.840]   that they may go out and worship."
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.480]   Pharaoh hardened his heart, and he said, "These people, it's because maybe they have too much
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.760]   time to go out and worship."
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   So he makes it harder for them.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.240]   He makes the work harder for them.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.960]   And as soon as they got squeezed, in Exodus chapter 5, verse 21, "They said to them, 'May
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.800]   the Lord look upon you and judge you.'"
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.120]   He's talking to Moses and Aaron.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   "'May the Lord look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.'"
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   So right off the bat, as soon as things got a little bit difficult, right, they cried
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.000]   out to God.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.920]   They are the ones who cried out to God in their suffering.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   "Lord, where are you?
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   Help me."
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.560]   And when God answers and sends Moses, initially they probably thought, "Wow, Moses.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   God sends Moses."
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.480]   But as soon as Pharaoh puts a little bit of squeeze, they turn on Moses.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.680]   "What are you doing making our life hard?"
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.280]   Well, God is patient and He's merciful.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.720]   He has a power encounter.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.160]   Basically He has a power encounter with the 10 plagues, right?
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.080]   And He shows great power to the nation of Israel and Pharaoh, and they are delivered.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   And as a result, the Pharaoh lets them go.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.200]   But as they are going, they run into the Red Sea.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.800]   And they begin to be fearful.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.560]   We come all the way out here, and what if Pharaoh is going to come and he comes and
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   kills us?
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.480]   So they hear that Pharaoh changed his mind, and now that he's coming after them.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.720]   And this is what he says in Exodus 14, 11-12.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.840]   The nation of Israel, then they said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.240]   that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?"
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.880]   Again, they're complaining to Moses.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.560]   "Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.300]   Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt saying, 'Leave us alone that we may
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.800]   serve the Egyptians?'"
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.880]   Where did they say that?
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.040]   They cried out to God, begging for God to deliver them.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.480]   But as soon as they got squeezed, they have a completely different view of what happened.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.600]   We never want deliverance.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   Why are you coming?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.360]   "Leave us alone," they said, "for it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.600]   than to die in the wilderness."
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.520]   God doesn't squash them.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.880]   You would think by this time, "Really?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.380]   After everything that I've done, after all the miracles that I've shown you, after sparing
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:21.960]   your children and delivering you from Pharaoh himself because you're scared?"
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   God is gracious.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.520]   He opens up the Red Sea.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   And you know the story.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.240]   They come after him, and they cover.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.320]   They're on the other side, and they're so elated by God's mercy and grace, they break
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.800]   out in song.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.240]   Moses actually writes a song, and the whole nation of Israel is partying it up.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.000]   So you would think that the rest of their journey in the wilderness would be reflecting
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.160]   upon their delivery.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:52.920]   Three days, three days after being delivered through the Red Sea, they begin to grumble.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.280]   Exodus chapter 15, 24.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.160]   So the people grumbled to Moses saying, "What shall we drink?
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.760]   We had all that water.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.040]   You know, now we're over here.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.440]   We're thirsty.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.880]   What is this about?"
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.440]   God doesn't squash them.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.680]   He leads them into these 12 springs.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   Not only are they drinking, their animals are drinking, their children are swimming.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.320]   And you would think, "Wow, even after all of that, God doesn't squash them, and he leads
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.760]   them to the spring."
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:30.640]   Exactly one month later, about five, six weeks later, Exodus chapter 16, 2-3.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.160]   The whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.820]   The sons of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the Lord's hand in the land
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:45.520]   of Egypt, when we sat by the post of meat, when we ate bread to full, for you have brought
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.720]   us up out of the wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.040]   So now that our thirst is taken care about, what about our stomach?
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   God doesn't squash them there.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.240]   He gives them manna, miraculous food, manna, for the next 40 years.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   This miraculous food that they're able to pick up from the ground and eat.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.880]   But after a while, they get sick of the manna, and what do they say?
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.560]   "Oh, this is it?
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.120]   All we're going to get is carbohydrates?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.480]   What about some protein?"
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480]   And God doesn't squash them.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.740]   He starts to give them quail.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.140]   So they begin to eat the quail.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.600]   But that's not enough.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.240]   Exodus chapter 17, they grumbled again about the water, because they got thirsty.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.120]   And then you know the story in Exodus chapter 32.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.320]   So they're grumbling and grumbling.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.160]   And by the time Moses goes up to the mountains to receive the law from God, they're like,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.440]   "Where did this guy go?
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.840]   How come he's not here leading us?
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.920]   Where's our God?"
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.520]   And then they come back down, and they're worshiping this gold calf, and they ask Aaron,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.120]   "Aaron, what did you do?"
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.320]   And Aaron's response is almost comical.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.840]   He says, "I put some gold pieces, and I threw it in the fire, and this golden calf came
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.240]   out."
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.220]   And so they wanted to worship, but I was only doing what they wanted.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.560]   And so obviously, God got angry.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.160]   He splits the camp in half.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.920]   If you are for Yahweh, stand here.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.660]   And if you're going to worship this golden calf, you stand over there.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.800]   And God judges them, but He is merciful to those who repent.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.400]   And He continues with them.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.160]   But the complaining doesn't end there.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.560]   Even after that.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.000]   Numbers 11, they complained because they didn't have meat.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   Numbers 12, they complained about Moses.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.520]   Are you the only leader?
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.680]   Has God only speaking through you?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.760]   Numbers chapter 14, 1 through 4, you know what happens there.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.800]   God is preparing them to get into the promised land, and the spies that go in, they come
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.160]   back, and their lack of faith in God again is revealed.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.240]   And this is what they said.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.720]   Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.000]   night.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.280]   All the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.840]   to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would that we had died in this
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   wilderness.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.760]   Why is the Lord bringing us into this land?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.220]   To fall by the sword.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.200]   Our wise and our little ones will become plunder.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.360]   Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?"
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:19.600]   So they said to one another, "Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt."
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.080]   And then Numbers 24 through 5, again it kind of reveals to us in conclusion what they believe.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:30.040]   "Why then have you brought the Lord's assembly into this wilderness for us and our beasts
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   to die here?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.560]   Why have you made us come up from Egypt to bring us into the wretched place?
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.160]   It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink."
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.920]   Oh my gosh.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.320]   Now I've highlighted some of their complaints.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.680]   There's more.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:58.280]   The ones that have risen to be recorded in Exodus and Numbers is because it was an organized
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.160]   grumbling.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:05.000]   But my guess is the grumbling was happening all the time.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.840]   Individually, in the homes, in conversations.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.040]   And every time they got squeezed just a little bit.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   "It's so hot."
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.160]   Because the desert's pretty hot.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   They start moving.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.480]   "Oh, we've got to move again.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.720]   We just settled down."
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.120]   They said, "Only you guys touch the pole."
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.400]   How come only they can do it?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   I'm so tired.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.880]   How come I have to do the heavy lifting?
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.560]   Cows.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   We have to every time we sin, we got to do it.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.760]   Can you imagine?
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.820]   These are just the grumblings that rose up to the top.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:42.880]   But can you imagine the grumbling that was taking place within the camp constantly?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.000]   They kept on testing God, it says.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.400]   Remember last week's passage, it says that God was testing them and instead they turned
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.180]   it around and they began to test God.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.520]   And they tested God in two ways.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.400]   They tested God by demanding God to prove himself worthy of them.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.300]   They turned the tables around and they were constantly examining God.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.880]   Are you going to be faithful enough?
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.480]   Are you gracious enough?
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.240]   Can we put our trust in you?
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.640]   So every time they got squeezed, they turned the tables and they began to get their laser
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.760]   focus at God and said, "Is God really here?"
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.000]   And when they got squeezed, it revealed what was really in their hearts.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.160]   It was not God that they were serving.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.080]   They were serving comfort, they were serving their stomach, they were serving each other,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.220]   and God just played a role in them pursuing what they wanted.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.120]   So when they got squeezed, it was revealed that their real faith was not in God.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   God just happened to play a role in that.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.240]   So many Christians fall away from their faith for that very reason.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.520]   As long as friendships are around and bills are paid and things are going well, but as
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.800]   soon as we get squeezed, it reveals that it is not God that we pursue.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:07.080]   And once God doesn't do it for them anymore, there's no reason to follow him.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.220]   And that's why many people begin to walk away from God.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.860]   But they were testing God for another reason.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.100]   They were testing God to see how far God's going to let them get away with this.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.520]   They were testing him.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.140]   Grumble after grumble, testing after testing, patience after patience, until it says in
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:31.020]   Hebrews 3 that their hearts got hardened and God was provoked.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.320]   This provoking isn't just God decided to become angry.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.340]   Something would be where, you know, or something happens and you just like, your anger just
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.340]   comes out.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.100]   Whether somebody cuts you off on the road, you know, maybe your younger brother just
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.940]   knows your button and he just pokes at it and you just get provoked.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.260]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.420]   Those of you who've been married for a long time, your wife and your husband, they know
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.780]   your weaknesses and when they're in their anger, they'll poke at it, right?
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.620]   And it's not a gradual climb.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.040]   It's just like, "What?"
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   That's the word.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.920]   God was provoked because he kept on waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.640]   After everything that he has done for the nation of Israel, they would not turn.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.940]   And as a result, in Hebrews 3, 11, it says, "I swore in my wrath they shall not enter
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.060]   my rest."
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   When God swears that he's going to do something, it is done.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.060]   This is not a warning.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:32.020]   God's not saying, "I swear in my anger that they will not enter my rest."
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.860]   He's like, "Okay, okay, okay, now, now, now, now, don't get that angry.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.280]   Give us one more chance."
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.340]   Just as God is reliable when he says he will save us, when he says judgment is coming,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.340]   it is done.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.340]   It is complete.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:51.340]   So, in other words, they took his patience to the far end until the point where he was
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.260]   provoked and he says, "That's it.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.580]   You will not enter my rest."
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.740]   You know what's interesting is Psalm chapter 81, 11 through 12, it describes God's anger
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.540]   toward Israel and what he does to them.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:08.220]   And he says this, "But my people did not listen to my voice and Israel did not obey me, so
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.620]   I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart to walk in their own devices."
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.900]   That doesn't sound too bad.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:22.620]   God was so angry and he said, "Just do whatever you want."
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.580]   That sounds like a lot of freedom.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.860]   That sounds like exactly what a rebellious person would want to hear.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.780]   Because a rebellious person is wrestling with God to do whatever he wants and then
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.000]   God's the one pounding and saying, "Hey, stop."
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.040]   But the judgment he describes is in the stubbornness of their heart.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.740]   He says, "Then go at it."
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.060]   That was his judgment.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.220]   Understand this.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:57.540]   All God has to do to judge mankind is to disappear.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.700]   Stop sending prophets.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.220]   Stop planting churches.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.860]   Stop having accountability.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.980]   Stop sending messengers.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.260]   Stop preaching.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.540]   Stop opening up the Bible.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.460]   All he has to do is just draw back and then let sin run its course.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.540]   That's why in Romans chapter 1 it says, "Wrath of God is being revealed in this generation."
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.420]   How is it being revealed?
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.980]   How is the wrath of God being revealed in our generation?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.260]   Romans chapter 1, 22 to 28, "Professing to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.420]   glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and the birds
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.860]   of the four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.740]   Therefore, God gave them over in their loss."
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.780]   That was the wrath of God.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.380]   Giving them over in their hearts of impurity so that their bodies would be designated among
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.340]   them for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.580]   rather than the creator who is blessed forever.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.580]   Amen?
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.580]   For this reason, what?
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.300]   God gave them over to their degrading passions over and over again.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:05.060]   His wrath is giving them over to their rebellion.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.820]   Go do it.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.980]   "For their woman exchanged the natural functions for that which was unnatural.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.020]   In the same way, also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.780]   their desire toward another.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.940]   Men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.980]   of their errors.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.460]   And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.900]   mind to do those things which are not proper."
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   God's wrath, according to Romans, is being revealed by just letting them go.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.420]   If that's what you want, do it.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.820]   Now let me describe why this is the judgment of God.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:55.940]   If you have a child at home, 10, 13, 14, 15, however old they are, if you have a child
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:04.820]   at home and you're fighting over the internet, you know, you're trying to put parental control,
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.740]   you're doing this, you're doing all for the purpose of protecting them, what would happen
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.180]   to a child if you didn't put limitations on them?
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.460]   You put a 10-year-old or 5-year-old in front of the computer and said, "I'm tired of this,"
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.620]   and you just wash your hands, go at it.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.540]   "I'm tired of fighting with you."
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   What will happen to that child?
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.380]   Is he going to Google, "How to clean my room?"
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.380]   Is that what's going to happen?
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.740]   Is he going to Google and find search, "Oh, I got the freedom to do whatever I want,"
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.700]   and then he's going to type in, "How to honor my father and mother."
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.780]   Is that what's going to happen?
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.900]   No.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.580]   The reason why the parents come in and put restriction is for their own good.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.620]   Reason why they get discipline is for their own good.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.060]   It's because the parents love them and it's trying to protect them.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:02.140]   We often think about, well, you know, when Israel committed sin, God came down and he
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   hammered them.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.880]   And we say, "Oh, that's the judgment of God."
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.740]   We look at the book of Revelation and say, "Oh, the wrath of God," because that's what
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.880]   the wrath of God, in our mind, we think that's what the wrath of God looks like.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.780]   But why go through all of this trauma?
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:23.420]   Because all he had to do is to one time smash and be over with.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.660]   Couldn't God have just said, "Israelites," and just...
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:32.220]   You got a bunch of ants coming into your house and you don't want them there?
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.620]   Finish.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.620]   That's my version of the flood.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.220]   That's all it took.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.380]   I don't think about it.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.800]   And I don't worry about their souls.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.560]   It was annoying me and I got rid of it.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.100]   That's all God needed to do.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:58.320]   But what is this trauma of dividing them and causing them to repent?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.640]   And you go to the book of Revelation, you have the seals, you have the bowls, you have
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:13.520]   the trumpets, and every time he brings these judgments, why go through all of this trauma?
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.920]   He's using that to bring sinners to repentance.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:25.200]   And the Bible clearly says he's disciplining because he's trying to bring them to repentance.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:32.680]   If God was truly, if he was truly done, there would be no drama of Revelation.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.640]   Revelation would take us straight to the right throne judgment and just done.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.400]   Finished.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.520]   It's his kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.960]   It's his kindness that brings discipline.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:55.000]   It's his kindness that warns us repeatedly because if you provoke him and if you continue
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.200]   at some point, he will swear you will not enter my rest.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   And that's what happened to the nation of Israel.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.800]   Israel pushed and pushed and pushed and they tested him and tested and tested him until
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.720]   he said that is enough.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   You know, we love to quote the passage in 2 Timothy chapter 2, 13, where we say, if
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.840]   we are faithless, he will be faithful because he cannot deny himself.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.720]   We love that passage.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.660]   We love that passage because it gives freedom for our faithlessness.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.660]   We screw up, we're sinners.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.000]   Well, all of it is true.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.160]   But we kind of use that as a get out of jail cart.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.040]   If we're faithless, he's faithful.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.400]   But here's a problem.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.560]   Right before that passage in verse 12, it says, if you deny him, he will deny you.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.400]   What do you do with that?
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.440]   I don't hear that being quoted too much.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.400]   You go to people's homes, it's like, if we are faithless, he is faithful because he cannot
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   deny himself.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   I love that.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   But if you deny him, he will deny you.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.000]   What do you do with that?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.360]   The perfect example of that is the nation of Israel.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.420]   If you deny him, he will deny you.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.920]   If you are faithless, he will remain faithful.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   You know what happened?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.600]   You know why they wandered in the desert for 40 years?
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.000]   Because he was waiting for them to die off.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.140]   Judgment was upon the nation of Israel.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.120]   Those people who were grumbling and complaining and they did not heed the warnings from God,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.400]   he waited 40 years for that generation to die off and a new generation to be risen.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.880]   So he was faithful to his promise to the nation of Israel.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.200]   He was faithful to the promise to the nation of Israel.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:46.440]   But those who denied him did not enter into the promised land.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.480]   That's how that verse is actualized in Scripture.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Those who deny him, he will deny them.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.360]   Those who are, although they were faithless, God remains faithful to himself, to the promises
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.240]   that he made.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.760]   It says their hearts went astray and they did not know him.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   They did not know his way.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.200]   He's not saying they didn't know about him.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.260]   They said, "Oh, we didn't know you didn't want us to grumble.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.820]   We didn't know that we should have been asking for food.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.880]   We didn't know we shouldn't have been worshiping the golden calf."
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.680]   It wasn't because they didn't have knowledge.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   That's not what he's talking about.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.080]   He's talking about they don't know God.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.040]   They didn't have a personal relationship with God.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.220]   Their affection was not toward God.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.120]   So as soon as they got squeezed, it revealed what was in their heart.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:41.160]   In John chapter 17, verse 3, it says, "This is the eternal life that they may know you,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.960]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960]   He said that's eternal life.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.900]   He said this is eternal life that they may know you.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.480]   And that's why in Matthew 7, verses 22 to 23, Jesus says, "Many will say to me on that
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.000]   day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name cast out demons
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.360]   and in your name perform many miracles?'
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.160]   And then I will declare to them, 'I never," what?
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.600]   "Knew you, apart from a you who practiced lawlessness."
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.760]   He says salvation is knowing him.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.520]   So in their hardened hearts, what happened was during those 40 years of trial, every
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:26.200]   time they got squeezed, it revealed that they knew nothing of their God.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:32.160]   They were more concerned about their safety, about their stomach, about their thirst, about
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:39.560]   comfort, about the land, and they did not know God.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.720]   You know, it's interesting, the way he describes his judgment is that he says he was provoked,
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.920]   he was angry that they would not enter their rest.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.720]   And that's what happened to the nation of Israel.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.360]   At least that generation dies off, new generation rises, and God allows them to get in.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.240]   The Bible describes our salvation as finding rest, rest in Christ.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.200]   That's why Jesus, when he invites people to come, he says, "Come to me, all who are weary
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.720]   and heavy laden, and I will give you that rest."
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.160]   I'm not going to go too deep into this theology because we're going to get deeper into it
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.600]   when we get into chapter 4.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.040]   But the Bible describes salvation as finding rest.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.380]   So you know what that means?
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:27.260]   Those who do not know Christ is in a perpetual state of restlessness.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.300]   And that's how Solomon described his life.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.340]   Here's a man who's not only a billionaire, you know, people fantasize about if I was
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.780]   a billionaire I could do whatever I want.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.500]   You can't.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.740]   You can't do whatever you want because there's laws.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.420]   Even if you have all the money in the world, you have to do it, you have to abide by the
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.780]   law.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:53.140]   And even if you had all the money, and even if you had the law, you don't have the wisdom.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.980]   You can go and blow your money, invest in the wrong place, and become poor the next
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.980]   day.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.620]   Well, Solomon had all three.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.620]   He had all the money in the world, he had all the power, he was the king, and he was
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.580]   the smartest man alive.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.540]   And he took all the resources.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:14.020]   So if anybody can experience the pleasures of this world, without limitation it would
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.940]   have been Solomon.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:22.380]   So his whole life was dedicated in experimenting.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.300]   Where is he going to find life?
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.820]   And you know the end result.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.620]   He had women, he had money, he had pleasure, he had everything that he could possibly,
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.700]   intellectually, socially, everything that he looked at, he wanted, he could have had
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.940]   instantaneously.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.860]   And at the end of it, what does he say?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   Vanity, vanity.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860]   Empty, empty.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.260]   All is empty.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.740]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.460]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.860]   How often do we fool ourselves to think that only if we had more money, only if we had
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.180]   more freedom, only if we were younger, only if this, only that.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.980]   Well Solomon had all of it.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.380]   It's empty.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.100]   You know what another word for empty is?
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.460]   Restless.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   He was restless.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.300]   He was trying to find rest.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   Why do we do what we do?
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   Because we want to find rest.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.900]   We want to find joy.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:14.900]   At the end of his life, all he found was emptiness.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.660]   Psalm 434 verse 8, it says, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.420]   How blessed is the man who takes refuge in him."
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.420]   What is refuge?
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.460]   What a place of rest.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.580]   Blessed is the man who knows true rest in him.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:36.060]   In Habakkuk verse 3, 17 to 18, it says, "Though the fig trees should not blossom, and there
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:42.020]   be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olive should fail, and the fields produce
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.580]   no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold, and there be no cattle in the
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:52.940]   stalls, yet I will exalt in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:58.340]   This is foolishness to somebody who does not know Christ.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.940]   Why would you exalt, why would you give him glory when he didn't give you bounty?
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:08.140]   When you have no food, you have no fruit, you have no harvest, and all of this is cut
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.180]   off, you have no cattle.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.400]   You have to understand, this is not a farmer who just casually has these things.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.420]   When he says he has none of that, this is a man who doesn't have anything.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.780]   And he says, "Yet I will exalt in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:33.180]   Unless you have tasted the goodness of God, this passage will never make any sense.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   If you are pursuing Christ, hoping that Christ is somehow going to lead you to the green
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.700]   pastures, and you're more committed to these green pastures, and that Jesus is only an
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.700]   avenue to get to the green pastures, the same temptation will overcome us.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:53.620]   Every time we're a little bit squeezed, we turn to tables.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.080]   Is God worthy to be praised?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.820]   So we praise him when we have good news.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.260]   We praise him when our bills are paid.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.700]   We praise him when our relationships are going well.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.300]   We praise him when our children are healthy.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.740]   But as soon as we are squeezed, we begin to grumble.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.820]   Is he worthy?
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.420]   Is he worthy?
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:22.500]   The Bible describes non-Christians whose eyes have been blinded because they do not see
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.300]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.620]   They don't see the joy in Christ.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.220]   They don't see the glory in Christ.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.820]   And that's why they pursue the world.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.820]   So a Christian is somebody whose eyes have become open, and we found life and rest in
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.780]   Christ.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:45.180]   And that's why Paul says in Philippians 4, 12-13, "I know how to get along with humble
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.900]   means and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.420]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being content and going hungry,
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.940]   both of having the abundance and suffering need.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.420]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:05.620]   Is Paul saying that he's learned, when he doesn't have money, how to stretch that dollar?
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.380]   Is Paul saying that when he has abundance, he knows how to save and put in the right
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.340]   investment and make sure that this never happens again?
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.580]   Obviously, that's not what he's saying.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.500]   He's sitting in prison, chained to a Roman guard, uncomfortable as you can possibly be,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.700]   possibly facing death, and he's trying to encourage the Christians outside and said,
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.140]   "Don't worry about me.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.860]   I've learned the secret of being content."
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.640]   This is a man who knew Jesus.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.660]   And that's why he says, "He desired to suffer to know Christ."
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:46.660]   If it means I can have more Christ, if I can have more of him, even if I die, if you ask
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:56.540]   me what I want, I'm ready to go because what I've tasted in Christ is so much better than
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.580]   everything that I've experienced before.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.300]   That's basically what it says in chapter three.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.020]   Everything that I knew before I met Christ became rubbish in light of the surpassing
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.340]   knowledge of knowing my Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:15.340]   Only a man who has tasted the goodness of God can say what he says.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.140]   And when he is squeezed, what comes out?
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.220]   Praise.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.900]   It's so subtle.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.820]   This difference between faith and unbelief, it is so subtle because it is not the distinction
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:39.980]   between church and non-church, small group or not small group, discipleship and non-discipleship.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.860]   Sometimes we can look at the external things and think that that is the evidence of Christianity.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.340]   It is not.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.180]   And you know it is not.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.100]   Those are the fruits of it, but it's not the cause of it.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.660]   The cause is always Christ, always Christ.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:02.660]   And that is the danger that you and I live in today where we are because we are busy.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.660]   We are active.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.420]   We are in the church.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.460]   We have membership.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:13.180]   And yet when we get squeezed, every time we get squeezed, it shows where we are.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.980]   Let me conclude with this because I read this testimony from Desiring God.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.460]   So if you wanted to go, this is only a portion of his testimony and I thought it was relevant
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.460]   to today.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.260]   It was written by a man named Greg Morse.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.980]   And this is a testimony of a man who was in the church serving and realized that he did
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.340]   not know Christ.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.900]   I thought I was a Christian for years.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.460]   I swore I had a relationship with God.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.220]   I believed I could die at any moment and be welcomed into heaven.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.420]   I wasn't.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.700]   I didn't.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.540]   And I wouldn't.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.100]   I did not have a category for someone thinking that they were a follower of Christ and not
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.880]   actually being one.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.760]   I assumed that if I had any desire to be a Christian, God should welcome me with shouts
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.920]   of joy.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.320]   I had never read that there would be people on Judgment Day who would emphatically greet
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.600]   Jesus calling him Lord, Lord and yet be rejected by him.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.260]   No one ever told me that people could do a lot of mighty works for God and yet still
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.480]   be lost.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.120]   I convinced myself that I was safe from the wrath of God.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.440]   No one told me that lukewarm Christians get spit out of God's mouth.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.580]   No one informed me that if God was not first in my heart, I was either in urgent need of
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.340]   repentance or was lost.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.240]   In the words of Francis Chan, I was lukewarm and loving it.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.560]   I did not have a category for something, someone thinking that they were a follower of Christ
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.640]   and not actually being one.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.800]   I didn't curse much.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.040]   I wasn't sleeping around.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.780]   I went to church most Sundays.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.480]   I must be a Christian.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.240]   I said that Jesus died for my sins.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.280]   I sang the lyrics on the screens.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.760]   I prayed before meals.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.600]   I gave God props for my athletic achievements.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.240]   I must be a Christian.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.400]   Sure, God wasn't my all in all.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.880]   Sure, I never read his word.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.600]   Sure, I didn't pray very much.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.440]   Sure, I secretly loved sin.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.520]   Sure, holiness seemed dreadfully boring.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.720]   Sure, I rarely owned him in public or spent time with him in private, but he understood.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.320]   I was only human after all.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.360]   No one is perfect.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.520]   If God had not intervened, I would have awoken from my delusion to a lake of fire.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.400]   I imagined I feasted at the table of grace, drank from the chalice of eternal life, but
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.520]   I was eating garbage and drinking sewer water.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.580]   I was dreaming like those described in Isaiah 29.8.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.880]   It will be as when a hungry man dreams and behold, he is eating, but when he awakens,
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.040]   his hunger is not satisfied.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.680]   Or as when a thirsty man dreams and behold, he is drinking, but when he awakens, behold,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.600]   he is faint and his thirst is not quenched.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.920]   What a sober reminder for all of us.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   Is our faith real?
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.080]   The question is not did you go to church, did you grow up in the church, how many Bible
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.920]   verses did you memorize, are you active, are you tithing?
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.800]   That is not the question.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.840]   The question is do you know this Jesus?
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   Are you living in restlessness, jumping from relationship to relationship, from experience
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.920]   to experience, from one stage of life to the next stage of life, because you do not know
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.880]   Jesus?
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.080]   Have you tasted the goodness of God?
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.280]   Did he actually open your eyes and did you actually see the glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.920]   Christ that caused you to want him more than this world?
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.040]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.200]   The danger that you and I are in, grown up in the church, spending years committed, actively
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:50.400]   serving maybe even leading in the church, we may automatically assume when Christ comes,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.680]   Lord, Lord, and he may turn the tables on us and say, I never knew you.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.280]   I pray that that is not the case with us.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.680]   There's a reason why the Bible keeps warning over and over and over.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.380]   This is not the end of his warning.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.600]   This warning is going to keep coming up.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.240]   He's going to tell us about the goodness of God and the glory of Christ and how he is
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:17.040]   above all else and how he's worthy to be exalted, and then he will always couple that with how
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:24.440]   can you escape if you ignore such a great salvation, if you just kick the can down the
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   road and thinking tomorrow.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.280]   If today if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:38.100]   If God is calling you to repentance, repent today, not tonight, not at your home, today.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:43.860]   If you've drifted away from God, you know all the right things to say about Christianity.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   You've got all the things checked mark, but there is no affection for Christ and it taints
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.660]   everything that you do.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.260]   Everything's a drudgery.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.480]   Everything is work.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.880]   Everything is irritating because you have not rested in Christ.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.360]   Is Christ truly your all?
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.760]   Do you know this Christ?
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.880]   Have you met this Christ?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.620]   Has your eyes truly been opened?
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.380]   Salvation is knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.480]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.260]   Put away all the external distractions.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.280]   If none of your friends came to this church, would you still come to church?
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.680]   If the songs didn't meet your preference, would you still come to church?
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.580]   Would you still serve the church if you were the only Christian in Irvine?
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.160]   Would you still serve the church if it meant you would lose your job?
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:40.800]   Would you still follow Christ if you would lose your bank account as a result?
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.520]   Is Christ your treasure?
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.960]   Is he your goal?
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.600]   Is he your hope?
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.120]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.200]   If you hear his voice, do not delay.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.880]   It is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.160]   Anything else, we're fooling ourselves.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.200]   Anything less than that, we're fooling ourselves.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:16.420]   God is not demanding that hardcore, disciplined, strong-willed people come to Christ.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:21.040]   God is calling people who are weak-willed, who are weak and easily distracted, and to
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.560]   surrender our lives to Christ and see that he is worth more than anything else that we
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.800]   are tempted in, anything else that we've been entangled with, that is straining the joy
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.160]   and the life that he has given us.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.300]   And until we repent, that we really truly come to Christ, you will never know.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:40.720]   You will always watch from a distance and hear other people's testimony and think to
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.180]   yourself, "Maybe one day, I hope I can experience that."
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.720]   But it never comes, because you're always delaying.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:54.300]   Tomorrow, when it's easier, when circumstances change.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.340]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:02.140]   If you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:14.000]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.880]   As our worship team leads us, I pray that his word and the example of the Israelites
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.040]   would sober us.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:32.520]   Again, our natural response to something like this could easily be, "Well, thank God I'm
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.080]   not like that.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.620]   I wish that person was here.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:43.760]   I wish my mom, my dad, my brother, they really needed to listen to this."
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.960]   If we're not careful, we can easily check off the box and look at the things that we're
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.320]   doing in life without really examining where your heart is.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.840]   Do you really love Jesus?
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.840]   Have you seen him?
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:04.080]   When's the last time you actually conversed with him?
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   When you get squeezed, where do you turn to?
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.520]   Do you look for counselors, your leaders?
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.840]   You turn on Netflix?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   You take a trip?
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.280]   Is Jesus really your refuge?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.960]   Why do you come to church?
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.800]   Because your friends are here?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.320]   Did you invest it too much?
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   Is it out of habit?
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.520]   Or did you come this morning wanting to hear from the Lord?
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:43.680]   Did you come this morning because you wanted to hear his voice?
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Come to the Lord.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.240]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.600]   He said he was going to give us rest.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.480]   Where are you looking for this rest?
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.400]   Come to Christ.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.600]   Confess your sins.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:07.160]   Ask the Lord to save us, restore us, revive us.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.880]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
