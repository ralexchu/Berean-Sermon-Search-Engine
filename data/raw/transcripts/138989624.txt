[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   To Romans chapter one, as you guys know, we visited the Troy family, the BMC up north.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.100]   And I know we've all been praying for Emily and their family.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.440]   But this coming coming weeks are extremely crucial.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.280]   They're leaving for New York tomorrow and they're going to be out there and they're
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.600]   going to be going through some tests.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.000]   And then at the end of the week, they're going to find out exactly what procedure they're
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   going to take.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.600]   And most likely, the parents told us that she's going to end up having surgery.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.000]   And if everything goes well, they're going to give her time to recuperate.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.600]   And they're hoping to be back at at their home up north in about three weeks.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.480]   But from the very beginning, when we heard about this news, they said that the best case
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.760]   scenario is for her to have brain surgery.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.040]   So there's a two year old child where they're going into her brain and taking out two tumors.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   And so I know we've all been praying, but especially for the next three weeks, it's
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.880]   going to be very crucial.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.600]   And so we asked that you would really be on your knees and be prayer for Emily and for
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   their family.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.720]   And I know that the initial shock of the news, we've kind of gotten accustomed to it and
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.120]   we're still praying for them.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.520]   But like I said, the next three weeks are crucial.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.360]   And so that again, that the doctors who are performing surgery, that they'll go in and
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.720]   they'll be able to be as precise as possible because it is brain surgery.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.400]   They did caution that there's a possibility of after effects.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.480]   And you know, I won't get into the details, but there's a lot of concern for that.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.960]   So if you guys can please continue to be in prayer and they're going to be out in New
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.400]   York on their own.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.880]   They have some people coming in and out, but for the most part, they're going to be alone.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.680]   They're not going to have the support system that they had up north.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.760]   So please, please continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.160]   And as we get updates, we'll let you know.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.600]   So you guys can be in prayer.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   Okay.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.080]   Now, if you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter one, we'll be reading from verse eight
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.580]   through 13.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.320]   Our primary focus this morning is going to be from 11 through 15, but I'll be reading
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.640]   from eight through 15.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.400]   in all the world.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.320]   For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son, that without
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.480]   ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.020]   at last succeed in coming to you.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.480]   For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   That is that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.880]   I want you to know brothers that I have often intended to come to you, but thus far have
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.820]   been prevented in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.080]   of the Gentiles.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.440]   I am under obligation both to the Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.640]   foolish, so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.440]   Let's pray.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.960]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your anointing, your blessing.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.440]   We pray, Father God, that your word would go forth with the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.160]   It would convict us, encourage us, strengthen us, and remind us, Lord God, who we are in
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.800]   you and our calling, Lord God, that we may live lives truly worthy of the glory of Jesus
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   Christ.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Amen.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.040]   As we've been studying through the book of Romans, you know, last few times we were talking
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.120]   about how chapter 1 is basically, half of chapter 1 is an introduction of Apostle Paul.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   He's going to get into the meat of what he wants to say to this church and start from
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.800]   verse 18.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.280]   And so the gospel message, we'll be there in about two weeks, but the gospel message
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.240]   in verse 18 begins with "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.800]   Before he begins to introduce why there is a need for Jesus, why he died, what his death
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.380]   means, there has to be a conviction for the need for the gospel.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.440]   If there isn't a deep brokenness over our sins, the gospel is just going to be message.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.600]   It's just going to be news, but it's not good news.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.360]   So we're going to dive into that when we get to verse 18, but prior to that, Paul begins
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.820]   to introduce himself because he hasn't been to this church.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.060]   They know of him, and he knows of them, but they don't know each other intimately.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.560]   So we looked at in the beginning, Paul begins the letter by introduction of himself, who
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   he is.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.720]   He's a bond servant of Jesus Christ, called as an apostle for the purpose of the gospel.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.320]   The second week we talked about his message, how this message was not something that he
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.600]   received by himself.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.040]   It was given to all the prophets of the Old Testament, and now we see in every part of
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.680]   Israel's history the preparation for the coming of Christ, and we looked at that when we talked
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.520]   about the gospel message.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.940]   A couple weeks ago we talked about his ministry.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.820]   He talked about himself, he talked about the gospel, he talked about his ministry, and
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.760]   we talked about how personal his ministry was.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.740]   That it wasn't just his job, it was his calling.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.220]   That he, this is my God, this is, you are my, in my heart, my prayer.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.600]   And so how personal this is.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.340]   Well today we're going to be talking about Paul's goal in ministry.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.700]   So he's laying all this out before he actually even jumps into the message.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   What is his goal?
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.040]   Well, he explains that to us again, if you were to go back with us in verse 11, he explains
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.260]   why he wants to come to them.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.060]   And again, why he's even writing this letter.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.820]   It says, "For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.820]   you."
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.540]   So his whole reason why he wants to come to Rome is so that they may be strengthened.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.980]   But what he says initially, he says, "I want to impart some spiritual gifts to you, to
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.060]   strengthen you."
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.820]   So there's some debate as to what does he mean when Paul says he's coming to strengthen
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.260]   you, to impart some spiritual gifts.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.100]   Now if you are, if you have a charismatic background, or maybe you've been taught differently,
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.700]   you may say, "Well, Paul's talking about spiritual gifts as in he's laying hands, and they're
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.980]   going to speak in tongues, and prophecy, and gift of healing."
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.340]   Not to say that we can't say that, but again, whenever we look at scripture, you have to
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.380]   make sure that scripture is reinterpreting scripture.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.300]   Paul's not going to contradict himself.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.500]   And we have to understand when Paul uses certain languages, that he's consistent with the other
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   letters.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.140]   He's consistent with what other people say, right?
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.040]   What other parts of the Bible say.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.820]   So what we want to look at, when Paul says that he's imparting spiritual gifts, and for
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.940]   the purpose of strengthening them, what do other passages and other parts of the Bible
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.500]   say about that?
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.380]   Turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians chapter 4, 11 through 14.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.260]   Now, I don't want to spend too much time on this because that's not the main point, but
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.620]   I do want to touch upon it because it is an issue that is talked about and debated.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.960]   Ephesians 4, 11 through 14.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.020]   It describes the beginning of the church.
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.580]   It describes how church is strengthened and built up and united.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.320]   And this is what it says, Ephesians 4, 11 through 14.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.780]   With his own words, Paul writes this, "And he, Jesus, gave the apostles," and again,
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.380]   this is not just a generic use of the term apostle.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.540]   He's talking about specifically the few apostles that were anointed, right?
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.940]   Specifically called, "the prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip the saints
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.540]   for the work of ministry."
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.500]   So if you notice, every one of these titles, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.140]   and teachers, that every single one of them, there's a unifying calling for each one of
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.420]   them.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.320]   And I think it's pretty obvious that the primary work of each of these offices is to preach
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.420]   the Word of God.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.740]   It's to teach and to preach the Word of God.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.940]   That's the apostles are receiving revelation from Christ, and so they're teaching and preaching
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.140]   the Gospel.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.940]   The prophets are proclaiming this, what they have heard, and then evangelists are to go
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.260]   outside and to share the Gospel.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.340]   Pastors are to teach and to equip and shepherd within the church.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:06.060]   And then the teachers, obviously, is to, it's pretty obvious, even in the name itself.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:13.160]   That God, Christ, gave the church, these people, to equip the saints for the work of ministry,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.420]   to strengthen them for the building up of the body of Christ until we all attain the
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.580]   unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.740]   So the primary way that God has given the church to strengthen the church is by the
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.060]   teaching of the Word of God.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.900]   To mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.980]   no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried away by every wind of
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.260]   doctrine by humankind by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.220]   So what does he mean?
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.520]   You may look at that pastor and say, "Well, he's imparting spiritual gifts, we don't have
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.620]   apostles to come, and if he's laying hands on people so that they can prophesy and they
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.020]   can heal, then we're in trouble.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.540]   Because we don't have apostles.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.460]   And we don't have people coming around and giving these spiritual gifts."
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.420]   But I don't think that that's what Paul is talking about predominantly.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.540]   Not that Paul as an apostle couldn't do that, but if you look at the other text in the Bible,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.420]   it is clear that what Paul and what Christ says predominantly, what he has given the
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.700]   church to equip and to strengthen, to unify the church, is the Word of God.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   Even Christ himself said, "The whole reason why you perform miracles is so that they would
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.300]   identify who he is and hear his message and believe him and follow him."
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.300]   Think about all those people who've seen his miracles and yet when he was going to the
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.660]   cross they rejected him.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.380]   Remember what Peter says?
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.300]   He's talking about the Trinity, he's seen his glory, but he says, "We have something
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.340]   more sure, which is the Word of God."
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:54.660]   See, Paul, his intention, his goal of ministry is by coming to Rome and to continue to teach,
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.740]   continue to clarify the Gospel, which is exactly what he's going to be doing in the Book of
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.220]   Romans, in order that they may be strengthened.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.660]   In Titus 1.5, you see the same thing.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.380]   Paul writes to Titus and he tells him, "The whole reason why I left you in the island
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.580]   of Crete is so that you may continue and finish the work that we started and establish elders
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.580]   in the church."
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.300]   He didn't just go there and preach the Gospel and then move on and say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.860]   These people made decisions, so I'm going to move on."
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.620]   His whole goal was to establish and plant the church, and then he says, "You need to
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.860]   stick around.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.520]   These people were converted, so you can disciple them, and that those disciples will eventually
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.340]   become elders, and when you have elders in the church, then you can move on, so that
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.280]   they can continue to equip and to strengthen the church."
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.500]   So you can see that even in Paul, when he goes to each of these places, that his goal
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.540]   is not simply to say, "Thus saith the Lord," and he hears the Gospel and then move on.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.620]   His goal was disciple-making.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.380]   That's his intention from the beginning, when he sent out his disciples.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.460]   He didn't say, "Go and tell them what the Gospel is."
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.020]   He says, "No, go and make disciples."
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.820]   We see that in Acts chapter 16, 5.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.140]   Some of you guys who are with us in the study of the book of Acts, something very important
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.980]   happens in Acts chapter 15.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.220]   Acts chapter 15, there is the first council of the church, where all the apostles and
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.580]   the disciples get together, and there's a discussion that takes place that, "Did the
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.420]   Gospel get to the Gentiles?
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.260]   Can they also be followers of Christ?"
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.820]   And they have this huge discussion that the Gentiles do not need to be circumcised.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.780]   That they don't need to become a Jew in order to become a Christian.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.100]   So this is huge news.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.820]   For thousands of years, they thought that the Kingdom of God was about Israel.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.540]   But all of a sudden, the Kingdom of God is open to the Gentiles.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:51.180]   So Apostle Paul and his companions take this message, and his whole second missionary journey
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.580]   begins because he's trying to convey this message to these villages.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.380]   So he goes to the villages and he's sharing with them the vastness of his kingdom and
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.380]   his love.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.820]   How the Kingdom of God has been open to the Gentiles, you don't need to be circumcised.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.180]   And then this is how it's described.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:13.700]   Acts chapter 16, 5, his second ministry journey of clarifying the Gospel, he says this, "So
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:21.020]   the churches were strengthened in faith, and they increased in numbers daily."
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.180]   They were increased in faith.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.580]   How were they increased in faith?
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.620]   Not because he was performing miracles, but because he was clarifying the Gospel.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.860]   He was making it clear to them.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.060]   So as they heard the Word of God, they were being strengthened and being equipped.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.780]   And as a result of them being equipped, what happened?
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.780]   The church increased.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.040]   Why, you know, I'm going to take a few minutes to stop and talk about this for a few minutes,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.500]   because this is so important.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.220]   Especially in today's generation.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.260]   You know, when I was in seminary, there was this movement, this church marketing movement
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.260]   that came in.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.780]   And it's now, after what, about, what has it been, four or five years?
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:10.140]   It's now that this movement has come in, it's kind of embedded itself in the church, it's
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.540]   almost kind of like a given.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.900]   If you want the church to be successful, if you want it to grow, if you want to attract
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.820]   a lot of people, you have to dummy it down.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.180]   You know, you can't just straight up give them theology.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.340]   You can't just straight up exposit the Bible, because no one's interested in that.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.100]   We have churches now, and we've heard of churches, I've met people who would say, "You can't
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.540]   teach Bible study?
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.540]   People are not interested in that."
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   Right?
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.260]   "How come we don't have Bible study?
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.260]   Because no one's going to come."
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.300]   And the sad truth is, that's true.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.820]   You can call it Bible study, but you can't actually study the Bible.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   Right?
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:53.100]   So, I've, every once in a while, I'll have fellowship outside of my little bubble, and
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.260]   I'll try to fellowship with people from different denominations and different schools, and we
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260]   would have this conversation, talking about, "Oh, what does your church service look like?
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.580]   You know, what does your Bible study, what does your discipleship look like?"
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.580]   And sooner or later, we get to the conversation of, "How long is your sermon?"
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.580]   Right?
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.180]   "How long is your sermon?"
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.700]   And so, typically, I would say, "Well, I shoot for 40 minutes, and typically I fail.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.980]   If I shoot for 40 minutes, I usually go about 45 minutes.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.100]   Every once in a while, I go about 50 minutes."
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.100]   Right?
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:29.460]   And when I tell them, like, "50 minutes," people come.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.300]   And they're just dumbfounded.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.940]   Like, "People sit through that for 50 minutes?"
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.300]   I said, "What is your Bible study like?"
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.100]   "Well, we study the Bible.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.820]   We call it Bible study, so we're studying the Bible."
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.660]   I said, "People come to that?"
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.020]   Because that's been their experience.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.220]   Their experience has been, "Well, if we do this, you know, the people are just not interested,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   so let's get rid of it.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.580]   Let's do something, you know, we'll just kind of sprinkle a little bit of the Bible, and
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.980]   then spend the rest of the time rock climbing or something, and then that'll attract the
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   people."
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:06.020]   And the sad truth is, that's how churches, in a lot of circles, are growing.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.140]   But if you look at the early church, he said, "Why did it grow?"
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.140]   You know?
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.140]   "Why did it grow?"
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.060]   He says, "Because the churches were being strengthened in faith.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.820]   Because their faith was being strengthened," he says, "that they were increasing in number."
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.460]   We've always said, from the beginning of the church, and again, you know, I've gone through
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.860]   that the first part of my younger ministry, you know, I didn't know, like, what I was
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   supposed to do.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.100]   And seminary, to be honest, doesn't train you for ministry.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.860]   It trains you to know the Bible, right?
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.860]   How to interpret the Bible.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.260]   It doesn't teach how to do ministry, like, you know, how to do communion.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.740]   I didn't learn any of that.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.740]   We're just winging it, you know?
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.980]   So, you know, first part of ministry, oh, that's what you're supposed to do.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.380]   I just tried this, and I tried this, and tried that.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.380]   And I just got burnt out.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.700]   And to be honest, the church grew.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.340]   You know, the youth group grew, the college ministry grew, the young adult ministry grew,
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:04.140]   and it was growing, but I looked at the growth, and I was extremely dissatisfied.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.060]   I would stand up on a pulpit, on some Sundays, and I would just stand there, just looking
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.860]   at the crowd, thinking, "These people could care less what I'm about to say."
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.860]   You know?
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.420]   But I have to say it anyway, because I'm getting paid.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.420]   You know, I got to, this is my job, so I have to say it.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.900]   And that just completely burned me out.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.660]   And I remember during that period, after, I was thinking about it, I was like, "I don't
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.220]   know if I want to do this."
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.340]   I feel more like a social worker than a preacher of the Word, you know?
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.900]   Like, I got to song and dance to make sure everybody's happy, and everybody's getting
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.700]   along, and, you know, I got to do this, and I got to do that.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.540]   And I got burned out, almost left the ministry, and again, the only reason why I stayed in
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.660]   ministry, because Esther said, "Don't quit."
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.380]   You know, I'm not going to go too deep into that, but she said, "Don't quit."
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.380]   My mom told me, "Don't quit."
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.580]   And I said, "Okay, then I won't quit."
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.580]   You know?
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.540]   It's more complicated than that, but that's basically what happened.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.820]   So when we planted this church, we, I came in thinking, "You know what?
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.780]   I don't know if the church is going to grow."
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:07.860]   And it didn't, for the first six, seven years of the church.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.060]   But I'm not going to do that again, you know?
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.980]   Because even if it grows, it's not what I want.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.180]   I don't, that's not a genuine church.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.220]   I grew up in the church all my life.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.420]   I saw the superficieness of the church, and I'm not going to be a part of that.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.060]   I'd rather have a secular job than do that.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:29.780]   So our intention was, from the beginning and to this day, that whatever growth is going
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.540]   to happen, it's going to happen because people want to know Christ.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.540]   And that's it.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.940]   Our church is not very sophisticated.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.900]   Some of you guys may have already picked that up, you know what I mean?
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.380]   Because we're not good at hiding it.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.780]   There's a lot of stuff we're not good at.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.220]   Because I'm not good at it, right?
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.220]   But we said, "You know what?
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.220]   I'm not going to go around and plug up holes and make it look professional and have color
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.260]   everything and fantastic."
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.940]   But we're going to make sure that at the core of it, that what we do have is Christ, that
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.620]   the Word of God is taught.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.780]   Because I believe whatever growth happens, that it should happen with genuine followers
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.260]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260]   That if the church is going to grow, it's going to grow because people are hungry for
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.740]   God.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.780]   Not because they were lonely.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.100]   Not because they want VBS for their children.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.820]   In and of itself, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.980]   But the church should not grow because the Word of God is taught, but they're not interested,
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.340]   but let's do something else.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.580]   Then after a while, you're going to have a church packed with people in the name of Jesus,
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.300]   but nobody's interested in Jesus.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:46.500]   I'm absolutely convinced that if you are a genuine follower of Jesus Christ, nothing
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.740]   else will satisfy you but Christ.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.140]   I'm absolutely convinced.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.540]   I will take that to my grave.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.900]   Maybe you notice it or you don't notice it, but I'm absolutely convinced.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.220]   If you have been justified, and justification basically means you heard the Gospel of Jesus
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.740]   Christ and you've seen the light.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.660]   You've seen the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and you were attracted to Him.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.280]   That's why you're here.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.340]   That's why you're giving offerings.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.060]   That's why you're spending your free time serving the church.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:24.260]   Because you saw something in Christ that you couldn't find anywhere else but in Christ.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.580]   So if we continue to, if we build a church to give you anything else but Christ, we wouldn't
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.180]   be doing you any service.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.380]   I believe that life is in Christ and it's in Christ alone.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:43.300]   That's why when Paul says he's come to strengthen the church, you know, we may hear what Paul
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.900]   says, it's like, you know, again, Paul's talking to a church that he just said was a model
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.300]   church.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.620]   That their faith is being proclaimed all throughout the world.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.340]   So he's not talking about a church that's backsliding.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.200]   He's not talking about the Corinthians Church or the Laodicean Church or the Church of Ephesus.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.140]   He's talking about a great church.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.980]   And yet he says, "I want to come to you to impart some spiritual gifts that you may be
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.180]   strengthened further."
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.140]   Right?
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.660]   If you're not careful, you may listen to that and say, "You know, that sounds like
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.660]   my mom, you know.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.820]   I used to get a B+ and she said, 'How come you didn't get an A?'"
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.140]   You know, "I got 3.9 but she said, 'Why didn't you get 4.0?'"
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   You know?
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.140]   "I got 4.4, not 4.5?"
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.140]   You know?
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.380]   "I got into UCLA, not Harvard?"
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:39.180]   He says, Paul says in Philippians chapter 1, 9-11, another exemplary church.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.100]   You know, these churches in Macedonia, the Philippian Church and the Thessalonian Church,
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.000]   they were experiencing tremendous famine.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.060]   But because Jerusalem was experiencing this famine, they begged Paul, "Give us an opportunity
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.060]   to give."
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.220]   Even in their extreme famine.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.540]   So this was a model church and he's writing this letter.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.540]   And this is what, look what he says.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.020]   Philippians 1, 9-11, "And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more."
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.180]   You guys don't need me to teach you because God Himself is teaching you about love.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.820]   But we want you to do this more and more.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.420]   "With knowledge and all discernment so that you may approve what is excellent and so to
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.100]   be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.820]   comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.260]   Again, you hear that and it's like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.660]   You're talking to an A student and they're saying, "Get an A+."
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:35.180]   If you don't listen carefully of the meaning behind what Paul is saying, you're going to
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.180]   end up leaving.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.420]   Whenever there is a push to sanctification, legalism.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.540]   I don't feel delivered.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.380]   I don't feel free.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.880]   I feel more burdened today.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.100]   So let's get rid of that and just talk about justification.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.660]   How He loves us and how He accepts us so that we can be free every week.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.420]   So whenever this push towards sanctification happens, we say, "Burden."
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:04.700]   So again, some of you may have already kind of like, "That sounds like A+."
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.260]   Again to the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 4.1, "Finally then, brothers, we ask you and
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.820]   urge you in the Lord."
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.180]   I mean, He doesn't just say, "Hey, you're doing great.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.620]   Just do a little bit more."
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.740]   There's a sense of urgency to do more.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.900]   "Urge you in the Lord, Jesus, that as you receive from us how you ought to live and
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.260]   please God just as you are already doing to do this more and more."
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.060]   Does that sound good?
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   You feel challenged?
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.700]   Now let's do it.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.060]   There's some of you who are high achievers, right?
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.540]   And you work out every single day.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.860]   You never eat above 1,500 calories.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   You sleep.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.940]   You never watch more than a movie per year.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.540]   I mean, you read a book every two days.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.660]   I mean, you're just high-functioning people.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.660]   Let's do it!
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.660]   And it's like, "Yes!"
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.940]   And for the rest of us, "I haven't read a book in a couple years."
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.900]   I say, "Every morning I wake up at 7, you wake up at 9, you know.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:10.740]   You start out your workout routine, you make it about half a day, you know, and it just
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.740]   never seems to go."
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.820]   And then you read stuff like this, and He says, "No, you're doing great, but keep doing
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.060]   it more and more.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.540]   I urge you to do it.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.020]   What you're doing is not enough.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   To go further.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.020]   Let's do it!"
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.020]   And it's like, "Oh my gosh!"
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:28.340]   You know, this sounds like a Pharisee burden.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.020]   Isn't that what the Pharisees did?
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.020]   Didn't the Pharisees take the Law of God and they added all of these things, and you've
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   got to do more and more?
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.260]   You're obeying the Sabbath, and He said, "No, you've got to do more and more.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.060]   You're going to the temple giving sacrifices."
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.060]   It's like, "That's not enough.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.860]   You've got to do more and more."
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.100]   But why does Paul say this to the church?
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   Why is there this push to sanctification?
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.280]   Because he's not talking to Pharisees, he's not talking to people in the Law, he's talking
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:05.340]   about Christians in the church to push towards sanctification, to urge towards sanctification.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.900]   If that's not enough, let me give you a little bit more.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.100]   If you're burdened already, I'm going to burden you some more.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.100]   Okay?
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   2 Peter 1, 5-8.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.740]   Peter says, and it's not just Paul, so you can't just blame Paul.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.780]   Peter says, "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue,
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.500]   and with virtue knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.820]   steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, brotherly affection
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.820]   with love.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:37.580]   For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.940]   in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.820]   Do you feel free?
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.580]   Or do you feel burdened?
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.580]   Let's be honest.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.460]   If you've been a Christian for a while, push for sanctification is no longer something
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.900]   that you receive in joy.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.900]   Feels burdened.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.620]   Why is this church constantly pushing us to seek holiness?
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.360]   To evangelize?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   To pray?
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.860]   To have communion with God?
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.100]   And just kind of like, "That sounds Pharisaic."
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.020]   And yet, Paul says it.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.020]   Peter says it.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.940]   James says it.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.140]   Book of Hebrews says it.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.380]   And yes, even Galatians.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.380]   And yes, Book of Romans.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.940]   It's going to be presented in the Gospel.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.300]   It's going to get to chapter 12.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.660]   And he says, "Present your body as a living sacrifice."
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:45.420]   Fundamentally, so fundamentally, we misunderstand what sanctification is.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.500]   People think sanctification is a way for us to appease God.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.140]   That if we work and if we achieve a certain level, that we're going to get to a point
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.060]   where God's going to be pleased with us.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:02.540]   And so we see sanctification as a hoop that we need to jump through and a grade that we
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.460]   need to meet in order to get to the side and get the reward.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.100]   But the problem is, no matter how high we go, we never quite make it.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:17.980]   See, but that's where Christ came in.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   Sanctification is not an avenue to jump through a hoop to get the reward on the other side.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.660]   Sanctification itself is the reward.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.660]   Let me say that again.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.660]   Sanctification, spiritual growth, discipleship is the reward.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:43.100]   Paul says that "godliness with contentment in and of itself is great gain."
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:50.620]   Let me explain to you why Paul keeps doing this.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.820]   When you move to another country, if you, let's say as an example to China, because
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.180]   we do ministry out in China.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.860]   When you go to China and you move out there, one of the first things that you need to do
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:05.740]   is you lived in American culture, you ate certain food, you spoke a certain language.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.140]   In order for you to adjust to that new country, what's the first thing that you need to do?
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.140]   Change your language, right?
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.660]   You have to learn the language.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.140]   And then you have to learn the culture.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.300]   And then your diet is going to change, right?
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.620]   So if you take all the habits that you have living in the United States and then you go
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.940]   to China and say, "You know what?
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.780]   I'm an English speaker.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.620]   I'm only going to speak to people who speak English."
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.620]   Right?
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.620]   "Oh, I love hamburger.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.260]   I don't like Chinese food.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.740]   So I'm only going to eat hamburgers."
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.740]   Right?
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.220]   "Well, you know, I grew up in a Western freedom country and you're not going to let this communist
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.020]   country tell me what to do."
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   Right?
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.540]   Let me tell you something.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.700]   You're going to be miserable.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.340]   Not only are you going to be miserable.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.100]   You're going to make everybody around you miserable.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.540]   And they're going to be looking at you like, "What is wrong with that guy?
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.580]   Why did he move here?"
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   Right?
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:01.980]   Sanctification, the scripture describes, is moving from one kingdom to another.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.500]   In Colossians 1.13-14, he says, "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness, transferred
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:13.540]   us to the kingdom of his beloved son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.260]   So we were once bound in the kingdom of darkness, and now we have been delivered from that.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.940]   Now we are in the kingdom of his glorious son.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.180]   So when we transfer this kingdom, the culture that you were used to, the food that you used
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:34.240]   to eat, the kind of things that you were accustomed to in this kingdom, now is being transferred
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   over here.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.860]   So you didn't earn your citizenship.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:43.100]   Jesus Christ earned a citizenship and naturalized you as his adopted son.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.700]   But now that you are in his new kingdom, you are learning to function in his new kingdom.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.820]   Because the sooner you learn the language, the easier your life will be in the new kingdom.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.620]   The sooner you learn to eat Chinese food, you can eat anywhere you want.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:03.260]   The sooner you learn the culture, you can assimilate and be part of the people.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:08.020]   But as long as you hold on to that old kingdom, as long as you hold on to what you were used
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.260]   to back over there, your life becomes that much more difficult.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.100]   That's sanctification.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.380]   Sanctification is freeing us from what used to bind us in our old kingdom.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.500]   So when we see sanctification as a hoop that we need to get through to get the rewards,
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.260]   and not realizing that the more we become like Christ, the more free we are to live.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.780]   Do you understand?
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.180]   The more we live, the more we are closer to Christ.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.020]   The more we understand his heart, the more we speak his language, the more we are accustomed
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.420]   to everything of Christ allows us to function in this new kingdom with joy.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.900]   Jesus Christ said, "If you drink of the water that is over here, you're going to be thirsty
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.100]   again and you're going to have to keep going there.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.620]   But if you drink of the water that I give you, you will never thirst.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.380]   If you keep going back and eating of the bread that the world offers to you, you're going
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.700]   to be hungry again.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.380]   But if you eat the bread that I give you, you will never go hungry again."
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:17.300]   So the process of sanctification is moving us from one citizenship to another citizenship
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.740]   for what purpose?
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   To live.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.140]   And that's why Jesus says in John 10, 10, "I have come to give life and give this life
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.140]   abundantly."
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.340]   The very things that used to bind you, now God is challenging us, "Leave that aside and
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:36.860]   come into my kingdom so that you may experience this joy and have this joy abundantly."
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:44.100]   See, when we don't understand that, we think of sanctification as a task that we need to
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   get over.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:51.180]   And so whenever something becomes a task, it becomes burdensome.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.260]   Not realizing righteousness in itself is the reward.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:01.180]   If you're a Christian, if you are a true Christian, you will never experience more joy than when
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.900]   you are at the center of the will of God.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.140]   When you're living according to His will.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.540]   That's why it says in Psalm chapter 1, "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.940]   of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, sit in the seat of mockers, but his delight
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.700]   is in the law of the Lord and on this law he meditates day and night."
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.940]   He's like a tree planted by the living water.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.340]   His leaf will never wither.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.220]   It'll live.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.180]   And whatever he does will prosper.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.180]   Why?
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.460]   Because he's planted by the living water.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.060]   Because he's meditating on the word of God.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.020]   Because he's being sanctified.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.020]   See, what Paul is doing here, he's not burdening them.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.020]   He said, "Do this.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.300]   You're doing a great job, but do this more and more."
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.180]   What he's telling them to do is live.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.900]   You're getting good with the language.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.820]   Now keep going.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.420]   You're getting accustomed to the food.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.420]   Don't stop there.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.420]   Keep going.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:59.100]   The more accustomed you become to this new culture, the more you will be able to live
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.460]   in freedom.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:07.940]   So righteousness and holiness is our path to freedom, not bondage.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:13.380]   In the old covenant, it was a source of bondage because they had to leap over that to get
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.900]   to God and they could never leap over that.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.580]   But in the new covenant, it is a reward.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.780]   Holiness is a reward.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   Holiness is life.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:28.020]   And the Christian is most alive when he is living a holy life.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.180]   He's the most alive when he is praying.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:34.540]   He's the most alive when the word of God is sanctifying him.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.060]   Because we are no longer in the citizenship of the old kingdom.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.780]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.380]   That paradigm shift, it may just sound like semantics, but that's the difference between
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.940]   bondage and life.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.440]   That's the difference between rejecting sanctification and embracing it with all our heart.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.780]   That's the difference between running this marathon with joy and running this marathon
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.580]   always looking back, thinking you're missing out.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:07.420]   That's why worship is, worship can be a dread or it can be something we look forward to
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.180]   all week long.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.860]   If worship is something you have to do on Sunday, it's like, "Oh my God, how long is
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   I, 50 minutes?"
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.260]   You know, and then asking for money again.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.580]   It's like, "Hey, we need volunteers to put up the chairs.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.420]   You know, I'm working all week and I come to church and I got to set up chairs too?"
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.820]   Get it over with.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:35.020]   But if worship is what happens because you see joy in meeting Christ.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.500]   You know, today we have become a generation of people like, worship has to be led by Matt
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:47.100]   Redmond or Casting Crowns or, I don't know, those are the two people I know.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.940]   Keith Green is no longer around so I can't, you don't even know who he is.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:56.220]   If it's not led by these people and flashing lights and John Piper speaking or some of
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.940]   the John's speaking, right?
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.140]   If it's not done by the cream of the crop, it just doesn't do it for us.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.820]   If you ever have one of those situations, you go to a birthday party and they put it
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.500]   in, whatever gift that they gave you, you know, they put it in this elaborate package
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:21.300]   and you know, it's an iPhone 7, you know, package it up with a bow and then you open
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.700]   it up and it's like a $10 gift card and like, "Ah!"
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.700]   Right?
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.500]   You ever hear that happen?
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.380]   You know, like, so if the gift isn't that fantastic, you have to make the package look
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.860]   awesome.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.540]   But if it actually was the iPhone 6 plus, right, if it actually was something that you
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.020]   really wanted, you could give them in a plastic bag.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.820]   You almost want to give it to them in a plastic bag so that they're just like, "Hmm, what
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   is this?
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.820]   A plastic bag?"
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:53.620]   They open it up like, "You love me?"
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.100]   You know?
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:03.500]   If the product isn't good, you have to package it really nice.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.460]   Right?
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.780]   That's what's happened in our generation.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.700]   Because the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Spirit has been quenched, that we have to
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.300]   package the church in a way that they come and then what happens?
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.940]   They come in and say, "Wow, they have all this stuff."
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.260]   And then they come in there about a year and two years later, it's like, "Huh?
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.500]   $10 gift card.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.740]   I could have gotten that over there.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.100]   Went through all this to get that."
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:35.180]   But when Christ is at the middle, when the heart of the church is Christ, you know, some
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:40.940]   of the best worship that I've experienced was in strange places in the world with 100
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:46.540]   degrees inside, with wooden chairs, and no mic system, and the person gave two and a
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.700]   half hour message that I couldn't even understand.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.420]   And then in worship, people are, I mean, worshiping.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.420]   No one's thinking about anything.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.740]   I said, "Man, this is awesome."
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.380]   You come out of that thinking like, "Wow, that was worship."
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.100]   You know?
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.580]   Because all that, there was no package.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.820]   All they had was the product, the meat.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:14.700]   And so sanctification in our generation has become something we need to jump through,
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.660]   but not recognizing that it is the gift.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:24.340]   When you're walking right with Christ, some of you, you know, maybe you're struggling
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.460]   now, but you remember a period in your life when you felt the most peace and most joy.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:36.780]   If you're a genuine believer, and I'm confident that you will say the same thing I will say,
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.740]   you were the happiest and the most joyful and alive, not because you had the most money,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.620]   not because you were the most comfortable, but when you were at the center of the will
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   of God.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.340]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.020]   Come talk to me after the service like, "That's nonsense."
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.420]   You know?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.700]   When I went bungee jumping, that was when I was the happiest.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.700]   You know?
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:07.140]   Yelp had this 5.5 star, you know, and this sushi, and that was when I was the happiest.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.940]   If I'm wrong, come and talk to me.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   Right?
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.300]   I'm confident that your confession is the same as mine.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.540]   It was when you were at the center of the will of God.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.060]   And that's why He pushes them to sanctification.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.540]   He pushes them to love.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.360]   He pushes them to sacrifice.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.220]   Because in that we find joy.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.020]   Because this is His kingdom.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.700]   And we are His children.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.500]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:43.780]   Paul, his joy, it wasn't the sanctification in and of itself of it produced joy, but he
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.140]   was also mutually encouraged.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.420]   He didn't just do the, "Oh, it's my job."
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.260]   He said, "No, you do this because you're my job."
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.980]   First Thessalonians 2, 19, "For what is our hope or joy or crown or boasting before our
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.580]   Lord Jesus at this coming?
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.620]   Is it not you?
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.580]   For you are our glory and joy."
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.100]   Not only is our sanctification a source of great joy, but sanctification and fruitfulness
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.020]   in other people is great joy.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.420]   If any of you have ever experienced somebody coming to Christ because of you sharing the
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.620]   gospel, you know that there's nothing in this world like it.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.620]   Nothing in this world like it.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.700]   There's nothing you can compare to.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.340]   You can't travel to the remotest part of the world and come back and say, "It was kind
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.060]   of like when somebody came to Christ.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.940]   It was kind of like when my brother accepted Christ.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.740]   It was kind of like when my children or my good friend or my parents came to Christ."
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.260]   It's nothing like it.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.860]   Paul says, "You are my joy."
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:43.860]   And so Paul is pushing them to sanctification so that they may receive joy, and he's preaching
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.740]   the gospel that he may be filled with joy.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:54.300]   And for the sake of time, we want to give enough time for the communion, but the scope
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.180]   of his ministry, he says, and let me read from verse 13 all the way to 14 and 15, he
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.940]   says, "I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, but
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.540]   thus far have been prevented in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.340]   as among the rest of the Gentiles.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:13.540]   I am under obligation both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   the foolish.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.900]   So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome."
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.900]   Let me stop right there.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.820]   Paul uses the language, verse 14, "I am obligated."
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.380]   And so whenever we think of obligation, we think of burden, right?
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.980]   I'm obligated to do this.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.500]   But then look what he says in verse 15, "But I am eager to preach the gospel.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.740]   I'm obligated to preach the gospel, and I am eager to preach the gospel."
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.860]   Which is it?
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   Of course it's both.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.580]   He says both.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.220]   Obligation doesn't kill the joy.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.340]   He says, "I'm obligated, and all the more why I am eager.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.700]   I'm a husband.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.380]   It is my obligation to love my wife."
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.220]   You say, "Oh, obligation, that doesn't sound romantic."
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.220]   Right?
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.620]   He said, "That sounds burdensome.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.060]   You're obligated."
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.380]   But that obligation brings me tremendous joy.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.380]   I'm obligated as a father.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   I'm obligated.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.780]   And if I don't take care of them, what kind of a father are you?
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.340]   He said, "Oh, that must be burdensome.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.380]   My obligation is my joy.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.000]   My obligation is my joy.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.260]   My obligation to preach the gospel is my joy.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.220]   My obligation for the sanctification church is my joy.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.500]   That's the source of my joy."
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.300]   So we think that obligation somehow negates the joy, but Paul says no.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:39.820]   Some of the greatest joys in life are the things that you are obligated to do.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.020]   We're obligated to worship God.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.940]   But that's where we get the greatest joy.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.560]   We're obligated to preach the gospel.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.620]   But that's where we find the greatest joy.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.300]   We're obligated to live a holy life.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.680]   But that holiness leads to greatest joy.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.860]   And that's why Paul says, "You know what?
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:05.100]   I am eager to preach the gospel, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians."
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.620]   He's not limited to one group of people.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.580]   He says Greeks had a reputation of being, you know, they had the philosophy, they had
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.140]   the arts, they had the knowledge.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   I mean, they were known to be the sophisticated people.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.940]   And then you have the barbarians, right?
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.780]   Well Paul is saying, "I'm obligated to both."
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.980]   You know, we have a tendency to witness down.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.820]   You know what I mean by that?
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.420]   You go out, street evangelism, and you look for people that are a little bit less than
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.420]   you, at least in your mind.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.420]   You never say it.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.100]   You don't say, "That guy's worse than me.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.500]   I think I'm smarter than that guy.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.780]   I'm pretty sure I make more money.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.580]   I'm better looking, so that guy's going to hear the gospel from me."
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.980]   You go out and then you say, "Well, that guy's taller, stronger, better looking, more educated,
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.020]   older than me, better clothes.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.020]   He's my boss."
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   You know?
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:00.180]   You say, "I can't witness to him."
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.780]   So we have a tendency to preach the gospel down.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.020]   Because there's something inside of us that's relying upon our own effort, our own position.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.020]   Right?
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.060]   So if I happen to be elevated, then I can preach down because, you know, I'm so respected
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.580]   and I have all this money and everybody's looking up to me.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.420]   But as soon as we think somebody's a little bit higher, a little bit above us in any way,
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.260]   we say, "Ah, they're not going to take me serious."
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.620]   But what does Paul say?
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.860]   The power is in the gospel.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.780]   That's why in verse 16, "For I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.980]   unto salvation to everyone who believes."
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.020]   The power is not in you, it's not in me.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.980]   That's why he says, "It's my joy."
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.180]   Whether I'm preaching to the Greeks or to the barbarians, to the Gentiles or to the
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.180]   Jews.
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.580]   It's not about my position, who I am, my experience, my money, my intellect.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.580]   He said, "No."
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.980]   That's why Paul says in Corinthians, he said, "You know what?
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:43:01.340]   Your letters are strong, but your presence is unimpressive."
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.340]   That can mean two things.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.420]   One, he doesn't preach well.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:11.420]   You know, they're comparing with him to, who am I thinking of?
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.420]   Apollos, right?
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.700]   Apollos is the seasoned preacher.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.540]   You don't preach that well, you stutter.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.180]   Or he's just not good looking.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.220]   In fact, Paul is known to be a short, bald guy.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.820]   He walks in, he's like, "That guy wrote this letter?"
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.580]   Remember what Paul said?
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.980]   "When I came to you, I did not come with persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.060]   power of God."
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.140]   When I was with you, I resolved to know nothing but Christ crucified.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.300]   What is he saying?
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.980]   Whatever you think of me, that's not where the power is.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.360]   Whether you think of me high or you think of me low, that's not where the power is.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.060]   Whether you are Nicodemus or the Samaritan woman, the high will be brought low, the low
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.860]   will be brought high.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.220]   Because the entrance into the kingdom and the power that changes people's lives is in
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.580]   the gospel, not you.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.060]   Not me, not our technique.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:11.260]   So as a church, we need to be brought back to what makes us us.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.260]   What brings you joy?
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.020]   Why you were attracted to Christ in the first place?
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.100]   What justified you should be the same thing that attracts you, and that's the very thing
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.460]   that we ought to pursue.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.020]   That's, you know, all of that.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   Paul's laying all of that.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.220]   Before we even get to the message, right?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.900]   Know who you are.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.540]   Know what the message is.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:39.020]   Know what the ministry is and why we need to be doing this, that we may pursue this
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   with joy.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.500]   We're going to have time of communion, and obviously every time we have communion, it's
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:50.480]   an opportunity for us to reflect and to think about the very things that we're talking about.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.940]   We don't do this because you've earned your righteousness.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.620]   You don't come up here because somehow you've done the right things this week, so you deserve
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.620]   this.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.720]   Nobody comes up to this table because you deserve it.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.600]   So what we are celebrating this morning is what Christ has done.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.860]   We are celebrating justification.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:13.340]   But in the process of celebrating justification, we are to reflect deeply upon our pursuit.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.100]   Do you have unconfessed sins?
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.660]   It takes some time to confess it.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.660]   Do you have relationships?
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.580]   Do you have bitterness toward people that you've left unresolved and is causing this
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.940]   tension in the Holy Spirit to be grieved in your life, to take time to confess these sins?
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.860]   And so as you are ready, we're going to ask you one by one, if I can ask Elder Phil to
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.300]   come up and help me.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.780]   And then when you come, please, obviously if you're sitting right in the middle, you
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.100]   know, you're welcome to come, but again, it's going to cause traffic.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:45.020]   So if you, this side come this way, and this side come this way, and then grab your, the
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.500]   elements and then go down this middle aisle together so we don't cause this traffic here.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.100]   But at the same time, we want to encourage you, if you're not a Christian, you've never
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.900]   confessed your sins, to receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior, we ask you to sit in your
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:06.780]   place and not to come up because communion table is kind of like an anniversary, right?
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.540]   Baptism is the marriage.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.020]   So if you have not been baptized, we ask that you wait until you're baptized to come up.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.100]   But those of you who are ready, just be prayerful when you're ready, one by one, we're going
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.100]   to invite you to come up.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.980]   Let me read a passage with you as our team opens up.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.980]   And then again, be prayerful when you're ready, we invite you to come up.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.220]   First Corinthians 11, 23, "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you,
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.660]   that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed, took bread and when he had given
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.780]   things he broke it and said, 'This is my body which is for you.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.980]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:48.060]   In the same way also he took the cup after supper saying, 'This cup is a new covenant
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.500]   in my blood.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.660]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.460]   So as you are ready one by one, we ask you to come and take of the element.
