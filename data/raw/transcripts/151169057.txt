[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.840]   And today we're going to be touching on a momentous verse, a well-known, quite profound
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.840]   chapter.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.040]   But before we get there and read the segment, I do want to have you guys think about one
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.360]   word.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.040]   It's decision.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.560]   Okay, decision.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.200]   And decisions are hard to make.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.520]   For me, I feel like all of life's decisions, because I'm a bit of an over-thinker, are
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   kind of tough.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.000]   And even the easiest decisions seem really hard and stressful.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200]   For example, just picking where to go eat.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.600]   You know, throughout the week I meet up with a lot of individuals, and a lot of times we'll
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   get together and then we'll come and sit and we'll be like, "So where do you want to go
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.160]   eat?"
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.360]   And then the worst is, if the other person is indecisive, we'll just sit there.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.080]   "No, where do you want to go eat?"
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.640]   "I asked you first."
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.120]   And it just keeps going.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.880]   It's like, "Where do you want to eat?"
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.160]   And then you start narrowing it down.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360]   Okay, I'll pick five, and of the five, you have to pick one.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.200]   And they'll be like, "No, I'm going to be decisive, and I decide, you decide."
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.840]   And it's just like, "No, you can't do that!"
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   You know?
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.080]   And it just keeps going.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.200]   Now, an interesting scenario happens a lot, which is sometimes we'll meet up and we'll
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   start driving.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.400]   Have you guys ever done that?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.080]   You'll start driving, but you haven't decided where to go eat.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.680]   And then my stress level goes through the roof.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.280]   We're coming to a major intersection.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   We have to decide where to go, you know?
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   "Just decide!"
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   And the other person's like, "You decide, you're the pastor."
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040]   And you're like, "No, you just decide."
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   And then now our meetup has become discouraging.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.400]   But if you've ever felt that, the funny thing is sometimes you just kind of delay the decision,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.560]   and then you just let time go, and you realize you're wasting some time.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360]   Now, in that moment, picking a place to go eat, that's inconsequential.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.960]   I mean, at max, you get a little frustrated, you have a good laugh, and then you waste
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   five hours, you know, five minutes driving around, you double back to your restaurant.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280]   The thing about it is, I'm talking about a decision-making here where sometimes it's
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.760]   not inconsequential, but rather, the consequences are dire.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   You know, an airplane pilot would never just start flying and be like, "Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.240]   we're 5,000 feet in the air, and I don't know where I'm going."
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.920]   And it's like, "I haven't decided yet."
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   No, you don't do that.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.080]   A ship captain does not do that.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   Why?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.040]   Because the consequences of delaying your decision becomes dire for you and everybody
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.600]   else on board.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.260]   Well, we're going to touch upon the book of Joshua, and Joshua's last charge to the nation
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.260]   of Israel.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.960]   In the nation of Israel, they've come off a great season of victory and accomplishing
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.760]   what people have been waiting for, the promised land.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.360]   The book of Joshua is all about conquest, all about victory and battles, and then they
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.200]   get the land and they piece it out to the tribes.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.640]   But at the tail end of it, the tone is really severe.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.000]   The tone is intense, and Joshua is going to challenge the nation what to do when they're
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   in.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.280]   I feel like that's necessary for us because, you know, for us, there are daily spiritual
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.360]   decisions to be made.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.600]   Do you believe and realize that?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.480]   There are daily spiritual decisions to be made, but more than that, there are life trajectory
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.800]   decisions to be made.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.720]   There are decisions to be made about the course of your entire life that's going to dictate
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560]   and guide all the small decisions in your life.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.940]   And that's what we're talking about today.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.480]   As we read Joshua, he's going to challenge us that we need to make a decision, not simply
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.160]   about this year, not simply about the next decade, but the whole course of your life
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   before God.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   So let's take a look in Joshua chapter 23.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.120]   I'm going to read a lengthy section here, starting from verse 14 all the way down to
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.320]   verse 15 of chapter 24.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.240]   And this is what the word of God says.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.880]   "Now behold, today I'm going the way of all the earth and you know in all your hearts
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.760]   that in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the Lord your God
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.720]   spoke concerning you has failed.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.320]   All have been fulfilled for you.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.240]   Not one of them has failed.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.000]   It shall come about that just as all the good words which the Lord your God spoke to you
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.600]   have come upon you.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.840]   So the Lord will bring upon you all the threats until he has destroyed you from off this good
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.520]   land which the Lord your God has given you.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.940]   When you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and go and
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.320]   serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the Lord will burn against you
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.520]   and you will perish quickly off the good land which he has given you.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.720]   Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   and for their heads and their judges and their officers and they presented themselves before
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   God.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.160]   Joshua said to all the people, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, from ancient
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.320]   times your fathers lived beyond the river, namely Terah, the father of Abraham and the
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.580]   father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.580]   Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and led him through all the land
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.460]   of Canaan and multiplied his descendants and gave him Isaac.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.420]   To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.380]   But Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.520]   Then I sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst and afterward
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   I brought you out.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.900]   I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.380]   And Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.180]   But when they cried out to the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians and
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.980]   brought the sea upon them and covered them and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.060]   And you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.540]   Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan and they fought
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.980]   with you and I gave them into your hand and you took possession of their land when I destroyed
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.540]   them before you.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.900]   Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel and he sent
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.940]   and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.020]   But I was not willing to listen to Balaam so he had to bless you and I delivered you
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.500]   from his hand.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.380]   You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho and the citizens of Jericho fought against
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.380]   you.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.060]   And the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Gershite
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.180]   and the Hivite and Jebusite.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.620]   Thus I gave them into your hand.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.820]   And I sent the hornet before you and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.300]   you, but not by your sword or your bow.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.940]   I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities which you had not built.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.940]   And you have lived in them.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.060]   Your eating of vineyards and olive groves which you had not planted.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.660]   Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.380]   And put away the gods which your father served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.380]   Lord.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.260]   If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.660]   whom you will serve.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.180]   Whether the gods which your father serves which are beyond the river or the gods of
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.780]   the Amorites in whose land you are living.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.860]   But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.860]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:29.260]   Father God we want to ask for that your scripture and your word would inspire and move us.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.660]   God as we open up and examine your truth, we pray God that your living and active word
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.500]   examine us.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.940]   Father as this is a new year we pray that we would devote our time, our energy, our
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.140]   strength, our minds and our decisions to you Lord.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.020]   God that we would honor and please you.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.300]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.660]   Amen.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.460]   So we again at this time in the book of Joshua, the nation is gathered up and you notice what
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.460]   Joshua is doing.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.180]   He's gathered all the people together.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.980]   Just imagine that this is a, it's not just a gathering of four or five hundred people.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.060]   We're talking about a million people.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.060]   Okay.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.100]   It's not about hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.060]   And they're gathered together and they're in a place in which after having obtained
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.020]   the promised land, Joshua is talking to them and as he recounts how they got there, it's
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.180]   a momentous occasion.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.220]   Look what all that God has done.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.820]   And then as he recounts what God has done, he says, but there is this decision before
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:36.900]   you and he gives this incredible challenge that the nation in a time in which they feel
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.980]   victorious now has a decision to make.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:46.540]   And to give you a sense of how important and how intense this decision is, I want to build
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.700]   up the story for you and I want to show you how Joshua is making this perhaps the greatest
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.140]   moment of his own ministry.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.380]   I have a slide for you here and then I don't have a clicker, but I'm going to say click.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380]   Next one please.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380]   All right.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.340]   Please turn your Bible over to Deuteronomy chapter 11 and the story actually starts before
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.780]   they enter the land under the leadership of Moses.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   Okay.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.780]   So go over Deuteronomy.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:25.060]   In Deuteronomy chapter 11, verse one through three, this is what he says.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.060]   He says, you shall therefore love the Lord your God and always keep his charge, his statues,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.380]   his ordinance and his commandments.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.240]   Know this day that I am not speaking with your sons who have not known and who have
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.860]   not seen the discipline of the Lord your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his edge
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.500]   outstretched arm and his signs and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh,
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   the king of Egypt and to all his land.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   Okay.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.060]   What I'm highlighting for you there is Moses essentially saying, this is the charge I give
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.980]   you to the generation that's about to go into the land.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.540]   You need to obey God's commandments.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.300]   You need to abide by his will.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   Right.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.140]   And he mentions that this charge is not just simply for the kids.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.060]   It's multi-generational.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.500]   He's thinking beyond just you guys.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.980]   He's thinking over to the Jordan.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.980]   And so if you go over to the next slide real quick, what I'm going to highlight for you
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.380]   is this, that laser pointer.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.260]   Highlight for you is that this is ancient near east back in the time.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.940]   The area to which we're really focusing on through Deuteronomy is just right here.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   Moab.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   This is modern day Turkey.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.020]   Here's, you know, Palestine, you know, Israel right here.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.020]   That's Moab.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:47.300]   And if you go on to the next slide, what essentially happens is before Joshua and the conquest,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.220]   the victory of nation of Israel, they're in Moab here to the east of the dead sea.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.900]   All they have to do is cross over to the Jordan in order to get into the land of Canaan, the
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.900]   promised land.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.420]   But remember, Moses doesn't get to go in.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.420]   If you look at the next slide, this is a view, which I think is quite amazing.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.140]   I remember at the end of the book of Deuteronomy, God gave Moses an opportunity to go up to
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.220]   Mount Nebo and to look, and this is what Moses saw.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.180]   He saw the land, he saw the survey, and he realized this land is vast, this land is fruitful.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.100]   We need to get ready to go.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.780]   But he can't go.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.540]   He needs to prepare the generations so that they might go and be successful, that they
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.260]   might go and heed the will of God.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.220]   And so if you look, look down in chapter 11, and I'm going to start reading from verse
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.220]   22.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.060]   In verse 22, he says, "For if you are careful to keep all his commandments, which I am commanding
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.220]   you to do, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways and hold fast to him, then
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.580]   the Lord will drive out all these nations from before you and you will dispose nations
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.860]   greater and mightier than you."
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.860]   So he's saying, it all depends.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.860]   Are you going to obey?
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.900]   We're going to go into that land, you guys see it?
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.540]   But the thing about it is you need to obey, and if you do, God is going to work and fight
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.440]   on your behalf, and he's going to displace all these nations, mightier and more numerous
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   than you.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.420]   And let's go on, he says, "Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   yours.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.260]   Your border will be from the wilderness to Lebanon and from the river, the river you
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.280]   fade is as far as the Western Sea.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.140]   No man will be able to stand before you.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.100]   The Lord your God will lay the dread of you and the fear of you on all the land on which
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   you set foot.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:41.500]   As he has spoken to you, see, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.820]   The blessing if you listen to the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.660]   you today, and the curse if you do not listen to the commandments of the Lord your God,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.420]   but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today by following other gods which you
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.020]   have not known."
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.920]   You see this idea of the decision here, right?
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.200]   I have a blessing and I have a curse before you.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   What's it going to be?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.400]   And take a look, verse 29, "It shall come about when the Lord your God brings you into
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.880]   the land where you are entering to possess it, that you will place blessings on Mount
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.320]   Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal."
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.600]   For the moment, you notice that before the nation enters the promised land, you see the
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.920]   decision already there.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.140]   And Moses is preparing them and saying, "You need to obey.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.100]   And should you obey, here are the blessings.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.340]   And should you disobey, here are the curses."
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.700]   But notice the names of two interesting mountains.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.140]   That's weird.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.860]   You're giving a sermon and let's say I'm challenging guys and all of a sudden I was like, "Mount
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.260]   Carmel this and Mount Everest this."
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.800]   You're thinking, "Okay, what about those mountains?"
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.020]   It's as random as that.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.980]   But I want you to take those names and keep that in your memory banks.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.500]   There is Mount Gerizim, the blessings, Mount Ebal, the curses.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.980]   Because in the book of Deuteronomy, although we're in chapter 11, history doesn't change
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.980]   in the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.500]   They're sitting in one place in the plains of Moab and Moses is just teaching them and
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.840]   preaching to them and causing them to be stirred up so that they might obey and they might
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.500]   be successful in the new land, right?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.860]   And so this theme of blessing and curses continues all the way to chapter 27.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.020]   Please turn your Bible to Deuteronomy chapter 27.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.820]   Thank you.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.020]   Nice.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.860]   Deuteronomy chapter 27.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.940]   I'm going to read another lengthy passage.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.260]   Please follow along starting from verse one.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   In verse one it says, "Then Moses and the elders of Israel charged the people saying,
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.020]   'Keep all the commandments which I command you today.'"
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.900]   Guys, this is the pivotal command.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.980]   You need to abide by the command of the Lord.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.500]   "So it shall be on the day when you cross the Jordan to the land which the Lord your
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.900]   God gives you, that you shall set up for yourselves large stones and coat them with lime and write
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.020]   on them all the words of this law when you cross over, so that you may enter the land
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.700]   which the Lord your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.580]   As the Lord, the God of your fathers promised you, so it shall be when you cross the Jordan,
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:23.180]   you shall set up on Mount Ebal," there is Iron Mountain, "these stones as I am commanding
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.500]   you today, and you shall coat them with lime.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.260]   Moreover, you shall build there an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.900]   You shall not wield an iron tool to them.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.540]   You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of uncut stones, and you shall offer it
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.940]   on birth offerings to the Lord your God.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.540]   And you shall sacrifice peace offerings and eat there and rejoice before the Lord your
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540]   God.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.700]   You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very distinctly."
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.540]   The Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all the Israelites saying, "Be silent
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.940]   and listen, O Israel.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.900]   This day you have become a people for the Lord your God.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.780]   You shall therefore obey the Lord your God and do his commandments and his statutes which
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.460]   I command you today."
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.980]   Moses also charged the people that day saying, "When you cross the Jordan, ye shall stand
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.460]   on the Mount Gerizim," there's our next mountain, "to bless the people, Simeon, Levi,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.260]   Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:25.300]   For the curse, ye shall stand on Mount Ebal, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.380]   The Levite shall answer and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice, 'Cursed
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.500]   is the man who makes an idol or a molten image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.860]   hands of craftsmen, and sets it up in secret.'
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.620]   And all the people shall answer, 'Amen.'"
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.780]   And then he goes on with curse after curse after curse.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:52.180]   Scan your eyes to chapter 28, and he reiterates that on Mount Gerizim, these will be the blessings.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.620]   Now that the curses are said, here will be the blessings.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.460]   Now it shall be if you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful to do all his
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.540]   commandments which I command you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.420]   the nations of the earth.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.140]   This is a dramatic play.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.660]   This is a dramatic showcase.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.460]   Moses is not just sitting there saying, "Okay, this is what's gonna happen."
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:23.420]   In the book of Joshua, chapter 28, just for, oh sorry, chapter 8, just for reference, Joshua
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:28.940]   after crossing the Jordan, then after having conquest over the nation of Ai, I don't know
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.580]   how to pronounce that perfectly, but it's like A-I, and then after that conquest, Joshua
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.180]   says, "Everybody gathers and we gotta do what Moses said."
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.100]   He said, "Let me illustrate the picture for you."
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.540]   It's not like this, like, "Okay, half of you guys over here, and half of you guys over
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.540]   here."
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.220]   We're talking about the entire nation of Israel, right?
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.180]   Hundreds of thousands of people coming to this part of the mountain and coming to that
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.180]   part of the mountain.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.780]   Please turn to the next slide.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.380]   And this is a picture of modern day Shechem right here.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.160]   This on the left is Mount Gerizim.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.580]   This on the left, on the right is Mount Ebal.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.540]   And the people were standing in the middle, and as they were standing in the middle, Moses
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.300]   said, "You over here, you over there."
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.900]   Once the Levitical priest started to say, "And these are the curses when you disobey
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.380]   and obey, or follow an idol."
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.700]   And the entire nation would say, "Amen!"
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.260]   Imagine how powerful that is.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.460]   But here's the point.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.260]   Do you realize what a challenge?
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.260]   What an illustration.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:41.060]   I mean, coming to our passage in Joshua, Joshua, after having contact, gathered the people
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.900]   right here.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:50.460]   And just as Moses, before he is passing, before he is leaving the scene, before he's going
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.740]   to die, and he says to the people, "You need to decide who you're going to obey."
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.500]   Joshua says the same thing, and he shows them like this.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   "Here is the mountain.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.900]   Here is the mountain.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.180]   You can't be on both.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.180]   Choose!"
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   Wow!
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:12.220]   But the fact of the matter is, the sinful condition that perhaps a lot of people in
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.180]   this day have been in, is we want both worlds.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.180]   We want both.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   I would like to have it my way.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.980]   I would like to have my preferences, and if I can't obey the will of God, then let it
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.980]   be so.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:31.020]   That cannot be, because you cannot straddle two mountains that's a mile apart.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.860]   And so, if you go to Deuteronomy chapter 30, I know we're flipping around a lot of different
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.860]   places.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:43.100]   Deuteronomy chapter 30, Moses is giving this emphatic challenge to the nation.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.820]   There is a decision to be made, and this decision is grave.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.420]   Decision is not to be taken flippantly, but it has to be made.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   I'm going to read here in Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 15.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:03.540]   He says, "See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and adversity,
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.300]   in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.000]   His commandments, and His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.820]   and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land which you are entering to possess
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.140]   it.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.620]   But, if your hearts turn away, and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship to
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:29.460]   other gods and serve them, I declare to you today that you will surely perish.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.060]   You will not prolong your days in the land where you are crossing, and the Jordan to
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.460]   enter to possess it.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.180]   I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.380]   and death, the blessing and the curse.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.860]   So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, by loving the Lord
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.580]   your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.500]   For this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.380]   the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.140]   Do you see that?
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.100]   That there is a decision for the people?
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.980]   And do you see that?
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.940]   There is a decision for us.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.820]   In our time, there is a decision.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.900]   There's a decision of what are we going to do with our day, what are we going to do with
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.140]   our year.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.060]   But there is the overarching decision of the trajectory and the course of our lives
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.660]   that I started with.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:32.580]   We cannot just coast in the car thinking, "I'll someday decide where I want to go eat."
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.840]   For the warning is, should you do that, you will surely die.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.500]   And so in other passages of Scripture, many other prophets have said the same exact thing.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.340]   In a big old battle on Mount Carmel between the prophets of Baal and Elijah, the prophet
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.980]   of God, 1 Kings 18 verse 21, Elijah says this to the people after he had called upon the
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.540]   power of the Lord and the altar was burned.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.660]   Elijah came near to all the people and said, this is 1 Kings 18, 21, "How long will you
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.100]   hesitate between two opinions?
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.780]   If the Lord is God, follow him.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.180]   But if Baal, follow him."
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.300]   And sadly it says, "But the people did not answer him a word."
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.940]   There is a decision to be made and have we made it to remember that this decision is
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.140]   mutually exclusive.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.060]   You cannot have both.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.500]   It was Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter six who said that no one can serve two masters
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.540]   for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to one and despise
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.540]   the other.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.860]   You cannot serve God and money.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.820]   So there is a decision to be made and that is why Joshua makes the warning.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.340]   That's why Joshua gives us the emphatic command.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.900]   Just listen to it as I read this.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:58.860]   Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve him in the sincerity of heart and truth.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.700]   Put away the gods which your father served beyond the river and in Egypt.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.700]   Serve the Lord.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.100]   If it is disagreeable in your sight, in other passages, in other translations it says, if
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.140]   it's evil in your sight to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves today whom you will
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.340]   serve, whether the gods of your father serves which were beyond the river or the gods of
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.620]   the Amorites in whose land you are living.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.580]   But as for me and our house, we will serve the Lord.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:30.500]   I wanted to start off, you know, 2016, this first Sunday with remembering that there is
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.260]   this decision to be made regularly.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.860]   But also there is this challenge upon us that there is a decision to be made of an overarching
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:45.620]   decision of our lives, a paradigm that we create when we set it before the Lord.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.540]   Where this is going to be the standard, the rubric by which we make the other decisions
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.500]   of our lives.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.980]   And this is the kind of decisions he calls us to.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.700]   He asks us basically, have we made this decision?
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.220]   Who will you obey?
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.460]   Can we answer that?
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.180]   Whose will will you satisfy?
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.060]   Yours or God's?
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.220]   Who are you going to serve?
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.900]   In what context are you going to live?
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.060]   The flesh or the spirit?
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.860]   Are you going to be living a life of growing in the knowledge of God and the grace of God?
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.500]   Or will you be growing in the knowledge of the joy and knowledge of the world?
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.220]   These are decisions that needs to be made.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.580]   But the thing about it is, you guys can turn off the PowerPoint now.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.860]   The thing about it is, what I'm challenging you guys to do is actually verbalize a decision
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.940]   to God.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:45.020]   When was the last time you said such words and expressed, confessing with your mouth,
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.660]   that kind of expressed devotion to the Lord?
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.540]   When was the last time?
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.140]   And I know that's a daunting thing because sometimes making huge resolutions like that
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.140]   is hard.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.700]   It seems like the words are too lofty.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.940]   But Joshua, before the Lord, is saying these words.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.940]   Why do I believe it?
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.940]   When I read verse one of chapter 24, everybody was presenting themselves before God.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.700]   It wasn't just a powwow.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.260]   They were presenting themselves before the Lord.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.860]   And what they were hearing was the words of God.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.620]   My challenge to us this morning is, give the intention of your heart to God.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.300]   Perhaps you don't feel like it, perhaps you might fear saying things you might not satisfy,
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.940]   but give God the intention of your heart.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.020]   It's proper, it's right, and it's what God expects.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:47.900]   Can you imagine, you go to a wedding, and nowadays everybody starts to write their own
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.780]   vows, and a lot of times when I'm officiating I have a piece of paper out there open up
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.540]   and I give them, and they read this beautiful vow to each other.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.060]   But imagine if I took out a piece of paper and I said, "And ladies and gentlemen, now
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.100]   the couple will exchange their wedding vows."
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:10.380]   And the lady, the girl, the bride, opened up hers, sorry, I kind of was fishing for
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.260]   the words there.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.820]   And she starts reading and she reads off this beautiful thing about how she's going to commit,
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:23.460]   that she promises to love and cherish, to be faithful until death do us part.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:31.140]   And the guy, typically super short, he opens it up and he says, "You know how it is, girl."
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.780]   Can you imagine that?
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.300]   Can you imagine if you've ever been in a fight and you try to open your heart and say, "You
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.900]   know, I'm not angry, but I just want to express to you, this is how you hurt me, and this
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.620]   is what I think you should do to help this relationship reconcile."
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.020]   And the guy goes, "All right."
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.660]   "All right what?"
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.380]   What we want to hear is the expression and intention of the heart, "I understand, yes,
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.220]   I agree, that's exactly what I should do, that's exactly what I'm talking about."
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.860]   Verbally express, "Yes God, I might not in track record have obeyed everything so far,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.620]   yes God in 2016, I might not be able to fulfill every single opportunity to glorify you, but
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.940]   I will resolve right now.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:24.740]   I will decide as far as me and my household, we will serve you."
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.300]   That is a confession and a resolve to be made.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.380]   Don't be afraid of making that, and I challenge you to verbalize it, and I challenge you to
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.300]   verbalize it urgently.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:42.700]   This passage that we're reading, it teaches us that this decision is not only important
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.420]   and so emphatic, but it is urgent.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:56.780]   Let me read to you the next section of chapter 24 of Joshua, so turn back there in your Bibles.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:02.980]   Starting from verse 16, after Joshua makes his exemplary resolution, starting from verse
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.540]   16 it says, "The people answered and said, 'Far be it from us that we should forsake
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:13.780]   the Lord to serve other gods, for the Lord our God is He who brought us and our fathers
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.180]   out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did His great signs on our
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.540]   side and preserved us through all the way in which He went and among all the peoples
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.900]   through whose midst we passed.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.500]   The Lord drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.820]   land.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.660]   We also, we will serve the Lord for He is our God.'"
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.540]   But then take a look at this, verse 19, so the people are like, "Yeah, us too, we'll
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.980]   serve our God."
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.940]   Then Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the Lord for He is a
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.300]   holy God.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.460]   He is a jealous God.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.180]   He will not forgive your transgression or your sins.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.060]   If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do harm and consume
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.780]   you after He has done good to you."
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.740]   The people said to Joshua, "No, but we will serve the Lord."
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:07.500]   And Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.560]   yourselves the Lord to serve Him."
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.140]   And they said, "Yes, we are witnesses.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.580]   Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are in your midst and incline your hearts
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.580]   to the Lord, the God of Israel."
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:25.500]   The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the Lord, our God, and we will obey His voice."
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.860]   Did you notice what Joshua did there?
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   He made that emphatic call to a decision, "Choose."
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.980]   And then when the people said, "Yes, Joshua, we will serve the Lord."
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.980]   He said, "No, you can't!"
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.140]   It's like, "Wait a minute, what is that?"
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.420]   It's kind of like saying, "Oh, here, take this."
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.580]   And then somebody says, "Okay," and then he's like, "Ah!"
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.900]   That's how it feels like almost.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.340]   I mean, is that what Joshua is doing?
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:30:00.740]   No, I think what Joshua is doing is emphasizing the ramifications of the decision, how urgent
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   that decision is.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.940]   That decision is not a kind of decision to which you can say, "Yeah, I'll do it.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:13.020]   I'll serve the Lord, and in due time, eventually, I'll start growing."
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.860]   That's not what he's envisioning, is he?
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.780]   You see, the urgency of the decision does not come by because there's a timeline, but
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.380]   because next year at the end of 2016, something's going to happen and you won't have a decision
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.380]   anymore.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.500]   Although that could be.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.860]   Your timeline is in God's hands, and God's timeline is your timeline, so guess what?
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.940]   There is a chronological urgency.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.300]   But that isn't the main reason why there's an urgency.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   The main reason why there's an urgency is shown to us in verse 19, when he says, "You
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:54.420]   will not be able to serve the Lord for," this is why, "because God is holy and he is jealous."
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.180]   Do you see what he's saying there?
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.260]   He's saying essentially that because God is a God who is holy and God is a God who is
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.460]   jealous, you have to be sure of this decision.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.900]   God is a holy God, and he's not going to allow just time to pass.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:18.220]   The last year, however it was, however their track record was, as they were doing the conquests
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:25.300]   in the land of Canaan, cannot be in the future because God is a holy God.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.860]   Your intermingling affection for the world and the idea of having both, that cannot be.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.860]   Why?
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   Because God is a jealous God.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.660]   God has a timeline in which he has scheduled an appointment for us to give an account for
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660]   our lives.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.900]   And so that decision now carries with it a kind of urgency, a kind of weightiness because
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.380]   God is weighty and God is holy.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:52.300]   And that decision carries with it then the exclusivity because God is jealous.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:32:00.380]   Basically, Joshua is highlighting, do you understand the decision you are making based
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.460]   on the character of God.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.020]   He is a holy and jealous Lord.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.220]   So this is the decision that we don't make flippantly.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.020]   This is not a decision that we say, "Okay, sure, everybody else is doing this, I'm just
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.020]   going to sign off."
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.020]   Right?
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:21.660]   Now if I can speak to us honestly, you know, I genuinely believe that most of us here,
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:27.020]   we know that this decision is grave.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.060]   It's a serious one in a sense.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:40.060]   And perhaps sometimes we hesitate and we don't want to make resolutions and big lofty statements
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:45.700]   like, "God, I'll glorify you in 2016 and I want to serve you," and stuff like that because
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:50.980]   we know that's a serious thing to say.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.980]   What am I saying?
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:58.300]   What I'm saying sometimes, the greatest hindrance for us to make those resolutions before God
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.820]   is our fear of failure.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   We know that we shouldn't just simply say it.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.500]   We know the expectation is high.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.980]   We know that the standard of God is high, that He is a holy God.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.300]   And so we know that we shouldn't just say it.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:16.780]   And having perhaps done that in the past, we're now afraid.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.900]   But brothers and sisters, that is a bad application.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.660]   To stop yourself from committing to God and expressing and verbalizing your dedication,
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:33.420]   confessing your love, committing things to the Lord is not a bad thing.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.780]   Brothers and sisters, sometimes we're afraid of being hypocritical.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.700]   Once we fail, we feel like hypocrites if we're going to say, "God, I'm going to honor you."
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.980]   But it is not hypocritical to want to serve the Lord.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.260]   It is not hypocritical to humbly want to change.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.540]   If I'm not doing it now, God, I want to be doing it more in the next year.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.780]   You know what is hypocritical?
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.220]   There is a sense of pride in the people.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.740]   If you notice what they said, as soon as I read that, I was like, "Oh, far be it from
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.260]   us to forsake the Lord."
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.620]   It's like, "Oh, that's not us.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.980]   That is you."
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.220]   These guys always put God on second burner.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.420]   They get always compromised and God has always been forgotten.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:24.100]   But if you humbly recognize, "God, I have a tendency to get distracted with my life
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.700]   and I put you and your purposes behind, but I'm committing this day.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.100]   I'll keep you as priority.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.100]   I want to keep you as priority."
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.860]   That's a rendering of your intention.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.940]   That's not hypocritical.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.100]   That's needed in our lives.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.100]   You need to do it.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:49.020]   If you haven't done it lately, you are missing out on the joy of expressing to your love,
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.420]   to your Father, what you intend for Him and your relationship.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.660]   That's my challenge to you.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.500]   You need to overcome that kind of hurdle, especially for us who have the Spirit of God
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   and the grace of God.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.340]   You know in the New Testament, it teaches us in Titus 2 verse 11, it says, "For the
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.540]   grace of God, it brings salvation and has appeared to all men."
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:18.460]   The grace of God teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled,
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.920]   upright, godly lives in this present age.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.140]   It teaches us to make a decision.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.900]   No, yes, self-control.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.180]   That's what we have in the grace of the Lord.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:33.340]   And so he says, "This is the glorious appearing of the great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.940]   who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself a
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:46.380]   people that are His own, that are His very own, eager to do what is good."
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.460]   So are there things hindering you from making a resolution this year?
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.620]   You know there are other hindrances that we have.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:02.180]   Perhaps for you it's more of a just flat out wrestling with laziness and being intentional.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.100]   For some of us, it's we actually don't want to bear that cost.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.980]   We know there's going to be a cost.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.940]   We know that there's going to be a huge investment.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.460]   If I say this, there's going to be high expectation.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.660]   If I say this, it's going to be a lot of work.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.500]   For some of us, flat out, it's just selfishness in our heart.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.860]   We just hold off making a decision because just in case something better comes along.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.940]   You know?
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:31.180]   Why do we sometimes hesitate to make a decision about plans for the next weekend in case we
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:36.860]   can do something more and better, which is not always bad, but sometimes we do that.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.180]   Why do sometimes guys have a hard time committing to a lady in a relationship?
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.180]   Sometimes.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:50.740]   Selfishness, because sometimes they're potentially saying, "I could do better because I just
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   want more.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.060]   What could be?"
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.140]   And there is this delaying, this hesitancy of a resolution of a decision and a commitment
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.260]   because of many different reasons.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.460]   But I'm challenging us, overcome all those things.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.740]   Joshua, he's giving us an example.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:14.940]   Even if besides the cost, besides the crowd, he says, "You know what?
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.780]   You guys choose what you have to choose as far as me and I, our household, we'll serve
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.820]   God."
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.740]   Besides the personal failures, their track record is so bad.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.860]   And you know what?
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.180]   Let me just say, their track record is so bad.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.420]   I mean, their lives are just riddled with sin.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.100]   Starting from Genesis up until Joshua, it's just riddled with sin.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:39.820]   And maybe the resolution is needed more so because of the failures.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.420]   We're sitting here thinking, "Oh, because of my failure, I can't resolve."
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:49.620]   As a matter of fact, Joshua is presenting this question to a people who needs this question.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.580]   Who are you going to serve?
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:38:00.100]   Let's overcome those hurdles in our lives, our own selfishness, our own fears, self-doubt,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.260]   for the sake of committing and rendering to God a commitment and a heart that says, "God,
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.140]   you are my Lord and I'll serve you."
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.180]   Joshua's example is great for us to follow.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:19.500]   And again, in 2016, I pray that we would make preemptive decisions like that.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.380]   Before entering the land, we make decisions.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.660]   After entering the land, we make decisions.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.300]   Before spilling up the land and dissecting it to the tribes, he makes decisions.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.660]   We need to make preemptive decisions.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:38.140]   And let me just say, I think 2016 isn't like, "Oh, what's going to happen?"
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.500]   We all know what's going to happen.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.660]   I mean, practically and humanistically speaking, you guys all know what you're going to do
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.180]   in 2016.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.820]   For those of you guys in graduate school, you're just going to study all day.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.060]   You know?
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.740]   You guys did undergrad in graduate school.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.180]   You guys are like in a decade of school and it's just school.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.620]   And that's like the dominating factor in your life.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.180]   You guys know what's coming.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.180]   Don't be all surprised.
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.500]   Like, "Oh, you guys exactly know what's coming."
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   You know?
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   I got you all depressed.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.500]   Sorry.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.900]   For those of you guys who are working, the months and the days go by fast.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.380]   You know what your schedule is going to be like.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.180]   You're going to work and you're going to be tired at the end of the day.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.220]   And the year is going to go by just like this, just like 2015 went by like this.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.180]   Those of you guys who have families, you guys know the dynamics of family and you guys know
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   what's coming.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.220]   You guys know from talking to other families, looking at your own kids, if you have second
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.020]   or third or fourth, you guys know.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.460]   Okay, they're going to go through the frustrations of the terrible twos and you're going to know
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.220]   the frustrations of going to school and you're going to know what's going to happen in 2016.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.780]   It's not a huge question mark.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.580]   But the fact of the matter is you have a huge opportunity.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.980]   Make preemptive decisions.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.140]   How am I going to serve the Lord when I'm busy with school?
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.340]   How am I going to serve the Lord when I'm busy with work, when I'm tired?
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.660]   How am I going to serve the Lord with my family?
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:03.300]   You need to make preemptive decisions just like the men of God are preparing the people
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.940]   before we embark on this momentous occasion, before we come into the land.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.620]   Look at me.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.620]   It's here or there.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   Let's decide.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   Let's decide now.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Amen?
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.700]   I want to close with a thought as a conclusion.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.460]   You know, I talked about inconsequential decisions about going out to eat and stuff.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.580]   I'm not challenging us to all of a sudden all have personalities where we're decisive.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.860]   It's like, "Hey, you and I are going to have lunch.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.100]   I've already predetermined that we're going to go to the Poke Bowl.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.180]   That's how it's going to be."
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.100]   You know, I'm not telling all of you to be decisive people.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.900]   As a matter of fact, when it comes to things like food, defer to others.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   Let people have what they want.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.820]   It doesn't matter.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:54.060]   But when it comes to your spiritual life, when it comes to faith and the things of God,
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:59.940]   His purposes, let no remaining question mark exist.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.940]   Right?
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.980]   Don't dilly-dally and hesitate.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.020]   Be sure, be decisive, be determined and committed.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.020]   Amen?
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.260]   And the thing about Joshua as an encouragement example for us is this.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.620]   He was so determined, so bold in his statement.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:21.180]   He not only spoke for himself, but he spoke for his whole family.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.660]   And I pray that every single one of you would be like that.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.740]   That your commitment to God and your desire to serve the Lord this year would be so strong.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.100]   If I have anything to do with this, my family, my church, we will serve God.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.300]   That's how it should be.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   Let's bow in a word of prayer.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.980]   Father God, we want to thank you so much for your grace.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:53.500]   Lord, we thank you for your great love, which was exemplified through the leading and direction
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.340]   of the nation of Israel.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:00.580]   We thank you for your great patience as you waited constantly for people to come around
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.260]   to make a decision.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.940]   Lord, we waited for people to see what you were doing and to buy into your gracious redemptive
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   plan.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:15.980]   Father God, forgive us if we have been negligent, if we've been coasting, if we left decisions
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.340]   unmade.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.780]   But I pray, Father God, that we'd be challenged today.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.420]   Lord, that we would be for you.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.740]   That God, we would be dedicated to you.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:30.060]   We would offer everything we have, energy, time, strength, and more to your service.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.660]   God, you are a great Lord who loves us.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.660]   We thank you.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.660]   We love you too, Lord.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.660]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:35.660]   Amen.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.480]   Amen.
