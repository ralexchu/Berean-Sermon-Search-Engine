[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.200]   Hello, Berean family, my friends and family from NorCal, and those who are tuning in online.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   My name is Brian Chisaki, and I am a second year mechanical engineering student at UCI.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.200]   Today on this Easter Sunday, I have the privilege to be sharing my testimony of faith.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.760]   Growing up, I always assumed that I was a Christian, because I was fortunate and blessed
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.720]   to be raised in a Christian household.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.400]   I always did Christian things.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.920]   I was always around Christians.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.800]   I was active at church, and I also received a Christian education until the eighth grade.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.800]   However, despite all these things, and even saying the prayer in the first grade, I do
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.640]   not believe I was genuinely safe, as my life was devoid of any relationship with the Lord,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.560]   and my life and desires did not align with that of scripture.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.720]   This is evident as the appeal of church began to diminish in high school, where secular
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   and worldly thinking began to infiltrate into my mind and into my heart.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.040]   I began to prioritize my pursuit of academics, extracurricular activities, and ungodly relationships
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.600]   over the Lord.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.840]   Without even knowing it, I began to fall into sin and conformity to this world, as I would
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   indulge in my flesh, seek the thrills of life, and would eventually stop attending Bible
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.800]   studies or church activities, aside from Sunday service.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.920]   I lived a double life, where I put up a good church front, but be like the rest of the
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.300]   world when I was away from it.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.280]   As I entered college, I began to further walk down a path of sin and destruction.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.880]   I used the freedom I had in the dorms to engage in unwholesome and sinful activities, but
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   it was also here that, by the grace of God, a family friend of mine introduced me to Bruin
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.600]   Community Church.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.720]   I remember distinctly that the first time I attended this church, Pastor Peter preached
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.800]   on the wheats and the tares.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.660]   This sermon was shocking and profound to me, as the gospel was unadulteratedly preached
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.420]   to me in a manner that created unease and uncertainty whether or not I truly believed.
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.520]   As I continued attending this church, I was further challenged by the difficult sermons
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.020]   that were preached here, as I found more and more inconsistencies with my double life through
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.300]   scripture.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.500]   Though I may have been adding to my biblical knowledge and trying on my own accord to fight
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.460]   and kill sin, my heart was still so far removed from the Lord, and I was still so empty and
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.620]   so dissatisfied with my life.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.580]   But things change.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.100]   I remember that on this one day in fall last quarter, or last year, after ending a fight
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.700]   with my girlfriend at the time, I felt absolutely broken and alone.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.940]   To make matters worse, my roommates were away at some party, and I did not have anyone to
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.980]   talk to.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.300]   I was distraught because I had placed my identity and my hope in this relationship.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.220]   Hopeless and broken, I came before the Lord and prayed to him for peace and for comfort,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.340]   and in that moment, I had an epiphany about the love of Christ.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.340]   I recognized that if my feelings of longingness and love for my girlfriend were so strong,
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.800]   how much more does our heavenly Father have and long for us?
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.980]   How much more does he love us, and how much more do we hurt him when we sin and choose
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.260]   sin over him?
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.460]   Those questions hit me hard, and for the first time in my life, the depths of my depravity
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.940]   before a perfectly just and holy God became so crystal clear to me.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.860]   My eyes were opened, and I was absolutely humbled by the fact that our heavenly Father
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.780]   so graciously loved broken and undeserving sinners like me, that he offered his one and
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.740]   only son, Jesus, to die on that cross for my sins.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.940]   Knowing that Jesus is the only way, the only truth, and the only life, I decided in that
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.980]   moment to confess my sins before him and make Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior over my life.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.180]   Ever since that day, my life has slowly been changing and transforming to that of the desires
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.940]   of our Lord.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.900]   By his Holy Spirit, he has allowed me to better resist and kill sin and also ignited a passion
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.580]   and a fire to read and study his word.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.580]   It was challenging to trust and obey in him, but God proved sovereign and good through
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   it all.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.300]   By his loving kindness and the good and disciplining Father that he is, he allowed me to experience
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.760]   hardships of months in quarantining, ending and letting go of relationships, and experiencing
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.660]   tremendous heartbreak to ever draw me closer to him.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.540]   I am so thankful for the trials and tribulations that he placed in my life, for the testing
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:31.020]   of my faith has brought genuine perseverance, character, and assurance of salvation.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.460]   I stand here today to testify that I am truly a follower of Jesus, that he is my Lord and
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.220]   Savior over my life, and that I have been bought and purchased by the blood of Christ.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.700]   Though I know I will still stumble and I will sin again, I am confident of this very thing,
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.540]   that he who began a good work in me will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   Thank you and God bless.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   [Applause]

[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:37.620]   [Applause]
