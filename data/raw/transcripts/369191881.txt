[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   Starting this week, we are going to be starting a series, a topical series, and this topical
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.320]   series is going to be on our church's tenfold membership covenant.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.340]   Now I know a lot of you guys here have reviewed it, have seen it, and some of you aren't members,
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.480]   so you know, you're kind of wondering, "Oh, why are we going to be doing a series on that?"
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.500]   Well, because the way that we have framed our tenfold membership commitments, it really
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.460]   summarizes what we believe the Bible expects of your life in church.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.720]   It kind of summarizes what the scripture expects from you as a Christian trying to exercise
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.340]   your faith.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.760]   Now in order to introduce this, remember I want to remind that we have a very important
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.680]   fourfold vision for the church.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.160]   Collectively, as a body, we believe that these fourfold visions summarize for us the scripture's
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.680]   expectation on us as a community.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   The fourfold vision we've set up, written like this, that we are going to glorify God
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.000]   as the greatest ambition of our lives through worship, through scripture, through understanding
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   and equipping people with this truth, through building a community that reflects this character
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.360]   of holiness and love, and then we're going to be a witness to the rest of the world.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   Those are our fourfold visions that encapsulate what the scriptures say should be the regular
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.600]   pattern, should be the distinctive traits of this community, every community.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.240]   However, we have on top of that then, ten commitments, ten covenants that we ask people
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.760]   to sign off on when they become members here.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.960]   And the reason why is because in order to actually fulfill those visions, in order to
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.560]   actually execute or implement those visions, we have to have each individual Christian
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.760]   committed to walk their lives in the church.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.140]   We have to have individuals who are desiring to fulfill God's expectation for them.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.240]   So I want you to understand and present this series not by way of saying, "Hey, here are
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.600]   like ten just simple keys to become elite Bereans."
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.500]   We never presented it that way, that as though these are above and beyond what the scriptures
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.360]   expect of you, but rather, no, these are the things that the scriptures say is going to
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.160]   be a description of your regular pattern in the life of the church, should be the regular
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.920]   pattern for every Christian.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.140]   Okay?
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.560]   So with that said, today we're going to be starting with the very first of those tenfold
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.960]   commitments and covenants of the church membership.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.440]   And the first one is, "I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior."
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.160]   To introduce this first one, I have an interesting kind of thought I want you to engage with
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   me.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.560]   And that is thinking about this very strange and very sad phenomenon that I think is happening.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.400]   What is this very strange and very sad phenomenon?
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.680]   It's when somebody wants eagerly to have a personal relationship, but applies it in a
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   completely wrong way.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.600]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.520]   You take a personal relationship that you really, really want to have, and you apply
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.480]   it in a completely wrong way.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.160]   Let me give you an example.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.520]   Just think with me, okay?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.420]   For me, I have certain personal relationships that are true of me.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.000]   These are things like, I'm a husband, I'm a father, I'm a son to my parents, I'm a pastor,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.220]   I have these distinctive roles, right?
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.540]   But these roles are not isolated tasks that I do.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.560]   These roles are relational roles.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.000]   So that's what I mean when I say there are these personal relationships.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.280]   Now let me apply it in the wrong way.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   Can you imagine if I tried to apply my husband relationship with you?
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.840]   So you're at church minding your own business, maybe you're participating in our cleaning
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.240]   crew and you're just cleaning the window.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.760]   And here I come, it's gonna be cringy, and I come around and I wrap you from behind with
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   my arms, and then I sniff your hair and I say, "Hey, baby."
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400]   Okay.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.160]   Now if I did that by accident, I mean, ha ha ha, we'll laugh about it for a long time.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.520]   But imagine how strange, how weird, how off it would be if I meant to do it.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.880]   And I tried to actually apply my husband role with you, right?
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.920]   That would be inappropriate.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480]   You slap my hand away, like, "What are you doing?"
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   And even if I said, "I wanna take care of you," it would make it worse, right?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.240]   It would be even worse.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.080]   Now I wanna give another example, which is I want you to imagine...
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.120]   Let's stop imagining that.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.680]   Let's go to something different.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.800]   Imagine if, because I'm a father, I wanted to apply my personal relationship that I have
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.480]   with my son with you.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.080]   And so you're minding your own business, maybe you're participating by, you know, one of
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.160]   the events that we just had, which is picnic day, and you're just out there playing games.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.640]   And I come around and I was like, "You're so cute."
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   And I just start ruffling your hair.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.280]   And you're looking at me like, "What did he just do?"
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.360]   And for those of you guys who are older than me in this room, how would you feel?
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.640]   Would you be like all warmed and say, "Aw, he thinks I'm cute," right?
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.400]   Or applied in the wrong way, actually, it would be very offensive, wouldn't it?
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.320]   Like pinch your cheeks, slap you on the butt, and say, "Go do your homework," right?
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   How would you feel?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It would not only be...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.800]   In the first scenario, when I applied the husbandry to the wrong individual, inappropriate,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.600]   strange, like cringey 7,000, you know?
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.900]   Over here, offensive, wrong, very condescending, yes?
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.600]   So I'm talking about a strange and very sad phenomenon that's potentially inappropriate
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:12.680]   and also offensive, but I do believe in history, Christian history.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.360]   In modern-day Christianity, this strange and sad phenomenon happens all the time.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   And you know what I'm talking about is when an individual presumes their relationship
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.840]   with God, treats God according to what they think and wish, but they're not really sure
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.200]   where they stand with the Lord.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.600]   Here's an example from the Bible, Matthew 7, verse 15 through 23.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.840]   Okay, Matthew 7, verse 15 through 23.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.640]   The scriptures say this, "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.840]   but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.680]   You will know them by their fruits.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.440]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.400]   So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.280]   A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.560]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.120]   So then you will know them by their fruits.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.440]   Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.820]   does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.520]   Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.800]   name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.640]   And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.280]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'"
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.200]   That is beyond strange, that is beyond cringy, it's wrong.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   But clearly it happens, and it will happen.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.160]   It's strange and it's difficult because they will say, "Lord, Lord."
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.720]   It's strange and it's difficult because they will actually do the actions and be confused
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   like, "But we did your work.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.320]   We did spiritual work.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.680]   We were doing kingdom ministry, weren't we?"
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.920]   And Jesus will say, "But I never knew you.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.560]   I never commissioned you, and I don't think you know me."
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.800]   That would be incredibly, incredibly off.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.560]   And so by this introduction, I want to highlight something for you, is that in the context
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:25.040]   of talking about Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, we are talking about a relationship.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.640]   When you sign off on the document, yes, you are signing off on a doctrinal statement.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.040]   Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior, but it is more than a doctrinal statement.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.520]   It is a status of your relationship with Christ.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.800]   And the context by which we're talking about this is in the world right now and throughout
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.760]   history, there has been confusion and a strange phenomenon, and the error has been presumption.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   Okay, let me repeat that.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.720]   The error has been presumption.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.360]   People have mistakenly presumed a relationship with God they did not have.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   People have presumed and then also then asserted their own desired relationship with God.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.080]   "God, you do this for me.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   God deliver us.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.000]   God, win this battle for me.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.080]   God, X, Y, and Z, I have expectations of you that I think you're obligated to do for me."
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   But that is not the case.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.320]   God regularly says, "I'm not a man that I should be bribed by you.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   You don't buy my affection.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.120]   You definitely don't buy this relationship.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.200]   You don't demand it."
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.160]   This is something that is a unique privilege that cannot be assumed.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.680]   But unfortunately, I believe this is the case.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.760]   So as we talk about this first covenant that I confess Christ as my Lord and Savior, it
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.520]   is such a huge topic, but I want to focus on this truth, and I want to remind you that
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.600]   the reason why our church goes over this is not to make you feel like, "That's right.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.520]   If you want to be a member, you better show up and represent."
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   Right?
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.000]   Because I have had people tell me like, "Man, you know, Berean expects a lot out of his
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   members."
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.120]   And I always want to say, "The Bible expects a lot out of men."
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.680]   It's not just that Berean wants you to be some kind of elite Christian, and you have
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   to measure up to these things.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.020]   No, I want to explain to you our heart.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.080]   We do not want you to be mistaken about where you stand with Jesus, because that is to you
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.920]   the greatest good.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.480]   And then to you on the reverse side of that, for you to stand confused about whether God
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.960]   accepts you, for you to stand confused about whether He is your Lord, that would be to
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   you your greatest tragedy.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.880]   I believe it.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.120]   And so our heart is to minister to every single person who desires to be a member here.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.520]   We want to give you clarity so that you stand with God, not in your own confidence, but
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.120]   by faith, confidence in the Lord who accepts you because of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.280]   That kind of assurance is the desire of Scripture for you to have, and that to you is going
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.720]   to be the greatest foundation for everything you do.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.840]   And that's why this is covenant number one.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.360]   So with that said, I want to set a second kind of background to this.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.080]   So this is introduction part two, which is, I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.160]   then is at the greatest importance, that you get it, you understand it, and you see the
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.240]   full picture of the relationship you have with Jesus.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.000]   But then one might say, "Hmm, why do you word it like that though?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.160]   Isn't it sufficient for you to say, 'I have been saved by Christ through faith,' period?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   Why do you have to add this idea that He's your Lord and Savior?"
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:50.000]   Now you understand, in setting up the context, that in our modern generation, there has been
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.680]   some wayward theology that had to be corrected.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.800]   Okay?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   Meaning just bad thinking that needs to be fixed according to the Bible.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   What is that?
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.720]   I want to quickly summarize it for you because I believe the vast majority of you in here
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.920]   probably have already heard the term "Lordship Salvation."
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.800]   Right?
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.840]   Lordship Salvation has been a certain issue, a controversial issue, perhaps in more recent
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.360]   history, meaning more like the last 15, 20 years.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.720]   But let me summarize why there was this even need to say Lordship Salvation and not just
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   salvation.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   Because it should suffice.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.120]   If Jesus is Savior, that's it.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.260]   But the reason why is because there were some thought.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.840]   I have here a summary that says, number one, you cannot divide Christ's character.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:42.040]   Meaning there were some people who believe that you can accept Jesus as your Savior,
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.760]   but not yet be ready to accept Him as Lord, and that's okay.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:53.500]   Meaning I could accept Him as my Savior to deliver me from hell, but it does not necessitate
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.000]   that I accept Him as my Lord yet.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.280]   And so there were some people who give their testimony, and they give a sequential testimony.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.200]   Well, here I accepted Him as Savior.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.720]   I was kind of running away and doing a Jonah thing, and then I really decided to follow,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.680]   and then later on I realized I have to make Him my Lord, and so I made Him my Lord here.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.840]   That kind of thinking is not biblical.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   Why?
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.800]   Because the person of Jesus Christ, He's one.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   You cannot simply accept and then reject parts of Him.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.000]   He cannot be divided.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.960]   Two, you cannot divide your own relationship with Christ, meaning you cannot refuse Him
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.280]   and have Him at the same time.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.560]   You cannot persistently refuse His commands, accept sin in your life, be unwilling to forsake
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.920]   your previous life, and then say, "But I want Him here."
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.320]   That's your relationship to Jesus that you cannot compartmentalize.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   That is also absolutely unbiblical.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.560]   And then what kind of by deduction ended up happening in the church, and perhaps maybe
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.720]   they were well-intending, but it's really bad theology, was that people have divided
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.180]   the Christian people.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.680]   You cannot divide Christ's people.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.320]   There had been an effort to say, "You know, we have cardinal Christians, we have converts,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.360]   we have babies, and then you have disciples."
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.600]   That is not a biblical thought.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.640]   Do you see how that kind of computes?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.960]   If you believe you can only accept parts of Jesus, if you believe you can relate to Him
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   only in parts ways, then you have to also make part categories of the people of God.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.320]   You have converts and you have disciples, and some people think that way.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.900]   That is unbiblical.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.640]   If you're not a disciple following Jesus, you're not a convert.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.200]   That is at the heart of when we say lordship salvation.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.040]   And again, remember I said, although as I run through this, that might be a lot, and
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.560]   also it might sound intense, this is not to say that Berean has this unique elite standard
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   for Christians.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.920]   This is how Scripture speaks.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.400]   And the way I want to prove that to you is not talk about, "Okay, let's talk about the
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.520]   Christian when he does, let's talk about how salvation works, let's talk about modes of
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   belief."
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.480]   What I want to talk about is Christ the Lord.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.160]   Because what we're saying is, when I say I confess Jesus as my lord and savior, that
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:21.920]   is not just a doctrinal statement, that is my relationship with Christ as I understand
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.940]   him and who he is.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.800]   And who he is is going to dictate everything of what I believe and what I do.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.320]   So let's follow along now into that trail of thought.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.080]   I begin with this number one point, which is Jesus Christ is Lord, and this is the greatest
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.120]   picture of him.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.000]   The greatest picture, when you think about the gospel, the message of truth reveals to
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.200]   us spiritual realities that we did not know before, and the biggest piece of that gospel
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.920]   message is not, "How do I get to heaven?"
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.280]   The biggest piece of that gospel is, "This is God."
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   That's what I mean.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.440]   And what I would like to also say is this idea that Jesus is Lord is the most natural
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:16.760]   and prevailing designation and picture of Christ, above and beyond his servanthood and
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.320]   above and beyond his humility.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.720]   That's really interesting.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.680]   What I need to do is prove that to you by scripture.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.440]   So now we're going to walk through a bunch of Bible passages, and I want to forewarn
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:34.920]   you, this sermon has long excerpts from scripture, so we'll need to follow along together.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.500]   The first passage I have for you is from Isaiah 9, verse 6 through 7.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.620]   What I like to say is, prior to Jesus being born, clearly there have been prophecies and
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.740]   introductions and teachings about Jesus.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.820]   The primary picture that those prophecies tried to teach God's people was that this
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.220]   Messiah is going to be Lord.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.220]   What does it say in the Bible?
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.480]   "For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us, and the government will rest
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.020]   on his shoulders, his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.820]   Father and Prince of Peace.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.140]   There will be no end to the increase of his government or of peace, and on the throne
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:20.320]   of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.020]   From then on and forevermore, the zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this."
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.200]   Wow.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.660]   People could camp out and meditate on that, but if you just ask the question, "What is
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.280]   the picture?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.720]   What is the impression of the Messiah to come?" and you would immediately say, "He's going
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   to be one amazing king."
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.440]   Righteousness and everlasting kingdom.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.120]   That's what you would think.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.920]   What's more, when he was actually born, he was announced as Christ the Lord.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.640]   Luke chapter 2 verse 11, the scripture says, "When he was born, for today in the city of
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:05.840]   David there has been born for you," look at these titles, "Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.440]   Remember that Christ is not Jesus' last name.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   Okay?
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.120]   I know you know that.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.400]   Christ means the anointed one.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.160]   He is the Messiah.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.800]   And to say he is the anointed one already gives you the picture of one who is like a
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.840]   king, the anointed king.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.440]   He is the Lord.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.760]   What's more, while he was doing ministry on earth, so many people literally wanted him
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.480]   to be king right now because that's what they expected.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.800]   This isn't this verse, John 6, 15, says, "Jesus perceiving that they were intended to come
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.160]   and take him by force to making king, withdrew to the mountains."
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.900]   But the other passage is Matthew chapter 16, verse 13 through 16.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.620]   This is when Jesus is talking to all the disciples and it says, "Now when Jesus came into the
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:58.140]   district of Caesarea Philippi, he was asking his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.640]   of Man is?'
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.500]   And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, and others Elijah, but still others Jeremiah
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.980]   or one of the prophets.'
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.420]   He said to them, 'But who do you say I am?'
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:18.500]   Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'"
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.200]   If Christ is a designation of the one who is prophesied, the anointed one, the Messiah,
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.660]   the Son of God actually takes it to the next level, right?
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.740]   He is not just the messenger of God, he is the Son of God.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:38.860]   And if you're thinking appropriately, you should be thinking the prince of the world,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.860]   right?
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.860]   One with authority, power, and the glory of the Father.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:50.140]   Now continuing forward, even when Jesus is about to die, you recall that Jesus was before
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.540]   Pilate.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.740]   Jesus himself acknowledges and affirms he is a king.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.020]   John chapter 18, verse 36 through 38, Jesus says to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   world.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.380]   If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.900]   But now my kingdom is from another place.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.020]   You are a king then."
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.700]   That is the right conclusion.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.780]   And Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.660]   In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.300]   the truth.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.540]   Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.340]   Think about that.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:40.980]   Jesus prior to coming on the scene, living on earth, and upon his even death, he is king.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.020]   And upon Jesus' resurrection, Thomas' affirmation is so profound.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.820]   In John chapter 20, verse 28, this is what the scripture says.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.500]   "Then he said to Thomas, 'Reach here with your finger and see my hands, and reach here
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.260]   with your hand and put it into my side, and do not be unbelieving, but believing.'
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:06.980]   Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord, my God.'"
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.500]   That is an amazing affirmation by Thomas.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.060]   And Jesus did not reject that.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.500]   I want you to think about that because currently right now, we have the resurrected Lord.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.540]   And so what I'm going to say is, there is a picture of Jesus that has been given to
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   you.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.500]   There has been a picture of Jesus that has been given to the people before us.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.860]   And all through the entire full spectrum of the picture, the picture has been that Christ
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.480]   is Lord.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:45.820]   The future enemies of God from here forward about things to come reveals to us that Jesus
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.820]   Christ is going to be revealed as the king.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.520]   Revelation chapter 17, verse 12 through 14 says this, "The ten horns which you saw are
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.980]   ten kings who have not yet received the kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.900]   beast for one hour.
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.220]   These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.480]   These will wage war against the lamb, and the lamb will overcome them because he is
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:16.120]   Lord of lords, king of kings, and those who are with him are called and chosen and faithful."
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.040]   The picture of what Christ is going to be revealed as is Lord of lords and king of kings.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.000]   And before I read this next passage, which comes from Revelation chapter 19, verse 11
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.900]   through 16, I just want to reiterate so that you understand what I'm saying.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:37.980]   Not just a picture of Jesus in history, not just a future picture of Jesus that's going
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:44.920]   to come by way of prophecy, but I believe the most appropriate, most prevailing picture
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.280]   you should have right now in your mind when you think Jesus is this.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.020]   Is it true that yes, Jesus is a humble servant?
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.020]   Yes.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.980]   Scripture tells us to be humble just like him.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.140]   But the picture we have cannot be so limited to a box.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.100]   And if you grew up maybe in a Christian home, you might have had that picture of Jesus where
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.780]   his skin is fair, his hair is perfect, and he's right at the door about to knock.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780]   Right?
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.280]   You guys had that picture?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.500]   I had one in my home on the wall.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.780]   Now that picture comes also from Revelations where the whole idea is he's ready to knock
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.480]   on the door of your heart so that he might come in.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:32.180]   The thing about it is this is also an accurate picture of Jesus that you should have in your
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180]   mind.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.100]   Where is the painting of that on the wall?
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.900]   Let me read it.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:42.940]   And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he who sat on it is called faithful
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.500]   and true.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.580]   And in righteousness he judges and wages war.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.140]   His eyes are a flame of fire, on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.140]   on him which no one knows except himself.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.660]   He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.900]   His name is called the Word of God.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.620]   And in the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.680]   him on white horses.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.380]   From his mouth came a sharp sword so that with it he may strike down the nations.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.060]   And he will rule them with a rod of iron and he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.260]   of God the Almighty.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:27.540]   And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings, Lord of lords.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.140]   This is a challenge to you.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.700]   Whether you've been a Christian a long time, whether you've been Christian a short time,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.500]   this is the image of God that is given to us at the end of the Bible.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:46.300]   We are looking forward to not eternity and long, long times ahead.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.780]   We are in what's called the last hour.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:54.460]   There's not a whole lot on the plan of God left, right?
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.200]   This is then to us the closest picture of Jesus we should expect.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.420]   Have you thought of Christ this way?
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:08.060]   This all matters because in summary, the proper way to view God, the greater picture of Christ
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:15.940]   is him as Lord, the Son of God with absolute authority, power, strength, glory, and dominion.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   That's the truth.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.500]   And it is that Lord who saves.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.380]   It's that Lord who lavishes love.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:29.380]   It's that Lord who has come down so that we would be lifted up.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:35.820]   That kind of great contrast is where we find the amazing part of the gospel.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.660]   To such great sinners, such great grace by such a great Lord.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.360]   I want you to think about that.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.960]   And what's more, not only is it because of this depiction of Jesus, but God says this
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.000]   is his very purpose.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.500]   Turn your Bibles over to Philippians chapter 2.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.160]   I know some of you guys are memorizing, so I want you guys to recite it now.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   I'm testing you.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.020]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.380]   We're walking through Philippians and this portion of it, we have to understand the purpose
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:14.200]   of God in salvation is actually for this very point that we're making to understand Christ
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   as Lord.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.340]   I'm going to start reading.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.080]   Ephesians chapter 2 verse 9 through 11 says this, "For this reason also God highly exalted
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.220]   him, bestowed on him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:33.060]   knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, that every
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:41.540]   tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:49.560]   If any of you are wrestling with that theology of, "But wait a minute, isn't salvation just
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:56.140]   simply by an easy kind of like simple request to have salvation, to have heaven?"
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.320]   My answer is going to be yes.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:05.140]   But this concept gives you a fuller picture that the purpose, the purpose that God is
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.720]   trying to accomplish is not devoid of your salvation resulting in the praise and glory
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.120]   of Christ as Lord.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.080]   And so if you dissect the two and say, "No, I can have salvation outside of his Lordship,"
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.200]   you missed the whole point.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.360]   That's my admonition to those individuals who think, "No, no, no.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.640]   Salvation is supposed to be a free gift and I'm supposed to be able to receive it.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.320]   And if you add anything to it, you're a legalist."
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:42.080]   I'm going to say, "Man, it's hard to debate you when you missed the whole point.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.200]   I'm not arguing with you.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.680]   When I say you, I'm not talking about you.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.600]   I'm talking about the person I'm picturing in my head.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.200]   Salvation is by faith.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.480]   It's that simple.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.440]   You humble yourself and you ask God Almighty, "Forgive me.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.360]   Give me your grace."
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.120]   So yes, could someone be saved right now, today, in this moment?
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.480]   And the answer is yes, because it is not of your works.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.800]   It is by grace.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.720]   But if you do not understand the one who's giving you the grace, the one who's giving
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:21.760]   you the entire context of why you could even ask, you missed the whole point.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.880]   And so, when we talk about this lordship of God, I am saying and challenging you, how
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.560]   do you perceive the Lord?
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.680]   Because that predicates how we're going to do everything else.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.800]   And therefore, if you have this limited view of Jesus, where perhaps He is just a giving
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.040]   tree, He is the one you go to and you pray, "Lord, could you please grant me this?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   Lord, help me this and help me that.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.320]   Lord, please help me with school, work, family, and every single hurdle that comes my way."
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.280]   There is a fine line between dependency and a fine line between abuse.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.880]   "I want you to give me this.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   I want you to give me that.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.120]   I want you to give me this."
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.080]   If you just see Jesus as a comfortable friend that you go to for companionship when you're
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.280]   lonely, if you just see Jesus as a love interest where you sing wonderful songs and you engage
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:17.200]   in romantic kind of relationship, I'm going to say, "Christ is so amazing.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:23.440]   He can provide all of that, but don't miss the bigger picture.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:31.040]   Christ is Lord, King of kings, Lord of all, and this matters because by the nature of
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.360]   who He is, then it has natural ramifications of our response.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.460]   Because He's Lord, I don't get to just ask for stuff.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.120]   Because He's Lord, now it demands me to give praise.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.600]   Now it demands me to give my service.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:54.120]   It demands me to give actually all of myself in trust because it is a unique, unique privilege
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.320]   for me to have His Lordship and His reign.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:06.120]   Because He's deserving, now I am able to subject myself to Him and joyfully obey.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.520]   This relationship now takes on an incredible, new, dynamic kind of interaction.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   Why?
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.880]   Why?
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:23.520]   Not because of modes, not because of this and that, but because simply of who He is.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.300]   And I believe the grave, grave mistake, again, of that kind of theology that has been prevalent,
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.840]   you kind of missed the big picture.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.400]   And so here's an interesting thing that I was thinking about, which is, do you remember
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.160]   the passage in John chapter 3 where the rich young ruler comes in and he asks Jesus, "Rabbi,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   you're a good teacher.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.640]   I want to ask you.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.880]   I've done everything, but how do I get into heaven?"
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   Is that a good question?
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.240]   The answer is yes.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.600]   Everybody should ask that.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.680]   But for this man, his biggest problem was not that he was so wrong about how one gets
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.600]   into heaven, because I think he knew you needed a certain level of righteousness.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.720]   He should have instead asked, "Lord, who are you?"
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.400]   His mistake was he presumed he knew this teacher.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.600]   I know you're a good man.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.200]   I know you're a worker of miracles.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.560]   I know God is with you.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.360]   But I think you have some special knowledge that'll help me get there."
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:26.520]   The problem is that person should have asked, "Lord, clearly you have come for a purpose.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.240]   Who are you?"
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.900]   Those that Jesus commends for faith are the ones who recognize, "You're a Lord.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   You have authority.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.680]   Just say stuff and I know it's going to happen."
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.520]   And Jesus says, "That's right."
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.760]   He commends that kind of faith.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.360]   What needs to happen is there has to be this eye-opening realization that Christ is Lord
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   and that predicates then everything else that happens afterwards, and that's my point.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.980]   So I want to move now to point number two.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:04.320]   If we understand that Christ is the big picture, His Lordship is a greater image, then the
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.760]   drama of that picture, the action of that picture is reconciliation.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:16.120]   See, if you don't understand Christ to be this Lord, then yeah, of course.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.640]   Of course I'm going to be with you.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.440]   Of course I'll accept your offer of grace.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.560]   Of course I'll accept your offer of heaven.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.160]   Why would I not?
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.320]   It just makes sense.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.920]   But when we recognize that Christ is Lord of Lords, we now all of a sudden feel the
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.440]   chasm, and there has to be a reconciliation of this chasm.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.360]   Unless you understand who Christ is, you're not going to appreciate the bad news of the
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.800]   gospel, or so the primer of the gospel, which tells us of this existing chasm between us,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.740]   and the scripture says we have to reconcile, we have to deal with God, before whom we have
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.740]   to give an account.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.520]   What I'd like to do is share with you John 8, verse 31.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   Please turn your Bibles there.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.960]   It's a long passage, and we're going to walk through it.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:12.120]   Jesus Christ is doing this very work, trying to reconcile the Jewish people to the Lord.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.180]   And what he's going to say is, "You listen to my word.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.920]   You follow me."
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.960]   And what's very interesting is the very sin that I'm trying to present to you today, the
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:27.320]   sin of presumptuousness, the sin of assumptions, the sin of thinking you have a relationship
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.460]   that you don't, is prevalent through this entire exchange.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.420]   So John 8, verse 31, this is what the scripture says.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.240]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed him, "If you continue in my word,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.480]   then you are truly disciples of mine, and you will know the truth, and the truth will
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.440]   make you free."
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.540]   They answered him, "What?
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:54.540]   We are Abraham's descendants, and I've never yet been enslaved to anyone.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.820]   How is it that you say you will become free?"
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.220]   Pause there for a moment.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   That's a lie.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.380]   I mean, if it's a Jewish person, they should know.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.100]   It's like, "Have you ever heard of a thing called Exodus?
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.380]   Remember, there was a time of slavery?"
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.900]   That's a lie, right?
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.420]   In verse 34, Jesus answers them and says, "Well, truly, truly, I say to you, everyone
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.780]   who commits sin is a slave to sin.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.980]   The slave does not remain in the house forever.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.500]   The son does remain forever.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.940]   So if the son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.860]   I know that you are Abraham's descendants by flesh.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.980]   Yet you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.940]   I speak the things which I have seen with my father.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.420]   Therefore, you also do the things which you heard from your father."
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.060]   They answered and said to him, "What?
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.440]   Abraham is our father.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   Do you see the presumption?
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.980]   Do you see the false confidence?
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.460]   Do you see the assumptions?
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   What?
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.760]   We're the people of God," right?
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.820]   And they're going to expose who they are even more.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.700]   Going forward, Jesus said to them, "If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:04.620]   But as it is, you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.900]   from God.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.380]   This Abraham did not do.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.240]   You are doing the deeds of your father."
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.420]   They said to him, "We were not born of fornication.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.260]   We have one father, God."
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.820]   Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.520]   For I proceeded forth and have come from God.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.940]   For I've not even come on my own initiative, but he sent me.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.620]   Why do you not understand what I'm saying?
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.000]   It is because you cannot hear my word.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.920]   You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.780]   He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.220]   truth in him.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.400]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.800]   For he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.700]   But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.540]   Which one of you convicts me of sin?
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.280]   If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.640]   He who is of God hears the words of God.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.040]   For this reason, you do not hear them because you are not of God."
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   Period.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.480]   Take a moment to pause right there.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.840]   You know, there are times when you share the gospel, you're going to have to convince people
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.440]   of many things of the gospel truths.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.520]   You're going to sometimes have to just simply convince them, "No, no, no.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.600]   There exists such a being as God who is powerful."
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   Right?
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   "No, no, no.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.880]   There exists such a thing as heaven."
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.000]   One of the hardest things to do is convince them this, "No, no, no.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.320]   There is no righteousness in you.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.520]   You are not of God.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.960]   He is not always on your side.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.920]   You are not good.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.080]   You cannot claim any righteousness.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.960]   This part of it is not just some kind of angry rant.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.760]   Yes, there is this clear indication.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.680]   Jesus is like, 'Why don't you get it?'
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.640]   But this is Jesus preaching the gospel because he is giving them truth.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.920]   And he says it, "I'm giving you truth of God.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   You are not with the Lord.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.320]   You are not of the Lord."
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.120]   Now, you don't have to say it in this way, but Jesus makes it explicitly clear, "Your
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.720]   father is the devil."
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   Right?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.320]   I actually recommend, please don't do that when you're sharing.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.600]   You know, like, "You're daddy."
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.320]   You don't have to do that, right?
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   But this much is very clear.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.280]   You are not of God.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   He's not with you.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.480]   Do not be presumptuous.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.960]   Let's follow on a little bit.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.480]   The Jews answered and said to him, "Do we not say rightly that you are a Samaritan and
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   have a demon?"
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.960]   Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my father and you dishonor me.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.600]   But I do not seek my glory.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.240]   There is one who seeks and judges.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.200]   Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my words, he will never see death."
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.480]   And the Jew said to him, "Now we know you have a demon.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.280]   Abraham died and the prophets also.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   And you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'"
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.920]   It's so silly how the Jews respond.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.600]   They're like a child.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.880]   Jesus says, "Your father is the devil."
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.400]   And pretty much they're like, "No, you."
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   Right?
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   Because that's what they're doing.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   It's like, "No, you.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   What about you?"
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   Right?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   When they say, "You're a demon."
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.520]   And what's really interesting though is there is this strange moment of so close and yet
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   so far.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:23.040]   They hear what Jesus is saying and naturally their mind goes to, "Wait a minute.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.480]   Who are you trying to say you are?"
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   Take a look.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   Verse 53, "Surely you are not greater than Abraham, our father, who died.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.000]   The prophets died too.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.440]   Whom do you make yourself to be?"
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.800]   That is such an important question.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.560]   To what we're talking about today, this is such an important question.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.480]   And Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.440]   It is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say he is our God.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.160]   And you have not come to know him, but I know him.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.480]   If I say that I do not know him, I will be a liar like you.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.180]   But I do know him and keep his word.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:04.400]   Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad."
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.120]   The Jews said, "What?
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.920]   You're not yet 50 years old and have you seen Abraham?"
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:18.560]   And Jesus said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am."
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.600]   What is he saying?
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.320]   Those are some crazy words.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.480]   And so the Jews respond in a natural humanistic way.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.040]   Therefore, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.080]   The mid-corollary of this, meaning I know that maybe this was a long passage kind of
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.880]   thinking through like, how does this relate to us now?
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.640]   You don't know how many times I sat down with somebody who's grown up in the church and
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.440]   I asked them, "Can you tell me about your relationship with Jesus?"
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.240]   Right now, this point number two is talking about reconciliation.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:40:01.000]   And the whole question really is, it begs the question, what's your relationship status?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.960]   Is it in a relationship, married, whatever it may be?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.040]   Are you confused?
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   What's going on?
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.520]   The question is, what's your relationship status?
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.200]   I don't know how many times I've sat down with somebody and just said, "Oh, you know
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   what?
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.920]   I've always been Christian."
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   And I go, "Oh, you know what?"
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   I'm like, "Okay, the answer is no, okay?
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.800]   You're not always a Christian."
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.760]   Sometimes people will say, "You know, I knew God was always with me."
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.040]   I'm sorry to say, He was not always with you, right?
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.600]   I always believed in God, ever since I was young.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   Did you always believe in God?
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.520]   Because scripture says we're born in ignorance.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:47.320]   We're literally born as mute, deaf, and blind people who can't see God.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:53.560]   God has made it so by His nature because He's so holy, you can't see Him, otherwise you
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.400]   die.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   The whole history of the nation of Israel was a case example how you can only come a
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.180]   certain distance because to see His glory would mean your death.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.240]   But here you are saying, "Since I was a baby, you always saw Him?"
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.000]   I'm sorry, I think you're wrong.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.320]   Do you see the presumption?
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.680]   Now here's my question to you because not only that, but when I ask this question, "What
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.000]   is your relationship status?"
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.300]   I get all sorts of different kind of answers sometimes.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.260]   There are people who are like, "Yeah, it's complicated.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.120]   My relationship status is complicated."
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.400]   There was a part where I was all excited that I was in this relationship and then I got
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.040]   distracted, I fell away for a while, I took it a little seriously, and then I came back,
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:42.720]   and the next thing you know, I got apathetic again, and then now it's kind of like a girlfriend
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.480]   and boyfriend who was off and on and off and on and off and on.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   It's complicated.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   You know how it is.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:54.820]   And I'm standing there like, "You see, it's hard to talk to you about that because I don't
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.060]   think you get the point.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:04.020]   Jesus is Lord, and to think you can do an off and on, off and on, and off and on with
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.220]   Him, I don't think you understand Him.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.180]   Does that make sense to you?"
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   Right?
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:18.800]   To presume that you can do that with the Lord means you don't understand Him.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.440]   Because if you set these terms, if you set this timeline, you set these parameters of
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.080]   when you're ready, then you'll be serious, but when you're not, you won't.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.480]   And then when you feel like it's good for you, then you will.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.940]   I'm not ready for this yet.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   So then, of course, God, you'll understand, right?
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.120]   I don't think you get it.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.720]   And so that's why we're talking about today, the Lordship matters, understanding Him matters,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.080]   and that reconciliation must matter.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.440]   I've literally asked people, "What's your relationship right now?"
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.120]   Sometimes they've almost talked to me like, "You know, this reconciliation is like two
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.200]   parties who are at fault.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.600]   God needs to kind of repent, basically, for the kind of horrible life He gave you, the
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.560]   hardships, lack of parental care, lack of friends, whatever it may be, various difficulties,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.440]   physical ailments, and then you forgive Him, and then He forgives you, and then you make
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   peace."
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:17.200]   That is not the kind of reconciliation the Bible describes, right?
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:26.920]   We are in a moment of impending doom by the wrath of God Almighty, and this has to be
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.560]   reconciled.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:35.440]   If you are not sure whether you have been reconciled with God, and you are ready to
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.760]   sign the membership covenant, don't sign it yet.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.640]   That has to be cleared with God.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:49.000]   And if you think you can just keep going anyway, I don't think you understand who He is.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.320]   That's my point.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.400]   There must be a reconciliation.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:58.640]   And therefore, that is why the Scripture says that we must confess Him, that we must confess
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.800]   with our mouth, believe in our hearts that Christ is Lord.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.000]   I'm going to move to a point three, which is then this is our corporate confession.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.560]   This is our corporate experience.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.220]   This is what binds us together.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.720]   This is who we are by identity as a community, and nothing else.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.520]   This is what matters.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.760]   We are held together by the confession that He is Christ, that He is Lord, and that He,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.160]   Jesus the Lord, is the one who saves.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.600]   And the reason why you and I have the greatest affinity, the greatest sense of, "Wow, you
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.840]   and I are like the same," is because we've reconciled with the Lord.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.800]   There's a passage, just listen to this, Ephesians 4, 4-6 that says, "There is one body, one
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.960]   spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith,
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:52.760]   one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.360]   That's it.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.200]   There is our bond.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.840]   As brothers and sisters in Christ, that's it.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.800]   Everything else peripheral.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.360]   Everything else secondary.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   This is the core thing.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.040]   And just like we read right at the beginning, Peter read this passage.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.480]   I want us to read it together.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.920]   Acts 10, verse 34.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.280]   Opening his mouth, Peter said, "I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.840]   partiality, but in every nation, the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   to Him.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:29.220]   The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching priests through Jesus Christ, He
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.040]   is Lord of all."
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.680]   What Peter is doing, he's looking at the landscape of the gospel ministry.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.520]   He's thinking past and realizes God has been teaching the gospel to the nation of Israel,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.720]   and now it's going forth to the nations, and what I see is God making peace.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.480]   In the conclusion, he says, "Jesus is Lord of all."
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   Jesus is Lord of all.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.400]   This is the amazing truth.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.480]   And I want to make mention of this because when we think about this corporate confession,
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.120]   this is so vital to the health of the church.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.760]   I mentioned at the introduction, we have a vision.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   We have a commitment.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:14.520]   None of those things can be accomplished unless we have a clarity about who is a genuine disciple
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.300]   of Jesus.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.000]   It has been an incredible detriment and a disservice to the church when there has been
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   this trend.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.800]   Let's make the door to the church as wide as possible so that non-Christians can feel
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.880]   comfortable here.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.840]   That was an immense disservice to the church.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.620]   Maybe well-intended, maybe it was a good desire to serve the people who are not Christians,
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.480]   but it was horrible for the church.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   Why?
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.160]   What we are doing here right now, we're just sitting next to each other.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:48.680]   By faith, I believe this is not a business, this is not a social exercise.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.440]   Let's see how they can do if you put them together.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.040]   This is not any kind of academic endeavor where I'm just teaching you and you are gaining
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.480]   knowledge.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.000]   This right now, even though by my human eyes, it's just a bunch of people sitting together,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.960]   this is a spiritual exercise of giving God worship, amen?
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.460]   Not possible if we're confused about who is in Christ.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:18.760]   When we think about building this community after the character of Jesus' love, not possible
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.400]   if we do not have the Lordship of Christ reigning in our hearts.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.320]   When we desire for you to witness and to be this invisible yet visible, shining, glorious
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:34.960]   light of the Lord Jesus, that is a spiritual activity that has to be empowered by the Lord.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.200]   Not possible if we are confused.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.740]   How can I expect you to do that when you're not sure about your standing with the Lord?
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:49.560]   If we muddy the lines of who is a Christian and who is not, we will ruin the church.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.160]   And that is why this is of such high importance.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.640]   And what's more, remember, I want to reiterate again, we're not doing this just to make Berean
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.080]   great.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.480]   We don't say all this kind of stuff to be like, "Yeah, we want to be elite Bereans who
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.240]   are like soldiers ready to take over the world."
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.520]   Okay?
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.520]   None of the leaders think like that.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.680]   Our hearts beat and like passion is like the apostles when they say, "The greatest treasure
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:26.380]   to you is to know you are a son and daughter of God."
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.640]   And so 1 John, he says, "I write to you.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.180]   I write to you these things so that you might know."
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:38.680]   We want you to hold fast and know that there is a possibility of an assurance of salvation.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:45.200]   That if you know the truth of God, that if you know that He is Lord and you confess it
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.780]   and you believe in your heart and because you know that because He is Lord, He is truly
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.860]   the only way, He is the truth and He is the life, and therefore I have entrusted my life
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.900]   to Him, you can be assured.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.080]   You could have the peace of the Lord.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.820]   That is to you the greatest privilege.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.900]   And it would be a sad, sad tragedy if you were confused.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.800]   And so we walked through a bunch, right?
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.460]   We walked through Jesus being Lord and walked through the passage.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:19.380]   We saw that there needs to be reconciliation and we saw that the Jewish Pharisees of the
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.880]   time, they couldn't do that reconciliation because they presumed a lot.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.220]   They presumed that they were more righteous than they were and they presumed that God
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.700]   was obligated to accept them.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:35.420]   We're learning also then that this kind of mentality and confession has to be the core
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.060]   of our church together.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.180]   The last part I want to talk about then is this.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:47.420]   There is this assurance that you are supposed to exercise that is going to be the heartbeat
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.660]   of our church.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:57.620]   What you do is predicated by your belief that Jesus is Lord, right?
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:03.380]   We do not want you just to do the red tape, jump through the hoops, and just do the things
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.400]   we tell you to do.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.780]   We are so thankful because, especially as I think about it, as a pastor, I'm so grateful.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:16.100]   I'm just a young man, but the church gives a lot of weight and respect to the leaders
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:20.220]   here and you guys pretty much try and do what we try to instruct.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.660]   That's like an amazing thing.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.380]   But as I think about that, I'm wary.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.900]   I don't want you to just do the things we say because I said it.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.940]   We want you to operate by the full assurance Christ is my Lord, Christ is my Savior, and
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:42.300]   therefore, whether any human leader is there or not, you have a sustaining, you have a
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.860]   steady devotion to the Lord.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.540]   Now for the sake of time, I'm going to quickly move to a kind of conclusion and wrap things
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.220]   all up, okay?
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.460]   In this whole debate and thought about the controversy of Lordship Salvation, there have
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:02.260]   been people who've asked this question.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.960]   And I've actually pre-started Lordship Salvation in many other contexts and I've had people
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.060]   come to me and say, "Dude, I get it.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.420]   The Bible says Jesus is Lord.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.340]   I'm not going to deny that because it says that.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.740]   That's good and great."
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:21.820]   But it still, for me, feels like it goes against the concept that your salvation is a simple
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.820]   gift.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.100]   Don't we call it grace?
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.100]   Doesn't that mean gift?
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.940]   And so they say, just kind of like any gift, like if someone gives you this gift, then
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.820]   you receive it.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:39.180]   So why are you doubting people's salvation based on their Lordships and submission and
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.380]   are they bearing fruit and are they professing to, are they committed to forsake sin and
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.140]   all that kind of stuff?
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.340]   Doesn't that seem legalistic?
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.940]   Doesn't that seem like you say you don't want elite Koreans, but that's what it sounds like
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.940]   to me.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.820]   Because for them, they're thinking it's a simple gift.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.820]   And so if you receive it, it doesn't matter if you're having your ups and downs through
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:04.580]   life, you shouldn't be doubting whether you receive this or not.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.700]   Why are you doubting that?
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:13.580]   Now again, remember I said when we focus on the mechanics of how do you receive this gift,
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.700]   I am not debating with you.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.780]   I am affirming the scriptural truth.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.820]   You receive this gift simply by faith.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:27.780]   Lord you're gracious, you give this to me so I receive it with really, really appreciative
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.220]   and grateful and broken hands.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.180]   That much is true.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.180]   So I'm not actually arguing with you.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.940]   So what am I arguing?
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:42.900]   The question is, do you have any idea what gift you received?
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.260]   If you think this gift, I mean I want you to think about the greatest and biggest gift
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.220]   you've ever received.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.740]   Maybe to you it was like a new cell phone.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.100]   It's like, "Oh, the iPhone!"
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.420]   Maybe it was something bigger.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.180]   Maybe you received like a home, like a condo.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.540]   A lot of people, they get married, their parents are like, "I want you to have a great start."
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.540]   So they buy them a condo.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.420]   You're like, "Oh my goodness, a condo?
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.740]   That's crazy."
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.060]   And so you receive it with great earnestness.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.740]   And so yeah, the analogy makes sense.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.540]   How would you even doubt whether you have it or not?
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:20.500]   Because our theology says the chasm between a house, a car, and receiving the Lord as
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:25.560]   your gift is so, so great and grand.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.380]   If you're sitting there having this option of, "You know, I'm just going to neglect them
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   for a while.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   You know, I have other priorities.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.220]   You know, I'm not even sure."
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:38.020]   If you do not understand the gift you receive and you cannot articulate that you as a sinner
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:44.220]   has received the Lord, then I'm not sure I can say you had any idea what you were doing
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.580]   when you received it.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:54.340]   To say that you can receive this gift and yet not transform you, I don't think you were
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.020]   fully aware of what you were doing.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:03.380]   To say you received this person, the Lord God, the one who is eternal, the creator of
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.860]   all things, the sustainer of life, and yet have no effect in your life, I don't think
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.580]   you get the point.
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.620]   It's not so much about the mechanics.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:20.480]   The more so is actually just simply focused on who it is you have received.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.780]   And so again, that's why we say the scriptures tell us that what God is doing in our lives
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:35.900]   is not so much giving you just simple things like freedoms, powers, energies, and gifts.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.460]   For us as Christians, it's God in you, with you.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:45.300]   And he's going to do such a work where confidence says he will carry it through to the end.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.740]   And we dare not diminish that by saying, "You know what?
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.380]   I can only go so far."
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.500]   Let's make sure that we understand in all of this who it is that we say we confess is
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.740]   our Lord and Savior.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   Let's pray.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:11.860]   Lord, we know that God, we're going to be learning for the rest of our lives what it
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.660]   means to have you as our Lord.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:22.940]   We also confess, God, that because we are like children, learning in progressive manner,
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.620]   there's a lot we don't know yet.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:32.220]   And God, we confess that, we acknowledge that, but yet, Lord, we pray for more.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:39.500]   I pray that we will grow to understand both in truth and experience what it means to have
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:46.820]   this amazing privilege to have the righteous King of all be our King, to have the most
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:52.140]   humble, gracious, and loving King of all be our King.
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.780]   We know that this is a unique privilege that we didn't even think of, draft of ourselves.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.560]   We didn't ask for it, but you have presented it to us.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:06.180]   And so, God, we recognize this is a unique, unique privilege, and we thank you.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.180]   I pray that this truth would affect us so deeply.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.140]   I pray we would never take it for granted.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:16.720]   I pray that we would never diminish it or just simply assume it's ours because I happen
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.820]   to be at church.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:24.140]   I ask, Lord, that we would dig deep into what these things mean and so that, Lord, our life
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:31.300]   at church here would genuinely be by faith and an understanding of this, this person,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.220]   Jesus Christ, He is my Lord.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:41.060]   I again pray also, Lord, that if there is anybody in this room who feels unsure, if
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:45.620]   there's anybody in this room, Father God, who does not know where they stand with Christ,
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.760]   would you grant to them that humility, would you grant to them that urgency to clear the
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   air with you to make sure, Father God, that they are seeking your acceptance, that make
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.860]   sure that they are seeing that, Father Lord, acceptance is possible in the precious name
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.380]   of Jesus.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.920]   And so I pray, Father God, that there would be such a confidence in the Lord, such an
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.260]   assurance of your great saving power.
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.260]   We thank you, Lord.
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.260]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
