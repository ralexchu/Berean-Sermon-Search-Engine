[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Why can't we love pleasure and love God at the same time?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.760]   Paul seems to assume that we can't, and it's a text that confuses a podcast listener
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.240]   named Gabriel, who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.780]   My question is about that phrase in 2 Timothy 3:4, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.160]   of God."
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.840]   Has this established a dichotomy between seeking pleasure and seeking God?
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.700]   If so, why is it impossible to do both?
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.100]   Why can't we love pleasure and love God at the same time?
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680]   Pastor John, what would you say to Gabriel?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.000]   It is about time that we get this question.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.020]   I mean, we are Christian hedonists, and there's a text just crying out for attention.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.080]   So let's put the text in front of us.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.920]   Here's what he says, 2 Timothy 3, 1-5, "In the last days there will come times of difficulty.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.920]   For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.720]   to parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760]   brutal, not loving, good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit."
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   And here it comes, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.560]   of godliness but denying the power, avoid such people."
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.600]   Now Gabriel is certainly right to flag this text as something that needs special attention,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.880]   especially from a Christian hedonist like me.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.640]   Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.760]   Is this then not an indictment of Christian hedonism, which says we should pursue our
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.840]   fullest and lasting pleasure in God no matter what it costs?
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   That's what I believe and have devoted my life to arguing for and trying to live.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.320]   Gabriel wants to know, can't we pursue pleasure and God?
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.200]   Can't we love pleasure and God at the same time, which Paul seems to say, "No, you
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   can't."
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.840]   So what we have to do with a text like this is not turn away from the text and start making
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.320]   up our own views about pleasure and about God, but stay with the text and let Paul tell
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.480]   us how he's using his words, namely the word "pleasure" and the word "God" in
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   particular.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.560]   Paul is clearly treating them as competitors for our affections, for our love.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.360]   Loving pleasure rather than loving God.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.520]   He's treating God as an object of our love, and he's treating pleasure as an object
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   of our love.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.440]   And when you think of them that way, pleasure is clearly being perceived as an idol, an
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.560]   alternative to loving God.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160]   That's the way Paul is setting it up.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.680]   Paul is not asking the question whether, looked at another way, God might be our pleasure.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   He's not asking that.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.440]   He's not talking about that.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.480]   If God is our pleasure, then pleasure can't be in competition with God, but pleasure is
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.660]   virtually the same as our love for God.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.580]   So Paul is using the word "pleasure" as an object of delight, not an act of delight.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580]   Mark that.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.460]   That's so important to get our categories clear.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.660]   He's treating the word "pleasure," he's treating the reality of pleasure as an object
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.380]   of our delighting, not the act of our delighting.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.540]   If pleasure is an object of delight, something we delight in, then it competes with God,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.820]   and we have to choose God above pleasure.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.480]   But if pleasure is viewed not as the object of delight, but the act of delighting, then
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.700]   God can be the object of that delighting.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420]   He can be our delight, be our pleasure.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.560]   And in that sense, pleasure and God would not be in competition at all.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.900]   But that's not the way Paul is thinking here.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.980]   Paul is thinking here of pleasure as a physical or psychological sensation that we crave more
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.380]   than we crave God.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.440]   And in this sense, pleasure has to become an idol, and we must choose between pleasure
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.740]   and God.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.820]   So let me tell two stories that illustrate what I think Paul is getting at.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.540]   I remember—here's the first story—I remember over 20 years ago interviewing Sam Crabtree
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.300]   as an executive pastor candidate for Bethlehem, and he's been at Bethlehem ever since.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.100]   In the interview, he said something that made me love and admire him and his insight.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   We hired him.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.100]   I love Sam.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600]   He's still wise.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.220]   He said that he worries about some churches, which in their worship services seem to be
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.060]   "loving, loving God more than loving God."
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.260]   Let me say it again, because it struck me, and that's why I remembered all these years
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:56.420]   later, he was concerned that in some worship services, people seem to be "loving, loving
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.500]   God more than loving God."
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:07.100]   So a person might say he's taking pleasure in God in worship, and that would be good,
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.960]   but he might slip over into taking more pleasure in the pleasure of taking pleasure in God
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.380]   than in really taking pleasure in God.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.300]   And we all know this danger, right?
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.180]   We can slip into loving the emotional music, or slip into the emotional fellowship, or
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.140]   slip into the various physical and psychological sensations that attend a focus with God, while
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.660]   God himself slowly disappears.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.540]   The beauty of his character and the beauty of his ways just drop out of our consciousness.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.260]   That would be a religious form of the kind of thing Paul is concerned about here, loving
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260]   pleasure rather than loving God.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.140]   Now here's the second story.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.100]   It's an even more pointed illustration, I think.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.740]   Soon after Noelle and I were married, I read a book about sex in marriage, and it made
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.420]   this amazing statement that I had not thought of before, but ever since have considered
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.140]   it to stock beautiful, glorious, obvious wisdom.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:26.300]   It said, "One kiss after sexual climax is worth a thousand kisses before sexual climax."
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   Whoa!
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.420]   Now, why would that be?
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.820]   It's because all the kisses of foreplay are ambiguous.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:46.980]   They might be owing to strong affections for your spouse as a cherished person, or you
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:55.020]   might have gotten so caught up in the love of pleasure, the sensations, that the kisses
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:02.060]   have no connection with the preciousness of the person and are only expressions of sexual
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.300]   abandon and sexual sensation.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:14.460]   But after sexual climax, when there are no overpowering physical sensations carrying
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:27.220]   you, but only the preciousness of the relationship, then a tender eye-to-eye heartfelt kiss says,
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.900]   "You are more precious to me than all those sensations."
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.620]   And if I had to choose, I would choose you.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.220]   You, you, Noelle.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.340]   Not mainly the sexual sensations that you give me, but you are my cherished treasure.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:54.740]   Now, that is, I think, what Paul is getting at in relation to God.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:02.020]   Remember, it says—this is amazing—it says in verse 5 of 2 Timothy 3 that these people
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:10.700]   have an appearance of godliness while they are loving pleasure more than loving God.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.100]   But in fact, they are being sustained not by the power of godliness, not by the power
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:23.940]   of the beauty of God's person and the preciousness of his fellowship; they're being sustained
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.700]   by the secondary pleasures of being part of the Christian community.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:36.740]   So the answer to Gabriel's question is, you can't love pleasure and love God when
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:46.380]   pleasure is conceived as an alternative object of your affections luring you away from a
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.820]   superior delight in God.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:59.940]   But you can pursue pleasure and pursue God at the same time if God himself is your pleasure.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.100]   Amen.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.580]   That is a good, clarifying word on this text.
