[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11, I'll be reading from verse 8
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680]   through 16.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.280]   I'm going to jump back into the text that I started a few weeks ago.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.280]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 8 through 16.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.440]   And I'll be reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.840]   By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.200]   for an inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.120]   By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.120]   in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of same promise.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.960]   For he was looking for the city which has foundation, whose architect and builder is
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   God.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.840]   By faith even Sarah herself received the ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.900]   life, since she considered him faithful who had promise.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.440]   Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead, as many descendants
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.320]   as the stars of heaven in number, and in New Brumble as the sand which is by the seashore.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.520]   All these died in faith without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.960]   welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers in exiles
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.200]   on the earth.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.760]   For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.320]   And indeed if they had been thinking of this country from which they went out, they would
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.840]   have had opportunity to return.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.540]   But as it is, they desire a better country that is a heavenly one.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.320]   Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   them.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   Let's pray.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   Christian loving Father, we ask that you would help us during this time to not only
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   to hear your word, but that you would illuminate us that we may understand and apply it in
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.620]   our hearts.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.160]   Help us to be sanctified.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   Help us Lord God to truly love you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.800]   That we would not worship you out of habit, but we would render our hearts and not just
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   our garments.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.440]   So we pray that you would anoint this time for your namesake.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   Amen.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560]   All right, so we're at part two of the section that we're looking at, and in the larger section
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.120]   of talking about the heroes of faith.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.260]   And so as we talked about before, just as a refresher, that chapter 11 is a transitional
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.560]   chapter starting from chapter 1 through 10, talking about the supremacy of Christ and
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   how we ought to live by faith.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.820]   And what does that mean?
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.780]   To bear fruit in faith.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.100]   And then we get to chapter 12.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.480]   Therefore, concerning all that crisis on who he is, that we ought to continue to live our
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.700]   lives in obedience.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   So chapter 11 is that transition where he says, "Obedience comes by faith."
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   Right?
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   It's not one or the other.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.240]   It's not, "We believe so, it doesn't matter."
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.440]   Or "We're going to work hard and achieve."
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.200]   But he says, "No, obedience ultimately comes by faith."
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   And that's a theme of every single person that is mentioned here.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.400]   And in particular, the life of Abraham.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.120]   Abraham is considered the father of faith.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.960]   So every single person here in the book of Genesis, he says, "If they have become righteous,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.100]   Abraham, what God declared of him, he is righteous because of his faith."
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.620]   And so last week we talked about his calling as he's one of the greatest examples of what
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.160]   it means to live by faith.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.660]   God called him out, it says in verse 8, "By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.520]   by going out."
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   And that was the first calling of every Christian.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.820]   You cannot follow Christ while maintaining a continued and same relationship that you
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.820]   had with the world before you met Christ.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.020]   Because the very first step of meeting Christ is repenting from the life that we lived before
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.140]   we met Christ.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.300]   We don't add Christ to the life that we live.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   We're pursuing the same things, love the same things, value the same things, and then we
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.740]   just happen to add Christ on Sundays.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.900]   Well, we didn't go to church and now we're going to church.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.420]   But nothing of our pursuit, nothing of our value has changed.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.540]   Hebrews chapter 13, 11, as Christ was crucified outside the camp, he calls every Christian
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.860]   to go outside the camp.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.820]   So again, our justification happens when we recognize that not just an act and not just
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.860]   something that we did, but our totality of our life was in rebellion against God.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.280]   And so we repent and we turn and we begin to walk toward Christ.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.500]   That's what repentance means.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.660]   And so we talked about that last week, how Abraham, in order for him to live by promise
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.980]   to receive his inheritance, he first had to leave his home.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.700]   The second part we want to get to is also in this verse where it says, "They obeyed
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.800]   by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and he went out not knowing
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.460]   where he was going.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.720]   By faith he lives as an alien in the land of promise.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.020]   As in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.420]   promise."
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.860]   Not only did he leave his home, the Bible says that living by faith means to live as
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.440]   aliens and strangers during this life.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.080]   The theologians call that here and not yet.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.980]   Every single Christian who's been called out of this world, we have not gotten home yet.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.980]   We're wandering.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.960]   I think the best illustration of what our Christian life is like is like the Israelites
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   who are wandering in the desert for 40 years.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.580]   God delivers them from slavery.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.080]   So even though they're wandering as free and became a nation, they haven't entered into
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   the promised land yet.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.640]   They see it, but they're wandering.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.420]   Every single Christian who's been called out of this world, we live in a period of sanctification.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.100]   We have not been to glory yet.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.120]   We've seen a glimpse of it, but we're kind of wandering in the desert.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.880]   Again, that's why the theologians call this period here and not yet.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.040]   We've seen a glimpse of his glory.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.780]   We have an idea through the church what his kingdom looks like, but the actual complete
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.640]   deliverance is described when he comes in his glory, we will be also glorified with
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   him.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.480]   So the life of Abraham is an example of what our Christian life ought to look like.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.040]   So first thing, again, that we said, which God calls him out of his comfort zone, and
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.640]   then he doesn't enter into his new house.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.760]   He doesn't come out and say, "Well, he didn't make a trade-off between his hometown of Uruqqalidin,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.200]   and then he wandered and then packed his stuff and moved into the land of Canaan and then
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700]   started building his house."
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.480]   The Bible says that he lived the rest of the life that he lived as aliens and strangers
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   in the land.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.760]   He never entered the promised land.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.360]   That's exactly how our life is described in 1 Peter 2.11.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.560]   He says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.640]   wage war against your soul."
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.800]   Peter writes that in 1 Peter because the persecution was ramping up.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.960]   I mean, they were always persecuted before that period, but 1 Peter is written around
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.400]   60 to 65 AD, and that's when Nero started doing his crazy stuff where you see movies
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.520]   where you have Christians being dragged into the Colosseum, torn apart by lions, and they're
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.040]   all being crucified, burned.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.080]   I mean, crazy things were happening.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.680]   This was written right as that was beginning to happen, and so they were beginning to feel
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.320]   this pressure that some of them not only were having a hard time having their jobs, taking
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.200]   care of their children, but literally being torn apart by animals.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   Peter doesn't say, "Hey, trust in God.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.840]   If you trust in God and if you're faithful, he's going to show up and deliver you.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.560]   He's going to punish these pagans."
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.600]   He never makes that promise.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.840]   He doesn't tell them that they're not going to die.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.160]   He doesn't tell them that the life is going to be easy.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:04.400]   He reminds them, "If you feel like you don't fit in this world, it's because you don't."
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.160]   And he actually reminds them, "If the world rejects you and they're constantly telling
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.000]   you we don't want you among us, and some of them may simply not like you, some of them
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.400]   may persecute you, and some of them may actually try to kill you.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.320]   When you face that, remember, you are an alien and stranger in this world."
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.040]   In fact, this is not the words of Peter.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   Peter was taught that by Jesus himself.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.320]   "When I send you out and they don't know you, it's because they don't know me.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.840]   They hate you, it's because they hated me.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.280]   They crucified me, so they're going to try to crucify you."
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.400]   And he warned them, "If you want to keep following me, you pick up your cross, deny yourself
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.200]   as well, and follow me."
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   And it was actually happening.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.760]   Quite like Jesus said.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.640]   And so Peter is repeating the words that he heard from his Savior, that you are an alien
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   and stranger.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.360]   Don't try so hard to fit in here because you don't fit in.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.400]   As long as you are a child of God, you will always be an alien and stranger while you're
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   on this earth.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.240]   You know what's really interesting is that those two words, aliens and stranger, in the
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.520]   Greek alien means para oikos.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.480]   You probably heard the term oikos before, right?
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   What's the meaning of the word oikos?
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.000]   Home, right?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.120]   House or home.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.240]   So para oikos, para basically means to be alongside.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.040]   That that's not your home, you're alongside the home.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.800]   That's what an alien means, that you don't really have your home.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   It's kind of like living in a rented house.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.720]   You live there and you have a place to stay, but that's not your home.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.640]   That's what the word alien means, right?
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.320]   It doesn't mean that you're not living, you're there, but it's not your permanent home.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.400]   The word for stranger is para pidmas.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.180]   Para basically is the same word para alongside pidmas is the word for people.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.960]   So the word stranger means you are along with the people, but you don't really belong.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.240]   It's like somebody who kind of immigrated to another country and you don't speak the
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.080]   language, you don't speak the culture.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.600]   You come from another land, but you immigrated and you're staying there for a period.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   That's the word that is being used here, para oikos, para pidmas.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.800]   That you're living among the people, but you don't belong there.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.200]   You have a place to stay, but that's not your house.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:29.280]   And he is reminding them that when the world reminds you that you are an alien and stranger
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:36.400]   and they treat you like you don't belong here, he reminds them it's because you do not.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.060]   But you know, it's easy to say here, but at the core of every single person in this room,
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.560]   there is a longing to belong.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   There's a longing to belong.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.760]   There's not a single person here that doesn't say, "I don't care where I belong."
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   No, everybody wants to belong because God created us that way.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.320]   When God created Adam, he said it wasn't good for him to be alone.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.560]   And he created Eve as a companion.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.080]   And so at the core of who we are, every single one of us want to belong.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.780]   And when people rebel, they rebel together.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.000]   You rarely see people rebelling by themselves.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.440]   Even the anarchists have to check with the other anarchists how they are going to be
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.560]   anarchists together, because they belong in that group.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.040]   Now I realize that even at church, you know, I realize all these years of seeing people
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.800]   come and go at the church, people will come to church because, not the only reason, but
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.120]   people will come to church and look for a church where they'll hear the sermon or they'll
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.440]   see the service or they like the worship and say, "I want to come visit that church."
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.640]   And so it'll bring people to the church, but usually people will not stay until they feel
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   like they belong.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   Okay, and I'm not talking about 100%.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.960]   We're talking about just generally speaking.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.780]   I found that through the years, right, the Sunday worship will attract people, but what
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.800]   causes people to stay is if they feel like they belong.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.360]   See that desire to belong is innately in us.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.120]   In fact, you guys may remember, some of you, in fact, first service, I don't think I had
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.880]   anybody know, but remember the sitcom Cheers?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.680]   Okay, I'm going to look in this direction to make sure I'm making connection, right?
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.560]   So Cheers was a sitcom back in the '80s and it was basically kind of like The Office,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   right?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.040]   The Office, I forgot when that was.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.800]   The whole sitcom was based upon what was happening at The Office.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.000]   Well, Cheers was a sitcom where everything was happening at this bar called The Cheers.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.600]   And it was just a bunch of friends that would get together and just talk nonsense.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   There was no purpose.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.080]   It was just them hanging out, just goofing around.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.960]   But it was the hottest sitcom at that time.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.080]   And this is their opening song.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.160]   Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.880]   Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.360]   Wouldn't you like to get away?
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.680]   Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.040]   You want to be where you can see our troubles are all the same.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.000]   You want to be where everybody knows your name.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.600]   Now, this is about the sitcom, about this bar that people are hanging out with, but
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.520]   I think that resonates with every single one of us.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.240]   You can say it's almost Christian, right?
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.160]   But this is not unique to Christian.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   This is every single human being wants to go where they feel like they belong.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.800]   They care that you came.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.280]   They care that you didn't come.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.240]   Remember the next big sitcom that came around, Friends, right?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.040]   This is just a bunch of friends hanging around and no specific purpose.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.400]   It's just their interaction and what their life was like.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.320]   And this is their lyrics.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.760]   So no one told you life was going to be this way.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   Your job's a joke.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   You're broke.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.880]   Your love, life's DOA.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.840]   It's like you're always stuck in second gear when it hasn't been your day, your week, your
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.760]   month, or even your year.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   But I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.080]   I'll be there for you like I've been there before.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.960]   I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.560]   You're still in bed at 10 and work began at 8.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.680]   You burned your breakfast.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.600]   So far, things are going great.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.400]   Your mother warned you there'd be days like these, but she didn't tell you when the world
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.640]   has brought you down to your knees that I'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.520]   I'll be there for you like I've been there before.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.120]   I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.440]   I'll bet you if you, you know, those of you who are thinking that you may not have articulated
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.880]   this, but I'll bet you there's a longing in your heart that is expressed in these very
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:44.560]   words because that's how God created us to long to belong.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:52.240]   And that's why this desire to belong, if we see that we belong to Christ and that causes
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   us to run to him, then you're going to bear fruit.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   Our whole life is a journey to get to Christ and belong in Christ and constantly be reminded
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   that that's where we're headed.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.080]   We're headed home.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.640]   We're headed where we belong.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.320]   But along with that temptation, that desire causes us to compromise, to belong where we
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.360]   don't belong.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.100]   We say things that we shouldn't say.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.520]   We do things that we shouldn't do.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.400]   We believe things that we shouldn't believe all because we simply want to belong.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.200]   Sometimes we do that even in the church.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.640]   We want to belong so much that we compromise.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.480]   We do things, say things, jump through the hoops and not jump through the hoops all because
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.280]   we all want to belong.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.760]   See, the life that is lived by faith is a life that is constantly wandering because
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.160]   we're not home.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.520]   The trouble that you and I get into is that we want home to be here.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   And so we are looking for churches.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.880]   We're looking for neighborhoods.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.840]   We want, you know, even at work, just wanting to belong because that's constantly resonated
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.160]   in our heart and in our mind.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.880]   You know, the problem is that once you belong somewhere and you feel like, "Oh, I feel
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   like I belong.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   I feel like I found a home."
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.600]   You know what the next stage is after you feel like you belong somewhere?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   Competing.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.200]   You know, if you don't belong anywhere, you're not competing with anybody because you're
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.720]   not comparing with anybody.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.280]   But you long to belong somewhere.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.440]   But as soon as you feel like you belong, I'm part of it.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   They know me.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   I know them.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.520]   And then the next temptation is you start comparing.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.960]   Who am I here?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.680]   And then you start competing.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.240]   Just like all the other ambitions you had before you belong, and you start comparing
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   and competing.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.080]   And then the third thing that happens when you're comparing and you're competing, you
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:54.000]   start collecting in order to fulfill that desire in our hearts.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.580]   So although that essential desire to want to belong is something that God has created
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:07.800]   inside of us, just like the sexual impulses, in and of itself is not evil because God created
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   it.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.760]   God gave it to mankind in order to procreate.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.160]   But it became perverted because you start expressing it in every other way outside of
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.400]   Christ.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.000]   So that need to belong is God-given.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.840]   But when we start to seek for that in places where God hasn't given us, where we don't
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.480]   belong, is where we begin to compromise.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.640]   And we deceive ourselves that we think we're living in obedience when we're not.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.880]   See the first call of Abraham is to leave your home.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.660]   And then the second thing that he told him to do is walk by faith.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:46.780]   As aliens and strangers, Abraham, it says in verse 8, did not know where he was going.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.040]   He didn't jump from one home to another home.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.800]   He said the home is coming, but meanwhile, for a hundred years, he walked
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.280]   out without ever finding his home.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.440]   You know, whenever we study somebody like Abraham, you know, it could encourage us from
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   a distance.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.160]   You say, wow, that guy literally left everything.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.000]   He was willing to wander in the desert.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.400]   But when you take a closer look at Abraham's life, he's not much different than us, right?
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.080]   Right after he's called, promises made, he steps out in faith.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.440]   And then in Genesis chapter 12, verse 11, right after the promise is made, he's in the
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.320]   land of Egypt and he's concerned, you know, because his wife is so beautiful, he's concerned
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.280]   that this powerful nation is going to come, basically take her and then kill him.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.000]   So he said, well, tell her, tell them you're my sister.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   So he deceives them.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.360]   Pharaoh comes and takes her to make her his concubine.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.400]   God's anger is burned because God's blessing is upon this family and God supernaturally
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   delivers them.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.880]   And you would think he's learned his lesson in Genesis chapter 20, same thing happens,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   right?
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.360]   He's wandering and in danger and the king of Abimelech show up and he said, hey, you
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   know what?
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.600]   I lived last time, it worked last time.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.560]   Let's do it again, right?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.800]   Say you're my sister.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.400]   She was a fantastic wife because both times she agreed and she did it, right?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.240]   I can't imagine people doing that now, right?
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.440]   She did it, she did it, she followed and she went through the system and then God supernaturally
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.720]   delivers him.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:34.680]   And even though he compromised in order to save his own neck, I mean, this is the man
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.800]   of faith.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.760]   In fact, if you look closer, it says that of Sarah, right?
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:53.320]   Sarah basically did the same thing later on when God promises a child, you know, in Hebrews
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:20:00.000]   chapter 11 verse 11, it says, "Faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive."
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.040]   Do you remember Sarah?
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.640]   When God promised at her old age that she was going to have a child, Sarah's response
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.760]   wasn't, oh, you know, I've been waiting, now, you know, I believe you.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.480]   That wasn't the response.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.000]   She turned around like, ha, right?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.520]   She laughed in unbelief and God rebukes her.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.920]   And that's why God names the child Laughter, Isaac.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:31.660]   But here it says because of her faith, she received the ability to conceive.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.640]   So what happened?
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.440]   Both Abraham and Sarah, their trajectory of life was obedience.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.040]   They were out wandering as strangers and aliens.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.480]   And yet, even though they believed in the big picture of who God is, the means in which
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:57.200]   God was going to fulfill this, they had a hard time accepting, just like all of us.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   We sit here every single day, every single time we're here, we sing praises of his greatness,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.560]   his glory, the God of the universe.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.920]   He died for our sins.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.520]   He was willing to give his only begotten son, his most precious thing, so that rebellious
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.000]   sinners can have a relationship with him.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.760]   And then what it says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   be added unto you."
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   It's like, really?
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.400]   Really?
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.720]   Even though we profess the big picture of what we believe in the grand scheme of things,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.480]   like we believe God, but when the rubber meets the road, we have the same problem as Abraham
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.280]   and Sarah.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   Will you really do that?
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.400]   If I do this, what if my business doesn't do well?
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.480]   If I do this, what if I get rejected from my family?
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.840]   If I do this, will I be accepted?
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.760]   Will I be able to take care of my family?
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.080]   These were just normal people.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.320]   Sometimes we look at these men and women of faith, and they're so far ahead of us, they're
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.520]   to be admired from a distance, but not to be followed.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.320]   Sometimes we read the New Testament that way.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.920]   Apostle Paul, you know, "I've learned the secret of being content in every and all situations."
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.400]   Well, that's an apostle.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   We're not that.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.120]   Oh, that's an early church.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   They saw Jesus.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.720]   Oh, those are the reformers were specially gifted people, anointed by God.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.960]   But when you take a closer look at every one of these heroes, they were just normal people
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.360]   who believed in a great God.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.800]   And he calls us, and every single one of us is journeying through this desert, longing
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.720]   to be in the eternal promised land.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:47.520]   But while we are journeying, we will experience being rejected, danger, sometimes doubts,
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.200]   struggles, our own personal failures.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.840]   But in the midst of that, he constantly reminds us, there is something coming.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.600]   See, that's why the Bible describes the life of a Christian as somebody who walks by faith
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.280]   and not by sight.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.320]   Because somebody who is walking by sight, if God doesn't fulfill the promise immediately,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.760]   then he's not worth following.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.160]   You know, in Genesis chapter 12, 1 to 3, and I'm just going to read starting from verse
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.720]   2, or starting from verse 1, this is the promise that God made with Abraham.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.240]   "Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.720]   your father's house to the land which I will show you.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.400]   And so you shall be a blessing.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.440]   And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.280]   And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.640]   Look at three things that he promises to Abraham in his descent.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.240]   One is land, right?
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.400]   You're going to leave your land and I'm going to take you to another land.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.040]   It's going to be filled with milk and honey.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.720]   Did Abraham ever see this land during his life?
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.280]   He did not.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.480]   The only land that he ever possessed was a tiny little cave that he purchased in Canaan
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.540]   to bury his wife.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:16.400]   So even though he left everything to follow God because of the promise of land, he never
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.040]   experienced it.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.600]   For a hundred years he wandered around and never saw the land.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.800]   And then he says, "I will make you a great nation."
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.160]   That your descendants are going to number the stars in the sand.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.760]   He made this promise when his wife was barren.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.280]   Did he ever see the nation come about?
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.480]   No.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.360]   He wandered around for a hundred years.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.700]   In fact, 400 years after he dies, all his descendants became slaves in Egypt.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.620]   So Abraham himself never saw this happen.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.280]   He promised him to be a blessing, that he was going to bless them and through them going
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.700]   to bless the rest of the world.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.880]   Did he ever see that?
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:06.320]   Did he ever see his nation, the nation, going to be multiplied and people going to be blessed
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   through them?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   Well, how could he?
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.240]   He was never formed during his life.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.680]   He lived all his life as a wanderer, as a nomad, as aliens and strangers.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.440]   He never stepped foot.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.480]   See, the Bible described for us why he was able to wander.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.760]   You would think that if God didn't fulfill the promise that he made, you know, after
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.480]   a year or two years, three, I can wait, right?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.680]   Because we can invest.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.320]   We all know what investment is like.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.920]   If you put your money in this mutual fund, you know, five years, six years, ten years,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.460]   if it doesn't mature and you don't make money off of it, you're going to pull it out.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.520]   But we're willing to sacrifice and not touch that money because we think the payoff is
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   coming.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.080]   But how long will you keep it in there if the payoff never comes?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   How many of you are going to put all that you have into an account that you can never
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:04.760]   touch, will never mature, you'll never see, and then just be done with it?
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.120]   You know what it says here in verse 13?
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   All these died in faith.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.000]   All these people who left and was wandering, they never saw the promised land.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.880]   They lived by faith, but they also died by faith without receiving the promises.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.720]   They never received it.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.320]   That is not during their lifetime.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   And having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance and having confessed that
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.840]   they were strangers and exiles on the earth, for those who say such things make it clear
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.080]   that they are seeking a country of their own.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.760]   They're continuing to go forward even though they didn't receive it, but look what it says
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   in verse 15.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.960]   And indeed, if they had been thinking of the country from which they had come from, they
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.160]   would have had the opportunity to return.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:57.960]   At some point in their journey, they realized the prize wasn't the physical Canaan.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.040]   Because if that's what they thought, they could have easily returned.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.160]   They would have pulled their money out and reinvested somewhere else.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.280]   Maybe put it back in the bank, at least put it in the CD where it's safe.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.780]   If that's what they wanted.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:16.980]   But at some point in their journey, they realized that Canaan wasn't the promised land.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:24.200]   That they were seeking a city where the foundation is laid by God himself, not with dirt.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.360]   And that's why they were able to walk this journey and live all their lives as aliens
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:36.520]   and strangers, leaving behind what was familiar to them.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:42.960]   You see, there's so many people who are Christians who came into the faith thinking, "I'm going
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.120]   to follow Christ," and then have been waiting month after month, year after year, maybe
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.480]   possibly decade after decade, waiting for a payoff.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.680]   But that payoff never came, at least not the way we imagined it.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.040]   Life remained hard.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.760]   Relationships with other human beings became hard.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.680]   Serving the church became hard.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   Business became hard.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.800]   Raising children was hard.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.160]   And so every experience, every stage of life, we're waiting for some kind of payoff.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.720]   I've been faithful, I've been sacrificed.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.380]   I picked up my cross, I did what you asked me to do.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.940]   And where's the payoff?
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:30.540]   And because payoff never came, and all we were, and all we are experiencing is rejection.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.000]   I was willing to be an alien and stranger in the beginning.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.480]   I was willing to sacrifice for a period.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.520]   But the rest of my life, this is it?
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.180]   This is the payoff?
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.600]   And so what did a lot of confessing Christians do?
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.160]   They went back.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.600]   They went back home.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.400]   God's not answering my prayers.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.800]   He's not fixing my problems.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.440]   I don't feel accepted anywhere.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.080]   And so they went back home.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   He said, but Abraham and Sarah, they realized at some point in their journey that their
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.120]   home is not here.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.240]   That the promised land that God promised them was future, and they longed for that, and
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.320]   they kept on going, even though they never saw the physical promise happening in their
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   life.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.880]   And that's why it says God is not ashamed to call them his children.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.400]   You know what's interesting with all the COVID that's going on?
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.160]   All the COVID that's going on, you know, so many people are going camping and outdoor
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   and all this stuff.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.720]   And I don't know if you've ever looked into it recently, all the camping gear, the price
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.760]   has gone up, you know, like crazy.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.880]   Before all this pandemic, you know, the portable toilets were being sold for like $30, $40.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.400]   Now it's like in the hundreds, $120, $130, because it's in high demand.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   Portable toilets are in high demand, right?
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.400]   So it's become really popular to go camping and go off-road and all that stuff.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:10.000]   You know what's interesting is that people who have permanent homes fantasize about being
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.440]   homeless for a period.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.120]   Going off-road, peeing on the side road, sleeping on the floor.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.720]   They fantasize about being homeless.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.240]   What would it be like to be homeless out in the woods for a while, right?
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.200]   And then people who are nomadic, because you don't have a permanent home, you know, that's
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   all you're thinking about.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   We're going to settle down somewhere someday.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.280]   We're going to buy a house and we're going to be in this neighborhood.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.720]   We're going to settle down someday.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.680]   And whether you have a permanent home, whether you're a nomadic just moving around, that
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   longing to want to be permanent, to be home, is inside of all of us.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.600]   But the danger is when we begin to think that somehow, somewhere, that if we get this, if
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.120]   we buy a home, if we move, if we do this, that we're going to finally belong.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:03.600]   See, that's why Abraham and Sarah is an example for us as wanderers, simply because God promised.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.200]   They left everything and just followed.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.720]   Meaning that the payoff is coming, is not here.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.520]   You're going to have periods of time when you're going to experience great fellowship,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.840]   and there's going to be periods of time in your life when you're going to feel like you're
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.120]   rejected by everybody.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.640]   There's going to be periods when you're financially stable, and there's going to be periods when
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.720]   you're begging God to help you feed your kids.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.280]   There's going to be periods when you're in full health, there's going to be periods when
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.320]   sickness comes and it just doesn't leave.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.000]   But no matter what we experience here, we're all just wandering in the desert together.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.240]   He says your life is hidden now with Christ.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.760]   But when Christ who is your life, when He comes, when He comes in glory, you will also
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.360]   be glorified with Him.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.560]   That's why the Bible speaks about the second coming of Christ as redeeming His children
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.960]   to bring us back home.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:09.880]   You know Moses, Moses is somebody that I always look to for encouragement.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.680]   Moses and Paul.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:18.280]   Not because of their great faith, but because, I don't know why, it may just be, but I find
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:24.560]   more encouragement with whining and complaining of Apostle Paul.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   He's wrote some great letters, you know Philippians, like rejoice always, and I get sent to rejoice,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.640]   like that's great.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.880]   And I read, you know, 2 Timothy, it's like don't be like these people.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.080]   They all abandoned me, they all went home, right?
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.600]   And I said, oh man, Apostle Paul, and he died like that.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:48.480]   I look at Moses' life, I think he would have been perfectly content taking care of sheep
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   all his life.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.400]   God calls him and said I want you to go talk to some, I want you to lead my people out
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.120]   and he said no, no, no, not me.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.600]   I stutter, I call my brother and then God actually is angry with him.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.000]   You think I'm calling you because I need you?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   I made your mouth.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.760]   So God literally twists his arm, right?
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.160]   Okay, okay, he goes.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.040]   And while he goes, the Israelites are not thanking him.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.160]   You know, like when great things happen, it's like God is so good.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.840]   When bad things happen, this guy, you sent this guy.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.360]   And he's constantly turning around and I could tell, like you know, in the beginning, he's
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.560]   trying to be a good leader.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   He's begging God, you have to come with us.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.720]   Think about the reputation, you sent this out and if we all die in the desert, what
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.880]   was all that trauma for?
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.600]   And he's begging God, you have to come with us.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.280]   As if God wasn't going to go.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.560]   I think he was trying to make a great leader, right?
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.640]   But at the end of the 40-year journey that he didn't even want to go, after 40 years
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.120]   of whining and complaining of the Israelites, right before they enter the promised land,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.120]   they do it again.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.480]   I'm thirsty.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.840]   And he's, Moses just had it.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.920]   Like we're about to enter the promised land, you're going to do this again?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.440]   And he comes to God, whoa, what do you want me to do?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.640]   And he's like, give it to them, right?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.040]   God is so patient.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.880]   He goes and he takes his staff and he strikes the rock.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.780]   Water comes out, they drink it, they're happy.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.980]   But God is upset.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.820]   You did not show me as holy, so you will not enter the promised land.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.820]   I remember reading that for the first time.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.220]   I was like, what?
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.700]   This guy was faithful for 40 years.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.860]   You twisted his arm and you made him go down this path and he's at the entrance and he
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.100]   didn't commit idolatry.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.620]   It wasn't adultery.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.380]   He hit the rock too hard.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.700]   And I'm not exactly sure what he did.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:35:00.020]   Because I went and exposited and I read sermons and all these people were like, from the text
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.280]   I don't get it.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   What did he exactly do?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.820]   Did he hit it too hard?
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.420]   Did he yell?
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.220]   Whatever it was, it was too much.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   And God said, you didn't show me as holy.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.420]   Like, what did he do?
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.420]   And I remember reading that for the first time.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.940]   I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.300]   If he got in trouble, he couldn't enter the promised land because he didn't ... Whatever
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   he did, he didn't do it right.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   Show me as holy.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.300]   He didn't get to the promised land.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.860]   I was like, I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.620]   That's what's going to turn out to be?
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.540]   All that drama and then you soak it up and then at the end of your life you can't go
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.580]   in?
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.700]   I still don't get it.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.500]   At least for that part.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.940]   But one of these days we're going to get to heaven and we'll probably, I don't know if
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.660]   we're going to be able to see Moses face to face.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.860]   Maybe he'd be too close to the throne of God.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:04.980]   But if we do see Moses in heaven, I don't think Moses is going to say, I can't believe
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:11.340]   he didn't let me go in.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.740]   He didn't let me cross the line.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.420]   For 40 years that's all I wanted to get into the promised land.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.340]   I wanted to touch that dirt.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.180]   I wanted to set up my tent.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:30.900]   I don't think Moses is in heaven complaining about where he is.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:37.620]   If you look at it from God's sovereign perspective, God actually delivered Moses because Israelites
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.860]   entered the promised land and you think Israelites were complaining and grumbling in the 40 years
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   in the desert.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.340]   That was the highlight of their life.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.540]   That was when they were the most obedient.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.420]   As soon as they crossed the line, I mean, they started setting up altars and started
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.420]   worshiping.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.580]   I mean, it's almost like God spared him.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.300]   You know, all the things that we long for during this 40 years of wandering in the desert
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   where we're not there yet.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:10.180]   Do you think any one of us will be in eternity and look at this, oh, man, how come my business
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.140]   didn't succeed?
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.860]   I didn't get to go here.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.340]   I didn't experience this.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:24.140]   You think any one of us is going to be in eternity in the glory of Christ and going
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:30.020]   to remember and regret anything that we grumble about here?
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:38.180]   In fact, sometimes God allows us to experience that to remind us that we don't belong here,
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:44.780]   that our treasure is not here, that this is not our home, that these are not my people.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:50.060]   One day, if we continue to persevere and walk in faith, that we will be where God called
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.660]   us to be.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.500]   In Philippians 3, 20 to 21, for our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:03.580]   for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our humble state into
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:10.060]   conformity with the body of his glory by the exertion of the power that he has even to
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.020]   subject all things to himself.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:22.060]   So again, as we meditate upon Abraham and Sarai, don't just remember the highlights.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:29.140]   Remember, they were people just like us, average people, normal people who believed in an awesome
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:37.580]   God that we may leave behind what holds us back and live the rest of our lives as aliens
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.460]   and strangers longing for the second coming of Christ.
