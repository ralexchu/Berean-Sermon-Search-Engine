[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.920]   Hello everyone, welcome to the last session, session 16 of the Ephesians study for this
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.880]   part 1. Remember that next week we'll be taking a one-week break and then on June 2nd I will be
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.440]   posting the first session of the part 2 of Ephesians and so that session is going to be nine weeks long
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.080]   and we're just going to go week to week straight through. If you would take a moment to bow with me
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.320]   and pray as we jump into our study for tonight. Let's pray. Our God we want to thank you for your
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.480]   precious Word. We again want to thank you so much Lord that because of your incredible and inexplicable
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.440]   love, that because of your parental love, you desire to see in us a growth, you desire to see in us a
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.280]   maturity and a transformation to the likeness of your holiness to God the measure and stature of
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.040]   your Son and we just again want to thank you for that and pray that your Spirit would all the more
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.920]   challenge us in our hearts and our mind but also God challenge us in our daily living. We thank you
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.880]   Lord for your precious Word it's in Christ's name we pray, amen. Okay so we're going to be studying
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.040]   this last paragraph of chapter 4. Let me take a moment to read it for us and it says, "Therefore
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:47.960]   laying aside falsehood, speak truth to each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.440]   another. Be angry and yet do not sin, do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not give the
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.000]   devil an opportunity. He who steals must steal no longer but rather he must labor, performing with
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.280]   his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need. Let no
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.920]   unwholesome word proceed from your mouth but only such a word as is good for edification, according
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.840]   to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not grieve the Holy
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.800]   Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.000]   anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice. Be kind to one another,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.960]   tender-hearted, forgiving each other just as God in Christ has forgiven you." Okay as we take a
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.640]   look at this passage, it is also again for an inductive study like this a little bit lengthy
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.680]   and so we should do an overview. Okay remember that this passage has for us a specific
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.000]   application that's been building since the verse one of chapter four and so what we realize
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   actually is this is a more specific application of the various principles we've learned already.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.200]   The principles that were found in verse 17 through 24 which told us to stop living like the Gentiles
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.240]   in both thinking and in desire and so it said to put off your old self but rather to put on,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:29.000]   to put on the things that we know are true of us. What's more in verses 7 through 16 there was lots
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   of principles but essentially what God desired for us is that we would all attain to this unity.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.720]   Essentially this unity would be the growing maturity to the measure and stature of Jesus
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.280]   Christ so what he expected was that every single one of us in every single way would grow towards
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840]   Christ and in so doing we'd be responsible for ministry. We'd be growing closer and closer
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.560]   together and what's more, previous to that remember in chapter one there is a walk worthy principle
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.960]   which essentially taught us to walk worthy of this incredible calling that we reviewed all the way
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.360]   from chapter one through three and so the idea is this great incredible salvation we have, this
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.000]   great and incredible completeness that we have in Jesus Christ is supposed to now take effect in
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.600]   our walk. Okay, taking a look at this passage as an overview then there are very specific things
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.560]   outlined for us in this passage. I have some blanks for you there on your packet just highlighting what
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.080]   we're supposed to put off. The passage tells us to put off falsehood from our lives. It also tells
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.560]   us to not sin in our anger. Okay, to not let the sun go down on our anger so it deals with anger.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.840]   What's more, the passage teaches us to not steal anymore. Steal no longer. Right, it also tells us
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.280]   to put off unwholesome words that our speech needs to be careful and then also renewed so unwholesome
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   words put off. Okay, it also tells us to stop grieving the Holy Spirit so stop grieving and
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.600]   then it tells us to put aside everything related to bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, slander that
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.880]   all these things including malice must be put away. And so I have this outline for you as an
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   overview that this passage has, you can count, six things that we need to be putting away and if you
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.680]   include all the various things included in the letter F that's actually a lot of other things.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.840]   So again, as you can see there's a lot to cover in this passage and we're not going to be able to
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.920]   dive into each one fully in just the hour that we have but again for us it's up to us to make sure
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   that we're asking the right questions. What does that mean then? And if we're supposed to be putting
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   off certain ideas and concepts, what is included in that concept? So let's at least make sure we go
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.360]   through each one and we begin with making sure that we put off falsehood and put on truth. So
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.960]   therefore laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor for we are members of
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.280]   one another. Now we ask this question, what are some examples of falsehood? And what I like to do
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.120]   is rather than giving you all the various examples of meditation or meditating through that, I leave
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.600]   that for your discussions in your small groups and also I leave that for you to actually answer.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:33.280]   What are the many forms, many scenarios in which we exercise falsehood? Now right now with our BAM
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   ministry, our Strangles Adult ministry, we are going through this seminar called Own Your Fears.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.360]   And what's really interesting about this is that I realized after not only just looking at scriptures
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.560]   but examining life, our fears cause us to lots of silly things whether it be to run away but one of
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.520]   those things that it causes us to do is lie. It almost feels so instinctual for us to lie to get
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.280]   out of bad situations, to lie to get ahead in fear of either getting in trouble then or losing out
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.560]   on an opportunity. We are so tempted to lie all over different circumstances and places and even
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:23.480]   in something as neutral as basketball, even on the court, there are temptations to lie. So as we
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.200]   think about this, I recognize that this challenge for us to lay aside falsehood could be a difficult
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   one. And take a moment to observe that the command then actually includes an interesting compound
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.920]   idea here, which is that you should be laying aside, which is a participle. That is an ongoing
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:52.160]   activity and the imperative is you should be speaking truth. And then so you realize sometimes
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.960]   when we think about our own struggle, right? In order for us to speak the truth in a certain
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   moment, man, we have to pull away the already, I guess, dirty clothes that we have, right? In this
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.280]   whole analogy of putting off and putting on, the already dirty clothes that we have and the
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:20.120]   instinctual kind of knee-jerk reactions we have to lie to save face. We need to make sure that the
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.600]   knee-jerk reaction, I mean, sometimes we don't have to be even creative to lie. It just comes out in
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.720]   the moment, right? And what we have to do is regularly fight those temptations. It is a difficult
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   thing to do. And I ask you to meditate. Why is it sometimes so difficult for us when someone asks us
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.000]   even an opinion, a personal opinion, we are calculating certain things. And then we always
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.440]   try to give a safe, safe answer. Whether it's just to appease the person who asked, why is it so
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.560]   difficult for me to even expose what I'm actually thinking? We have to meditate on these things. And
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:03.920]   we realize that speaking the truth sometimes is a lot more difficult than we think it is. And so
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.880]   this is a huge challenge for us. But also I want us to notice within this passage that there is
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.560]   motivation. And what he says is, "For we are members of one another." And so we have to ask
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.040]   the question. We observe the rationale clearly that because we're members of one another, we
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:29.480]   have to speak truth to each other. But how does our membership motivate my honesty? Why is it that
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.080]   as members, we have to speak truth to one another? Well, in order to just kind of meditate about
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:43.720]   this, I have an example, which is I think about our church and I'm so grateful that the departments,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.600]   I guess you could say, or the service teams that we have. I mean, we have close to, I think I
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.440]   counted was 27 different service teams. Now, some of these service teams, they're not like big teams
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.600]   and they're not doing a whole lot of like every week activity, but these teams exist to help
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.800]   support all the various ministries of the church. And if these teams didn't exist, there'd be
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.720]   something that would be neglected. Okay? But then you can imagine amongst 27 teams, and also we
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.120]   have, you know, four different affinities. We have the education department, college, youth, and all
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.080]   this kind of stuff. Right? When you think about that, there is potential there for competition
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:27.600]   amongst departments. And what's really interesting is that if each service team lead, each affinity
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.520]   group leader was not godly, but actually competing with each other, and maybe they were competing
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.480]   for budget, maybe they're competing for personnel. And they started to say, well, I want that service
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.320]   leader. Maybe it's Matt Chong. Like I want him on my team. And the other person says, no, I need him
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.720]   for youth. And another person says, no, I need him to build stuff at church or whatever it may be.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:55.400]   Right? Now, as soon as you have that kind of motive of competition, there has to be a rationale.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:02.000]   So what ends up happening? You sometimes exaggerate your need. We have nobody. Right? And then so
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.320]   sometimes even with budget, people do this. They realize like, oh my gosh, we have leftover
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.680]   budget. Then pizza party for all, and we're going to give gifts to. Why? Because you're trying to
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.000]   bump up your budget to make it seem like you have all these expenditures. Do those kind of things
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.480]   ever take place? It can if we don't check our hearts. And so I just want to give that example.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:30.600]   Why? Because if we're members of one another, if one piece is just as important as another, if the
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:39.320]   education department and the college department and the welcome team are all elements of the body
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.480]   like the scripture says, that's the eye and the nose and the ear. Think about how ridiculous it
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.560]   would be that the eye would compete against the nose. Think about how ridiculous it would be for
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.160]   your arm to compete against your thigh. I mean, those kinds of examples just are a little bit
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.120]   silly, but that's how ridiculous it would be. We are all a part of the body and therefore rely on
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.840]   each other, not compete with each other. And that kind of competition, a threat to each other is
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:14.560]   sometimes a great motive behind the lying. Okay. Let's go move on to the next one. Number two, put
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   off anger and put on what was tough. Sometimes I wish it was just clearly spelled out for you, but
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.520]   clearly there's some things we're supposed to put on in the whole pattern of the teaching. But this
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.000]   passage says, "Be angry and yet do not sin and do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.720]   give the devil opportunity." Now this exhortation and admonishment has a lot of questions. Hey, wait
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.000]   a minute. Why does it say, "Be angry"? Shouldn't it say, "Don't be angry," right? Because am I
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.160]   supposed to actually be angry about stuff? And why is it that in personal experience, I always feel
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.600]   guilty whenever I get angry, you know? And also it just seems very contrary to expectation here.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.960]   And what's more, what is this principle about not letting the sun go down on your anger? Now,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.560]   what's very clear is you notice I highlighted for you guys that there is a repetition of the do
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:20.760]   nots. So clearly what you find here then is you're supposed to, at some points, you're allowed to
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.880]   provision for, you're supposed to be angry in the sense that there are things that anger us. But
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.840]   there are cautions and warnings that clearly tell us that it can go wrong so fast. Okay? Now I ask
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.000]   this question again, but what are we supposed to put on? Like, are we supposed to put off anger
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.720]   and also then put on anger? What are we supposed to do here? Now, I want us to think about this,
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:49.000]   and this is a great opportunity to do a word study. If you're looking at a term that says,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.520]   "Be angry," and you're like, "Well, I understand the word angry, but clearly there's kind of more
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.400]   than meets the eye," or at least, "I need to know what he's talking about specifically," do a word
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   study. And what we find is that there are two different words for anger in this passage. Notice
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   it says, "Be angry," the Greek word is "orgie," yet, "Do not sin." Do not let the sun go down on
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.320]   your, and it doesn't actually repeat the same word, but it uses a different word, "paragizmo."
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.840]   Now, the idea here then, the translations are pretty similar. It says, "Wrath, make angry,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.400]   provoke," but the first term is passive, and it's used in lots of different contexts. However,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:37.720]   the second word is to make angry to a violent or bitter anger, and is only found here. Here is the
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.840]   word dictionary of the New Testament, says this, "Although both paragizmos and orgie are translated
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:49.560]   wrath, they are not the same in meaning. On the one hand, paragizmos signifies the kind of severe
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.840]   or violent anger which arises from direct provocation, an aroused anger, or seething
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.440]   exasperation. Such behavior is contrary to the Spirit and the Word of God. On the other hand,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.880]   orgie refers to anger in general, and though it is used of sinful anger, it is also used of
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:13.480]   righteous indignation, such as certain passages." Okay? So, take a moment to think about that,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:20.920]   and you realize that what he's trying to say then is when you look at this passage, yes, there are
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.440]   times and moments where because of what you're getting angry about, and because of how you're
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.960]   getting angry, and because to what end, right? Like what is causing you to do, all those things
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:38.520]   matter. So, if you're getting angry in righteous indignation because of the blasphemy of God,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.160]   or some kind of dishonor to the Lord, or some kind of injustice towards the oppressed and the
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:50.520]   helpless, that clearly is a kind of anger we've seen within Scripture. But is there an ungodliness
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   in you that is self-righteously angered because you didn't get honored? Is it controlled? Is it
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.880]   a controlled passion where there's clear thinking, there's still truthfulness of words, or is it
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:12.040]   violent, uncontrolled, raging, right? But what's more, there's this interesting kind of caveat
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:19.480]   here that tells us, "Do not sin, do not let go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.240]   opportunity." So, here are the warnings. The warnings of not doing this, and not doing that,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.400]   and not doing this. Now, this part of it I thought kind of funny because I remember reading some
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.200]   books about anger, and in one book, I remember it saying, "Man, you have to resolve anger then and
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.920]   there." So, it was actually one of the marriage books that I read that talked about how you have
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.440]   to resolve then and there. Now, I am one that has a hard time doing that because I have to think
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.640]   through, "Why am I feeling this way? What am I actually even feeling? How do I put it into words?"
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.200]   And it takes me a while, okay? So, I'm not good with resolving then and there. What's funny is
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.280]   that through a story the book was trying to teach, like, you have to resolve it quickly though.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.960]   Husband and wife, husband and wife gets in a fight. It's late into the evening. Perhaps the
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.680]   gentleman says, "You know what? I don't want to fight like this anymore. Let's talk about it
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.040]   tomorrow." He goes to bed. He wakes up and he realizes his wife is now four times as mad as
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:20.360]   before because she's thinking, "How could you sleep?" Right? She stayed up all night. "How could
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:26.040]   you sleep? Don't you even care?" Right? Now, what's funny is I read another book that said, "Hey,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:32.920]   don't take this literally, okay? If you're fighting at 2 a.m., you don't have sobriety.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:38.200]   You're tired. You don't have the motivation to be cautious with your words. This is not some
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.920]   literal wooden principle where you have to make sure that the sun doesn't go down because if you
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.800]   start fighting at 10 p.m., the sun's already down, right? It's not literally supposed to be taken.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:54.040]   So, there's some kind of wisdom there, but the wisdom simply is this. If you allow anger to grow,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:02.680]   it gives fuel for such other vices. Whether it be judgment, resentment, bitterness, hatred,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.000]   Satan uses that as a means for scheming. And so, as a challenge to you, you have to think about,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.440]   does your anger fuel more godliness? Does it fuel truthful words that helps the other individuals?
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:24.040]   Or does it fuel some kind of retribution, some vindictiveness? Okay? All right.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.520]   Moving to the next point here, number three, the put off and put on principles. It says,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.680]   put off stealing and put on generosity. Passas says, "He who steals must steal no longer,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:42.520]   but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.320]   to share with one who has need." Okay? As a reminder, this is kind of interesting because,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.640]   you know, I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of you out there aren't going to the liquor store
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.760]   and stealing candy like we used to when we were kids, right? Maybe it was just me, you know,
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.080]   guilty I did that because there was a lot of adrenaline when you're a kid. But when you're
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.880]   older, obviously you don't steal. However, however, this passage is speaking to the general public,
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.800]   it's teaching churches. Yes, it's written to Ephesus, but it was meant to be circulated.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.160]   And what we find is that these are major areas of life that we struggle with. And it's some,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.560]   it's kind of like a universal pattern. And there's a lot of questions like, "Wow, what can we learn
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   about the nature of stealing that entices so many people? And what are the different forms of theft
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.920]   that perhaps we struggle with even to this day?" And again, I want you to think about it and
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   meditate. Why is it that even as adults sometimes, I mean, think about how many get rich quick
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.120]   schemes there are, and it's been around for ages, and yet they still somehow capture people's,
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:20:00.040]   you know, tempts people. And perhaps because the demand is already right here. And what form of
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.280]   stealing is there? Whether it be taking credit for something that's absolutely not yours,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:12.920]   at work taking credit for things, at work stealing work property. Like, is there stealing that
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.080]   happens within the workplace now that it's a little bit more sophisticated as opposed to at
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.920]   the liquor store? Perhaps. Copying and pasting when you're studying. I mean, there are many forms
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.560]   that we can think about, but you can take time to think about that. All I want to say is this,
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:34.920]   what's really interesting here, if you notice, is he who steals must steal no longer. Is that
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.680]   stealing actually in terms of the selfishness and the rationale of a thief that's there,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.080]   it is so enticing, it typically becomes a pattern. It typically becomes a pattern,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.280]   it typically becomes a way of life, and it's not just reserved to sticking something in your pocket.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.640]   And so what I'm saying is we have to be warned against this temptation. Now, when we think about
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:04.600]   the put on, please observe that there are actually two things that Apostle Paul challenges us to put
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.240]   on in order to put off our former self in the selfishness that we have. And the very first thing
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:22.040]   he says is actually to labor. He says, "Rather labor, performing with his own hands what is good."
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:32.520]   Okay, what is good? And so I want to give this admonition. Notice that when there is a pattern
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:39.000]   of perhaps the flip side of what it means to labor, which is to be a free bird, kind of an
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.280]   individual who likes to get things for free, an individual who likes to maybe write off the work
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.240]   of others, an individual who has expectations that everybody else is supposed to parent their
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.600]   lives and provide for them and carry their weight, an individual who does not know how to carry their
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.880]   own burden. These are the rationale of the individuals who perhaps may be tempted with
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:07.320]   stealing. Now, on the flip side, remember that Apostle Paul, he said in scripture, whether it be
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.840]   in 1 Thessalonians, he says, "I work day and night not to be a burden to any of you." Right now, we
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.640]   don't have to go the extreme. If an individual gives you a gift, receive it with gratitude.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:26.200]   However, do not go around expecting that people is going to always provide for you your needs.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:34.600]   Why? Because that kind of rationale lends to temptation. What's more, he says, "Put on generosity."
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.840]   He says, "You may not be necessarily having this gross pattern of stealing where you're
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.320]   going to the store and grabbing stuff, but an individual who steals, in order to combat that,
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.760]   you have to actually put on an intentional giving that you would actually not only work,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.000]   but that working, you would not just raise money and say, 'Now, I took care of myself,'
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.760]   but now you have to be so intentional and say, 'I worked and I deserve the fruit of that,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.840]   but I'm going to now take that and give and sacrifice.'" And what you realize is, man,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:12.360]   generosity is not something you have an arbitrary standard by. How much should you give?
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:19.480]   Generosity doesn't have the kind of logic that the thief has, which tries to maximize.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:25.640]   If I work this few hours and can get this much reward, then of course, that's the rationale.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.600]   But this generous individual says, "I could work this much hours, but I could give this much."
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.800]   It's not a logic of cost-benefit analysis. Rather, it's a kind of love that comes from
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.200]   the wealth that we have in Christ. And so that's a huge challenge for us.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:50.840]   Next, number four, "In the pattern of the put-off of the unwholesome words and to put on words of
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:58.760]   edification and grace." Okay. Here, he says, "Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:05.160]   but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.960]   will give grace to those who hear." Now, this is a big, big challenge because in our regular than
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   daily social life, this is something we have to make sure like we're on top of. Because scripture
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.440]   actually says, "You know what? We all stumble in many ways, but man, if you could keep a rain on
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.920]   your tongue, that's huge." Okay. I mean, read James chapter three. Remember how the scripture talks
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.840]   about your mouth as one of the most powerful weapons you have. I mean, you think about
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.960]   something with power, right? Like a ship has a little rudder and that thing changes course,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.600]   right? I mean, think about the spark that ignites a fire in the forest. I mean, the power contained
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.640]   in our mouths is so much. Here, the challenge is to put aside all unwholesome words. And here,
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.960]   we could take some time to think about some questions. Yeah. What does this unwholesome
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.160]   words mean? What's practically included in that? And a big, big question that a lot of us are
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.000]   going to ask is, "Does this include joking? Like, can I be sarcastic? Is it okay to kind of be
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.720]   witty and go back and forth with my bro?" Now, that's something actually to think about, right?
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.840]   Because you could have an honest debate about that. Let's do a quick word study again, because
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.200]   sometimes if we're confused about what does this concept include, it's good to do a word study.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:30.600]   Now, I'm just going to show you this. Here, it talks about words that are rotten or putrid.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:38.440]   It is a very descriptive word. Words that decay. Word that causes this stench. And so,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:44.120]   even in our modern terms, we have a modern way of saying, "Man, that guy has a potty mouth,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.760]   like a foul mouth," right? So, clearly this passage is not talking about like, "Hey,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.800]   you said something slightly insensitive. Now, should you do that?" No, the answer is no.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.480]   But this passage is more so talking about things that are vulgar, right? Things that are distasteful
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:06.200]   and real putrid, okay? Now, as we think about this though, it doesn't just stop there. When it tells
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.840]   you to put on the kind of words that you should be speaking, please observe that it says, "Your
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:18.600]   words should be good for edification. Your words should be meeting the need of the moment. Your
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:26.280]   words should give grace." Wow. Now, some of us, we're so intuitive. I mean, we look at our brother
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.880]   and sister and we can sense their need and we can give them words of encouragement. And to me,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.080]   that's just, when I see people doing that, I'm like, "Man, that's so good." Why? Because scripture
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:44.280]   says that is such a valuable thing. Proverbs 25 verse 11 says, "Like apples of gold in settings
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:51.640]   of silver is a word spoken in right circumstances." Okay? And I want you to observe something, right?
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:57.720]   It is difficult for us in every scenario in life to work through some kind of process where we're
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:04.040]   thinking like, "Is this good for them? Is this good for them? Is this like meeting their needs?
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.560]   Is this edifying them?" But I want you to think about that. Yes, that could be a bit cumbersome,
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:16.760]   but that is the kind of intentionality that God wants us to have. Here, He doesn't say,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.560]   "Put off unwholesome words and remember to always say thank you." Right? He doesn't give you the
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.720]   specific word and a formula, but what He gives you is an admonition for an intentionality of heart.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:34.520]   Your words need to be good for stuff. Your mentality needs to be meeting needs, and your
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.760]   intent should be to give grace. So that means if your heart is always poised in the right direction,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.320]   you're not sitting there constantly wondering like, "Is this right?" You're already intended
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.160]   on doing that. And so even in the area of joking, right? Because I asked the question I should
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.760]   address a little bit. If you're witty, good for you. Right? And I'm going to say something. You
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.040]   know all the guys at church who are like super good at puns? Thank you. Right? To all the masters
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.880]   that pun out of our church, it's a quick shout out to Dean. You're a master. Kevin Osako. Yeah.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   Chris Fonga. You're like a legend. Like we have so many people who are good at puns. You know why
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:19.320]   I love them? Because the point of direction of the fun is the pun and everybody could look and laugh
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:27.800]   at it. But when it's not so funny is when the joke is directed at a person and everybody is laughing
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.720]   at a person. Why? Because direction matters is what I'm saying. Intentionality matters.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:41.960]   What's the purpose of your wit? What's the purpose of your humor? Right? The question you really
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.160]   should be asking like, are you trying even to give someone grace by giving them joy and making
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.760]   them laugh? Or are you trying to give yourself a good laugh at their expense? Okay. Now again,
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:00.120]   I for one, I mean, some of you guys might be thinking, Pastor Mark, but you make fun of us
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.720]   quite a bit. I apologize. You know, like this is an area that I think I'm taking a little time on
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   because I need to hear it. Right? Like I'm going to be honest. There are times when I just try to
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.840]   be funny. And what I realized is because my direction is off, I find myself apologizing
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.040]   afterwards quite a bit. Okay. Now in the context of certain relationships, even if I make fun of
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:26.680]   somebody, we're on good terms or even making fun of each other, we could both laugh because we have
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.640]   that relationship and we could both laugh together. Right? And I could make fun of myself and we could
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   both laugh together. Again, I hope you guys understand that from the passage, what's pretty
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.880]   clear is what you're putting on is an intentionality, even of the very words that you say,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.840]   that it's going to make sure that it's edifying, it's meeting needs and it's giving grace. Okay.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:59.160]   All right. Next. Okay. Next. Here is an interesting challenge for us. It says putting off
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:06.760]   grieving of the Holy Spirit and putting on, and it doesn't specify again. Look at the passage.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:13.000]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Boom. What a challenge. By whom you are sealed for the day
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.480]   of redemption. We have to ask some questions. How can we grieve the Holy Spirit? What are we doing
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.520]   that's grieving him? Right. And I'm not going to necessarily do a word study on grieving the Holy
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.600]   Spirit because I think it's translated well that the word doesn't need a whole lot of other
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.000]   synonyms because we understand what that means. Like you're making him sorrowful in a sense.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.520]   Right. And the, but the question is why is this general command inserted here amongst the list
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.800]   of very specific commands, like being careful of your words, being careful that your hands aren't
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.480]   greedy and lazy. These are very specific challenges that we need to apply into our lives here.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.800]   This challenge is a bit broader. And so a lot of commentators that think about this saying,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:03.320]   you know, why it's broad is because after giving some of these specific challenges, he's making us
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.880]   understand the motive. We need to do those things because we're grieving God. Right.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:15.160]   And that, that, that makes sense. But also I have to ask the question, like, how are we to perceive
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.920]   this? Like, what are we, if this is a motivation and let's really get that motivation, right? Stop
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.040]   grieving the Holy Spirit. Okay. And the way I want to make sure that we're getting to that motivation
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.920]   is asking this specific question. Why does my rotten mouth, why does my lazy and selfish hands
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:39.960]   of, you know, tempted to steal, why does that grieve my God? And so here we need to take a moment
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   to meditate and think, okay. So I want us to think about these ideas, about again, those specific
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:59.080]   commands. Why does it grieve our God? And I think what you naturally already get a hint at is that
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:08.120]   there is such a tie between us and the Holy Spirit emphasized in this passage. We are sealed by the
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:16.280]   Holy Spirit. Right. We're not talking about, we're not talking about just the, when they say seal,
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:22.920]   like a stamp, right. We're not talking about just simply an inanimate force. And whenever we talk
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.400]   about the Spirit of God, we're definitely not talking about something like air or water. Okay.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:33.960]   Just flowing down from all over the place. We're talking about a relational being who abides in us
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:40.760]   and with us and who has covered us and resides within. And when we think about these relational
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.640]   aspects, we recognize that in certain relationships that are so close and so intimate,
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:53.080]   if one person hurts, the other hurts as well. Right. So I want you guys to take a moment to
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:59.960]   think about those relationships where you care about an individual so much that for you, I mean,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.800]   when it comes to yourself, yeah, you could just absorb certain pains and you can make sacrifices.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.960]   But when it comes to a point where someone that you love is threatened, oh no, we can't have that.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.600]   So some of you like, you know, nude fathers out there, I know I sometimes talk to you guys who
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.640]   have little kids and stuff like that. Before when we were single, we never cared about getting ring
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.040]   monitors and like camera systems and stuff like that. But now we have things that alert us right
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.520]   away. We talk about home defense and some of us have little bats at home and stuff like that.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.240]   It's something, right? Why? If it's just ourselves, it's okay. Someone we care about,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:44.760]   if ever they got hurt under our watch, that would kill us. But I want you to think about this.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   For us, our relationship is not just any relationship that's close. Our relationship
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:34:01.720]   with God is one of father to child. We have to consider the depth of God's love. Why does my
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:13.080]   potty mouth, why does my stealing grieve God, the spirit of God? Because if any single one of us
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:21.320]   were to see our child speak vulgarities from their mouth in public, that would disturb us
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.560]   to the point where perhaps immediately we would move to discipline. What are you saying?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:32.760]   I taught you better, right? What's more on the flip side, if we saw our children hurting other
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.320]   people with their words, like what are you doing? But on the flip side, if some of you,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.160]   especially those of you guys who have older children, maybe those of you who have children
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.520]   who are in college, you reared them from they were a baby, an infant, you've took care of them,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:52.280]   you taught them and instructed them, you modeled for them, you gave them good examples, you send
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.920]   them off to college, and then you watch them from afar and you hope that they're doing well.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.280]   And then you visit them only to find that they're living in rags, they're living in filth,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:12.840]   and they're stealing from their neighbors. That would break your heart. Why? Because it's not just
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:19.960]   them sinning against rules, but it's not just them sinning against, transgressing against cold,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.240]   hard facts. It's not even just like, "Oh, I wanted you to contribute to the society." No,
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:35.800]   because that's your child living like they're wretched, living so far and distant from
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:41.640]   everything you wanted for them, all the good you prepared for them. Notice how this passage says,
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:48.760]   "By whom," it's not just the law, but it's the person of God, "you were sealed for the day of
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   redemption." God has prepared for us glory. God has prepared for us magnificent gifts of holiness,
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:05.400]   incredible treasures of things of God, right? He's prepared for us to be like Him.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:10.600]   But for us to live like that, that grieves the heart of our God.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:20.600]   Take a moment to think about that and appreciate the love of God and the parental love that He has,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.280]   where to see us not necessarily even being afflicted, but to see us in any kind of
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   unrighteousness and sin would grieve His heart. That's the love of our God.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:41.000]   And so we're thinking about this challenge that we're supposed to put off and put on,
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:48.600]   what are we supposed to put on? If we are supposed to be putting off the grieving of the Holy Spirit,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.520]   we should be putting on the desire for His good pleasure. We want to make sure that we understand
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.000]   the will and heart of God and to make sure that we're abiding in that. Now lastly, we move forward
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.560]   to this last exhortation where it says here, "Put off all evil and put on the love of Christ."
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.200]   Okay, there's a lot. I mean, if we wanted to, we could have just taken this one verse and then
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.840]   chopped it up and then started thinking through what is bitterness, what is wrath, what is anger?
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:23.160]   I'm going to leave that for you to do. You take time to meditate. Do I struggle with bitter thoughts?
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.840]   The lasting sourness. If you guys have ever felt bitter resentment for somebody and there's this
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:34.920]   lasting sourness where you fantasize about your hatred towards somebody and how horrible they are.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.120]   Is there wrath? Is there anger? Is there clamor? Is there slander? Now what I'm going to just say
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.280]   is I do believe there is some kind of build toward this. Like there's a bitterness, there's a wrath,
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:50.360]   there's an anger that moves typically for you curses or for you slandering, for you gossiping,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:55.000]   for you speaking ill of them and wishing ill of them. But what's all interesting is that this
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.040]   term for malice, again, malice is an intent of wickedness. Malice is a term that actually is
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:10.600]   used in so many variety of ways in scripture. It talks about all kinds of evils. It talks about all
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   kinds of vices that people have. And so essentially the intent of the heart is towards damage,
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:24.200]   inflicting harm, or some kind of hatred towards an individual. These are the things that sometimes,
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   yes, we are all tempted with. And sometimes we're tempted with those sentiments towards the people
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.800]   who are even within our own household. And what we have to do is overcome these things, putting
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:43.640]   them aside and putting on the love of Christ. The passage tells us that we need to put on the
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:50.680]   kindness, the tender heartedness, and the forgiving intention of Christ. Now I want you to think about
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:57.000]   that. There are times when you run into somebody who's just like, "We don't click." Right? It's
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.240]   just like, I cannot stand that guy. Right? Now, to some degree, that's all understandable because
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:07.320]   I don't think the scripture calls us to be accountability partners, one-on-one, best friend
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.440]   forever with every single person in the church. Not only is that, it's not possible with like 600
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.080]   people at the church, but neither is it the expectation that every single individual is
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.200]   always going to be buds for life. Okay. However, we have to exercise a certain kind of control by
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.960]   the love of Christ, right? The love of Christ controls us. Earlier, there was a passage that
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:37.080]   challenged us to put aside anger and to make sure that we're not allowing it to have a foothold.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:43.240]   That I believe was challenging us to put on control. Why? Because in control, there are
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.280]   limits so that although we are angry, we do not sin. There are limits so that although we are
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.160]   angry, we do not let it reside in our hearts forever. And there is some kind of control so
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:00.360]   that we do not allow it to be fueled even further and allowing the devil to fuel other kinds of
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:07.720]   schemes and revengeful type of thoughts. Here, likewise, what we're supposed to be controlled by
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:13.480]   is the kindness, tender heartedness, and forgiveness that we've received from Christ.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:20.600]   Right? I want you guys to ask yourself the question, to those individuals who just annoy you
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   like crazy, do you show irritation or are you controlled enough that you're still tender?
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:35.800]   Right? Do you show this kind of stiff arm wall or do you show a kind of like kindness, a gentleness?
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:42.280]   Even to the level of being cordial, like, are you able to do that with an individual who has
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:48.120]   hurt you? You know, one of the qualifications of a leader, it says that an individual is able to
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:57.800]   absorb when he is wronged. A lot of us, if we're wronged unjustly, if we're even accused of something
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:04.280]   wrong unjustly, right? It's difficult for us to exercise self-control. The challenge here is for
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:10.920]   us to put on, like actively put on the love of Christ, especially in those scenarios when perhaps
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.440]   we have rationale, reason, perhaps we have like evidence as to why it all makes sense that I
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:22.360]   should hate this person. For you, it all makes sense because you receive the love of Christ to
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.040]   put on kindness, tender heartedness, and forgiveness. And that's what I want to conclude with.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:32.760]   Notice how scattered throughout this passage, there were various motivations.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:39.400]   You see, broadly speaking, for us to be able to put off these elements of our former selves,
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:46.040]   it just goes to prove that we have been made new by Christ. It just goes to show who we are,
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:53.000]   the dying self is now being crusted and we're able to peel off the withering away of the old life.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.680]   And what we're supposed to do as those who have been sealed for redemption, forgiven by Christ
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:05.640]   and shown your incredible mercies, we're supposed to change. And that's been kind of my exhortation,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:13.400]   right? My exhortation hasn't been like, you guys need to, you know, go find your niche and bloom,
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.480]   right? It's the whole idea is from where you are, are you in whatever way God is showing you,
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:25.160]   changing and transforming to the image of Christ, right? What I'm saying is you don't have to go
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:32.440]   out and do fantastic, marvelous, like awe-inspiring things for the Lord to prove who you are.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:39.560]   What needs to happen? You need to daily change. You need to make specific applications of
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.320]   especially these patterns that are so common amongst all of us, that we are showing the Lord
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:52.920]   has affected in us, his great power. Let's take a moment to pray. God, we thank you so much
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.680]   for your word. Lord, there were many challenges within this passage that I ran through pretty
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:06.280]   fast and God, we recognize that we should take time to meditate in what areas of my life am I
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:13.720]   exhibiting so many of these former life past earthly patterns. And I pray by the power of
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.680]   the spirit in us, by the motivation of all that you are and all that you've done for us,
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:26.760]   God, that these things would become a joyous walk of growing and maturing in Christ.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.920]   I know Father Lord, that some of us are struggling and weak. And sometimes the pressure to,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.240]   to strive for Christ likeness is, is, is daunting and feels sometimes maybe even impossible,
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   but we trust you. We have faith in you, God, what you have called us to do, you will lead.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.560]   The spirit you have given to us is a guarantee. And I ask God that within the hardships of trying
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:59.240]   to walk after you, we would also exercise incredible trust. Lord, we have you as our example.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.280]   We have you as our power. We have you inside of us. So Lord, we thank you and we praise you.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.520]   It's in Christ. Let me pray. Amen.
