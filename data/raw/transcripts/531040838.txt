[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Thank you, Agnes.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:16.640]   As a pastor, there's a part of me that is so thankful for your testimony and what I
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.760]   know of Agnes.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.240]   I'm hoping in many ways that my own daughter can grow up to be similar and share a lot
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.000]   of these traits, and I'm sure your parents are very proud, so thank you for that testimony.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.160]   Well, it's Monday night, and each year our observance of the Passion Week begins on Palm
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.840]   Sunday, as you guys know, with Jesus' triumphal entry on a donkey into Jerusalem.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.160]   And we reflected on this yesterday, and so each evening this week we will be meeting
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.160]   here to reflect on each of the days leading up to Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.720]   The Passion Week, which means the week of his sufferings, is the most important week
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   in all of human history, and it's also central to the narratives of the four gospel accounts.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.680]   The man Jesus, you guys know, walked 30 years – 33 years on the earth, but nearly half
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.720]   of all the gospel accounts are devoted to the events and the teachings of just this
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.680]   single week.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.540]   During this week, most all things public – Christ's teachings, confrontations with religious
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.060]   leaders, and the events surrounding his trial – they all take place in Jerusalem.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.120]   But after each day, Jesus and his disciples, they walk about two miles and return to Bethany,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.420]   presumably to the home of Lazarus and his sisters.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.480]   So Bethany to Jerusalem, Jerusalem to Bethany, Bethany to Jerusalem, and much teaching happens
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   to and from, and also on the road.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   So this is the physical setting of this week – Bethany to Jerusalem, back and forth.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.160]   And this is a week in which we also see a lot of Jesus' emotions.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.840]   We see him weep, we see him rage, and elsewhere in the gospel narratives, we see more amazement
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160]   from Jesus than either weeping or raging.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.800]   But this week is different, and understandably, we see more emotion as Jesus heads toward
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.000]   the cross.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.160]   And you can tell a lot about the passions of a person's heart by what we see him weep
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.380]   over and what we see him rage over.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.400]   And you can observe a lot of what a person loves and what a person hates by outbursts
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   of these emotions.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.060]   And on Monday, Jesus is visibly very upset.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.840]   And there are two major things that Scripture points us to that take place on Monday.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.500]   The first one is the only miracle of destruction in the gospel accounts, where Jesus curses
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.700]   a fig tree while on his way toward Jerusalem.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.200]   The second is Jesus causing a scene in the temple where he overturns tables, chases away
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   the money changers, drives away those selling doves, and then he gets into it with the religious
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   leaders.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.080]   And we read that Jesus literally stands physically in people's ways so that they can't carry
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.700]   merchandise through the temple.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.840]   So this is possibly the most physically animated we have ever seen Jesus.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.400]   So Jesus curses the fig tree.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.200]   Jesus disrupts business at the temple.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.320]   The fig tree and the temple.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.880]   And there is a connection between these two events.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   The curse of the fig tree is a symbol of God's judgment on the temple.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.080]   The leafy fig tree, with all its promise of fruit, is as deceptive as the temple, which,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.660]   despite its religious activity, it's really an outlaw's hideout, a robber's den.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.680]   It had the appearance of fruitfulness, of holy sacrifice, but in reality it was barren
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.140]   of anything of worth.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.200]   So let's take a look at Mark's account together.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.480]   I'll be reading Mark 11, 15 to 19 for you, and it's up on the screen.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.960]   Then they came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.640]   were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.860]   and the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.860]   And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.600]   And he began to teach and say to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.640]   a house of prayer for all the nations'?
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.540]   But you have made it a robber's den."
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.200]   The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking how to destroy him, for
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.140]   they were afraid of him, for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.480]   And when evening came, they would go out of the city.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.640]   So here in verse 17, we see Jesus alluding to two Old Testament prophecies, Isaiah 56,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.840]   Jeremiah 7.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.320]   And I'm going to read little sections of both for you.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.280]   The first one, Isaiah 56, is one of the most uplifting chapters in all of the Old Testament.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.480]   In Isaiah chapter 55, he says, "Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   Call upon him while he is near."
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.980]   And then in 56, it describes reward upon reward for those who earnestly seek the Lord's face
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.980]   and obedience.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.880]   Okay, so I'm going to read verses 6 through 7 of Isaiah 56 for you.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.280]   "Also the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord, to minister to him and to love the
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.000]   name of the Lord, to be his servants, everyone who keeps from profaning the Sabbath and holds
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.420]   fast my covenant, even those I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.220]   my house of prayer.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.020]   Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on my altar, for my house
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.440]   will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples."
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.700]   The second passage, where the den of robbers is prophesied, has a very different feel.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:00.260]   So Jeremiah 7, 8 through 11 reads, "Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words to no
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.040]   avail.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:09.120]   Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and offer sacrifices to
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.800]   Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.760]   And then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.880]   'We are delivered,' that you may do all these abominations?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:34.480]   Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.840]   Behold, I, even I, have seen it, declares the Lord."
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.460]   So you can just tell that the mood of this is very different.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.720]   The temple of God was always meant to be a physical place where sinful man could draw
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   near in worship to seek holy God.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.960]   There had to be blood sacrifices, and humility, and a turning away from sins, and an earnest
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.900]   seeking heart of the worshiper to enable him to draw near to God.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.700]   And one of the first things that God had told Solomon after the completion of the temple,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.280]   it's found in 2 Chronicles 7, 14 to 15.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.600]   You guys, this is a very familiar passage, and many of you have memorized it, but let
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   me read.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:28.640]   "And my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.020]   and turn from their wicked ways.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.240]   Then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:46.780]   Now my eyes will be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place."
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.920]   So the temple was always meant to be a place where the worshiper could seek God, draw near
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.940]   to him, and to pray to him.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.440]   But in Jesus' day, the religious elite who profited greatly from the business at the
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:08.020]   temple had turned it into a place where they could use God for personal gain.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.440]   And it's important to remember that the Passion Week was during the Jewish Passover, and it
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.620]   was a time—and what is the Passover?
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.340]   It's a time where the people of God were to remember that God had passed over their
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:28.140]   sins by blood sacrifice so that they could be his people and that he could be their God.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:34.500]   But the opportunity of the holidays had great appeal, and so this had become a lucrative
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.660]   business for the religious elite.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.500]   They couldn't help themselves.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.140]   And they easily justified this.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.040]   After all, they were serving God, and God had ordained portions for their services in
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.100]   Leviticus and in the Book of Numbers.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.160]   They worked hard for God's blessings, so they deserved God's blessings.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.680]   And here's the problem.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:05.200]   The temple was meant to be a place of seeking God, but they had turned it into a place of
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.040]   using God.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.440]   They were using the spiritual needs of the people to satisfy the cravings of their idolatrous
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.340]   and their greedy hearts.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:26.540]   And in Jesus' actions, we observe the hatred that God has toward idolatry.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.280]   If you're a diligent student of the Bible, if you're just reading the Old and the New
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.560]   Testaments, one of the things you'll notice when you get to the New Testament is that
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.840]   the Hebrew race, who struggled nonstop for a millennia in the Old Testament, they're
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.100]   almost idolphobic when you get to the New Testament.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:52.060]   They were taught that physical idolatry had led to the loss of all their fame, their wealth,
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.500]   their power, and their land.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.820]   And so this entire group of people was kind of traumatized by the external practices of
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.140]   idol worship.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:06.980]   So statues, monuments, even coins that hinted of idol worship, they didn't touch with a
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.220]   ten-foot pole.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:16.920]   But their heart of idolatry, the heart they wanted to use God for personal gain, it had
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.900]   never gone away or had been dealt with.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.160]   So it had just become more sophisticated.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:31.420]   And this was very readily personified in the religious leaders who Jesus upset at the temple.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.080]   So there are a couple lessons we can learn today as we reflect on the events of Monday
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.540]   of the Passion Week.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.780]   And I'm going to leave you just with one very sobering truth.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:54.820]   The seeking of God and the using of God often looks the same.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:05.660]   The seeking of God and the using of God often looks the same.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:11.780]   The first is worship that is done in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:20.880]   The other is akin to a dancing around astral poles or bowing before golden calves.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:29.280]   At its root, the heart of worship cries, "I want to know you, Lord.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:37.020]   I seek first your kingdom and your righteousness, even if all these things do not get added
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.020]   unto me."
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.220]   You guys know that passage, right?
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:48.460]   The heart of a genuine worshiper of God seeks first his kingdom and his righteousness, even
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.260]   if none of the things get added.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:03.120]   But at its root, the heart of idolatry cries, "I want to appease you, Lord, and curry favor.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:10.860]   I want to seek your kingdom and your righteousness so that all these things can be added unto
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.860]   me."
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:22.220]   Given time, the worshiper, like the fig tree that was supposed to bear figs, it bears fruit.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.460]   The worshiper bears fruit.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.480]   The idolater does not.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.060]   The worshiper of Yahweh, of God, abides.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.100]   The idolater conforms.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:46.280]   The worshiper feeds deeply upon the word of truth.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   The idolater is satisfied with his ears being tickled.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.800]   The worshiper is broken and humbled.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:09.280]   The idolater is either smug or bitter, depending on the reward that he gets.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.520]   The idolatrous religious leaders got in the way of those who had come to the temple to
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   worship.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:25.520]   Idolatrous greed and fruitlessness, masked in religiosity, evoked a very passionate response
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.980]   from the Lord Jesus.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:36.920]   As we examine the events of this week, and today's just Monday, as we examine just all
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.840]   the days leading up to the cross, we're going to be introduced to many characters in the
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.320]   gospel narratives.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:54.440]   But for Monday, as I reflected deeply, just preparing just for this devotion, I was troubled
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:03.880]   a little bit and saddened, because I see elements in my heart, in my life, that closely resemble
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.360]   these religious leaders, and it has nothing to do with my occupation.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   There are elements in my heart that long to profit off of God for my kingdom, for my pleasure,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.560]   for my comfort, for my glory.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   And we learned yesterday that his kingdom is not of this world.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.480]   I'm not sure who you'll identify most with this week.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:42.200]   The Pharisees, the teachers of the law, the confused disciples, Judas Iscariot, perhaps,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:50.980]   the Roman centurion, the thief on the cross, or the ladies who grieve at the tomb.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.240]   Every single one of these characters, every single person in human history, and every
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.880]   single one of us in this room, and every single one of you watching online, there is a few
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   things that we all have in common.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:12.000]   We all have idolatrous hearts of stone that cannot be turned into hearts of flesh by effort
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.120]   or by adherence to religious conformity.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.360]   And we cannot save ourselves from idolatry.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.920]   We cannot help ourselves.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.400]   We are prone to worship the created things rather than the creator who is to be forever
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   embraced.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.800]   We cannot save ourselves from hearts that are idolatrous.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.680]   We cannot make our blind eyes see by our own effort.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.080]   We cannot make our hardened hearts very soft.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:59.440]   And we cannot draw near to God by effort or by our own endeavoring of righteousness.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.000]   We cannot do that.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.320]   Atonement had to be made.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.000]   Sin had to be defeated.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.560]   And today, I wanted to just reflect on idolatry.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   Mental heart transplants needed to be performed.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:28.440]   And hardened hearts have to be made receptive and fertile supernaturally.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   And each of these things we'll be reflecting deeply on over the course of this week, and
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:45.000]   especially through this weekend, as we understand that we cannot come to God on our terms, but
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.600]   we serve a God who is gracious and compassionate, just slow to anger, abundant in loving kindness.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.240]   He draws near to us.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:05.020]   But if we're not careful, we may reject this God and not know it.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.520]   Because the heart that seeks the Lord and the heart that desires to use the Lord on
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.760]   the surface may look the same.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:19.920]   So my hope and my prayer for our congregation is that over the course of this week, that
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:29.400]   our hearts would grow more and more broken over our sin, over our flaws, over our desperation,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.320]   that they would become much more receptive yet again with the constant reminders that
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:46.840]   holy God came down to meet man, sinful man, through the atoning work of his one and only
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.080]   beloved son.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:19:00.200]   So by the time we get to Friday, that Jesus' trials, his floggings, and his crucifixion
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:10.720]   would serve to remind us that we are absolutely and utterly just desperate and that we cannot
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.280]   help but to rely on the grace and the goodness of God.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:22.360]   So that on Sunday, when we're reminded that sin and death have been defeated, there will
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:29.880]   be shouts of acclamation and shouts of joy from people who understand their depravity,
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:38.000]   but understand better the great and mighty love of our good God and heavenly Father.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Amen?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Let's pray.
