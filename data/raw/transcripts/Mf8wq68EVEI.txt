[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.060]   Well, obviously we live in fractured and chaotic times.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.240]   And we also know that God's glory is important,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.580]   the most important thing in the universe.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.540]   So when we survey our world
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.060]   and we mentally run the numbers, so to speak,
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.740]   to find the evidence, which side of the scale tips?
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.260]   Does this world bring God mostly honor
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.900]   or does it bring God mostly dishonor?
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.980]   In creation and in this drama of human history,
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.620]   which side is winning out?
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.620]   I love unique big picture questions like this one today
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.460]   from a listener named Sam in Brighton, England.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100]   Dear Tony and Pastor John,
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.740]   I have been listening to your podcast for two years now
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.100]   and have found it invaluable in my own personal journey
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.060]   towards a Christ-centered life.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.980]   The key foundation of the APJ ministry
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.780]   is that God wishes to be glorified
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.460]   in the everyday actions of his creatures
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.300]   and that this is both satisfying and pleasing to him.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.140]   I greatly enjoy the study of history
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.600]   and what it tells us about the human condition.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.840]   My interests are in human conflict and approaches to peace.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.200]   So often it appears, however,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920]   that human history is full of violence, war, and suffering.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820]   My question is this,
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.420]   how does this enormous weight of non-God-glorifying acts
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.940]   stack up against God's desire to be glorified?
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.380]   I realize that God ultimately requires nothing from us,
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380]   but how can he be satisfied if, quite possibly,
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.020]   there have been far more God-dishonoring acts
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.380]   across the span of human history than God-glorifying ones?
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.140]   How does the philosophy of Christian hedonism
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140]   answer this imbalance?
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.020]   - Yeah, maybe, maybe it's the imbalance he thinks, maybe not.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.300]   Sam's observation is that, on the one hand,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.820]   the Bible teaches that God aims
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.460]   to be glorified in this world.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.540]   That's absolutely right.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.140]   God says, for example, in 1 Corinthians 10, 31,
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.340]   "Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink,
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.240]   do all to the glory of God."
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.220]   And Isaiah 43, 7 says that God's people are created
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.860]   for the glory of God.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.580]   And the prophets teach that eventually the earth
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.140]   will be covered with the glory of God
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.500]   like the waters cover the sea.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.140]   In Ezekiel 20, several times it says that just when
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.460]   it seemed that the world or the evil got the upper hand,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.460]   God says, "But I acted for the sake of my name, my glory."
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.100]   So it's really clear from the Bible that God intends
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   for nature and history and redemption
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100]   to serve the glorification of His excellence, yes.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.940]   Then on the other hand, Sam points out,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.060]   because he's a student of history,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.620]   that the world seems to be full
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.020]   of non-God-glorifying acts,
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.380]   more, he would think, than God-glorifying acts.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.820]   And he wonders how I would address that,
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.820]   especially from the standpoint of Christian hedonism.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.820]   So let me try in maybe, let's see, six steps.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.980]   First, I would observe that nature,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.160]   from the smallest subatomic particle
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.980]   to the largest gathering of galaxies,
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.540]   is constantly, without pause,
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.220]   and in millions upon millions of ways,
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220]   declaring the power and the wisdom of God in this world.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.060]   Every animal, every human mind and body,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.220]   every flower, every tree, every cloud,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.800]   every river, the sun, the moon, the stars,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.380]   and all the interworkings of these realities,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.380]   they all give an exquisite testimony
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.320]   to the brightness and truth of the glory of God.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   It would be difficult to quantify this
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   and say that somehow this is less, say,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.180]   than the calamities of the world,
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.460]   which might detract from the glory of God.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.420]   God is always and everywhere shouting
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.780]   the wisdom of all that he has made.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.340]   The heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.180]   In wisdom, he has made them all.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.720]   And just this morning in my devotions,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.860]   I read that section in Romans 1, 18,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.060]   to the end of the chapter, where it says,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.860]   "Everybody knows God, and from the creation of the world,
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.740]   "all the works that he has made
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.860]   "is revealing the invisible attributes of God."
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.180]   There's just no room for saying
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.940]   God is not revealing his glory
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.780]   continually through the things he's made.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.780]   So that's the first thing I would observe.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.220]   It is an overwhelming testimony,
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.040]   and oh, how blind the world is.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.700]   Second, I would draw attention to the phrase in the Bible,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.800]   that they may know that I am the Lord.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.480]   That phrase occurs 88 times in the Bible.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.060]   72 of them are in the book of Ezekiel.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.240]   That's amazing.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   Even more amazing is that this phrase is used
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.000]   both when God's people are being saved
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.040]   and when they are being judged.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.520]   It's used when secular nations are getting the upper hand
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.240]   and when they are being punished.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   So I think the intention is that in all of history,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.280]   whether we see it or not,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   God is acting for the sake of his name,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.320]   so that someday we will have eyes to see
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.480]   the way he worked for his name and his glory
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.280]   in the events that did not seem that way to us
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.560]   at all at the time.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.720]   Third, and this is the most clear and specific
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.080]   and stunning illustration of what I just said,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.580]   namely the cross of our Lord Jesus.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.360]   As Jesus comes to the end of his life,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.560]   and he contemplates that in the next hours,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.400]   he will be crucified, he prays like this.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.140]   This is John 12, 27.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.440]   Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.660]   Father, save me from this hour,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.960]   but for this purpose I have come to this hour.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.920]   Father, glorify your name.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.600]   Then a voice came from heaven,
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.320]   I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.600]   In other words, in the absolute worst,
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.440]   most sinful event in the history of the world,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.400]   the grace of God was being put on display,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.080]   and nobody saw it.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.880]   God's glory was shining.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.360]   The fact that nobody saw it doesn't mean it wasn't there,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.920]   and nobody saw it.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   And later, through the eyes of faith
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.080]   and with divine interpretation, we do see it.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.720]   That's what 2 Corinthians 4, 6 says.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   We do see it, but when it happened, nobody saw it.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.520]   And I think that's the way it is
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.400]   with most of what God is doing in this world,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   this fallen age.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.160]   Fourth observation.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.280]   When we ask why there is such pervasive failure
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.320]   on the part of God's people in this world
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.180]   to live a way that glorifies God,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.160]   and why the Bible itself is such a relentless history
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.040]   of failure by God's people, not to mention the nations,
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   Romans 3, 19 to 20 gives a remarkable insight.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.960]   So Paul has just finished indicting the whole human race,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.200]   Jew and Gentile, under the power of sin.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.320]   And then he says this.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.160]   Now we know that whatever the law says,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.100]   all those Old Testament quotations he's just given
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.680]   to show the pervasive sinfulness of the human race,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.320]   we know that whatever the law says,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.280]   it speaks to those who are under the law,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.400]   that's Jewish people,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.840]   so that every mouth might be stopped
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   and the whole world may be held accountable to God,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.600]   for by works of law,
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.840]   no human being will be justified in his sight.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.040]   In other words, one of the purposes
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   of the history of failure among God's people
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.760]   is to stop the mouth of every human being
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.680]   and make clear that no one can get right to God
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.120]   through law-keeping, but only through absolutely free,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.240]   glorious, sovereign grace.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.040]   So God intends to show that humans
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.160]   are in an absolutely hopeless condition,
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.960]   and thus to magnify the freedom
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.520]   and the beauty of his grace.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   Fifth, this leads to the observation that in the end,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.840]   we will be able to see the God-glorifying purposes of God
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.920]   more clearly than we can now.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.080]   Consider two images.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.280]   You've probably all heard these.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.680]   I find them both very helpful.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.760]   First, the imagery of a tapestry.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.800]   I think Corrie ten Boom used to talk about this.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.600]   Now we see the ugly, loose strands
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   at the bottom of the tapestry.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.880]   Nothing beautiful about it that we can see,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.800]   except by the eye of revelation.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   But then we will see it from the top,
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.280]   and the tapestry will be complete.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.840]   It will be beautiful,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.040]   with the strands all in their proper place,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.520]   and that will be what history is.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.220]   Or consider the image, similarly, of a painting.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.620]   God is now painting a mural of universal history
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.020]   and creation and redemption.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.740]   And as that mural comes into being,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.620]   we see this corner, we see that corner,
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.940]   we see this darkness, we see that little bright spot,
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.880]   and we can't make much sense out of it as a whole,
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.260]   just staring at a history
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.500]   with all of its mixed colors and shapes.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.640]   But in the end, when it's complete,
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.200]   everything will fit together, everything will make sense,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.580]   it will be a perfect display
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.660]   of the glory of God's wisdom and power and grace.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.100]   And the last thing I would say is,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   Christian hedonism says that God will succeed
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   in finishing the tapestry and completing the mural
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.500]   in such a way that there will be a perfect communication
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.340]   of the perfections and beauties of God
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.920]   in all their proper proportion.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   And God will succeed also in creating a people for himself
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.980]   who finally have eyes to see that glory
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.780]   for what it really is,
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.780]   and hearts finally able with appropriate intensity
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.960]   to delight in God's beauty the way they should.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.720]   And that delight will be the consummation
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   of the demonstration of the glory of the grace of God.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.080]   - Amen. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.920]   Great question.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.760]   I love it when questions get us
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   into these huge macro discussions.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.440]   And thank you for joining us today for it.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.520]   You can ask a huge macro question of your own.

[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.020]   Next week begins with a bang.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.400]   We're going to hear Pastor John give us 10 or 11
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.900]   of his favorite texts for his hardest battles in life.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.040]   John Piper's favorite biblical promises
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.060]   for life's hardest battles.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.200]   Cannot wait for that, but I must wait for that.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.320]   And you'll have to wait for that too,
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.500]   because it comes on the other side of the weekend.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reik.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.580]   You will see you back here on Monday morning.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.620]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
