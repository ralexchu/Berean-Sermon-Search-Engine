[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.000]   And God, also, we are grateful that we're

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.500]   Lord, I do pray that in the midweek,
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.000]   in the busyness of our schedules,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.500]   in the busyness of our workplaces and schools,

[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   And so Lord, with the devotion of this time and singing,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.780]   giving you our attention from your word,
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.760]   all be glorifying and exalting to you.

[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   For a few announcements for all of us,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.840]   this weekend on Sunday,
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.880]   for those of you who have missed the child safety training,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.280]   there's gonna be a second session.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.080]   It's gonna happen 1 p.m. at the upstairs Sprouts Room.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.760]   And so if you're able,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.200]   please make sure you sign up for that first.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.800]   As you guys know, the mandatory training
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.480]   is for anybody who desires to volunteer
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   with children in either VBS
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.340]   or in any kind of extended context.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.600]   We want people to be trained.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.240]   So if you have never gotten trained before,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.400]   please make sure you sign up for that.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.240]   The second thing I wanna push is,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.760]   today will be the last sign up for the BAM ministry.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.960]   We're trying to do what's called
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.000]   Summertime Koinonia Groups,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.280]   where the main goal really is to be able
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.080]   to connect with each other,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.640]   share prayer requests, talk about important topics,
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.360]   and then in that way, get connected.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   So it's gonna be three different meetings,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   and we're gonna divide people up into different homes.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.880]   And so for the summertime, it'll just be once a month.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.800]   If you're interested in participating in that,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.480]   please make sure to sign up today, okay?
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.520]   All right, well, please go ahead
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.080]   and enjoy your lovely snacks that you guys brought for today
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.720]   and then have great discussion
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.320]   and we'll be back here at eight.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   Thanks.

[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:17.560]   All right, for those of you guys in the rooms,
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   if you guys would make your way on out,
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.560]   I'm gonna go ahead and start our review of the passage
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.820]   and do our final review of the Book of Philemon.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:32.120]   Just, I'm starting about five minutes earlier.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.640]   But take a moment to get situated.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.760]   For those of you guys in the room,
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.160]   if you would make your way out,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.960]   we'll go ahead and start the review.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.120]   (audience chattering)
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:56.720]   Okay.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.560]   Today we're gonna do some review time,
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.520]   and then I'm also gonna be awarding some points
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.000]   for those of you guys who raise your hand
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.760]   and answer some questions.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.560]   I'll throw up an easy one while people get situated.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.240]   Who can guess what this photo is
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.040]   or make out what this photo is?
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:21.080]   You all have the look of confused,
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.320]   bewilderment on your face.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.280]   It's actually, I looked up a band of brothers,
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.140]   and then it's actually a bunch of people
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.840]   hugging each other, okay?
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.660]   And the reason why is because as the book is ending,
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:39.440]   there is actually a lot of just love,
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.040]   a lot of encouragement, confidence,
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.400]   and almost you could say even a host of witnesses,
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.000]   host of fellow workers, fellow brothers.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.040]   And that's the feeling that I got, you know?
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.960]   And so there you go.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.440]   It's an awesome photo.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.720]   Let me read us the passage for this evening.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.200]   Verses 21 through 25,
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   you guys have been discussing all night already.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.440]   And it says, "Having confidence in your obedience,
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.780]   I write to you,
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.820]   since I know that you will do even more than what I say.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.780]   At the same time, also prepare me a lodging,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.800]   for I hope that through your prayers,
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.980]   I will be given to you.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.180]   Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus,
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.180]   greets you, as do Mark, Aristocras, Demas, Luke,
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.500]   my fellow workers.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.420]   The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.900]   Okay, as we take a look at this passage,
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.660]   we have outline.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.660]   As you guys well know,
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.760]   I really, really enjoy seeing things in outlines
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.260]   to break up various portions of the text.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.940]   Here, we clearly have Apostle Paul saying,
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.420]   "I'm writing to you primarily because I know,
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.760]   I know you're going to be able to do it."
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.900]   What confidence Apostle Paul has, you know,
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.620]   over Philemon's character, over his ability,
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.260]   and ultimately though, what confidence he has
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.740]   in the spirit that's moving in Philemon.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.140]   Verse 22, "At the same time, also prepare me a lodging."
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.440]   So, you have this portion here,
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.220]   Apostle Paul is intent on, but also is predicting,
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.140]   I'm going to visit you in person, okay?
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.960]   I'm going to check in on you.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   Verse 23 and 24 has this long list of fellow workers,
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.420]   co-labors in the kingdom, okay?
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:36.380]   These men, and then I hope you guys have just the time
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.820]   to look up a few of them,
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.820]   'cause I think it was really interesting.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.780]   And then finally, closing grace,
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:48.260]   and is it just maybe familiar pattern as any other letter,
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.080]   but also always encouragement
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.020]   that the grace of our Lord will be with you,
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.100]   okay, no matter what.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.100]   So, as way of quick overview,
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.020]   what we have are four verses
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.780]   that you can summarize in this fashion,
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.860]   just using the text that's existent there.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.060]   Having confidence, having hope to visit,
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.500]   greetings from fellow workers, and closing grace.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   But, another way to see it is not just good wishes,
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.260]   or earlier when I started, I said,
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.500]   it's ending with just so much love and care, right?
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.460]   That I have this trust, I have this faith in you,
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.100]   but also the greetings of the brothers are with you.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.380]   Another way to look at it is,
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.180]   that each one of those things
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.820]   are even further added weight and motive and encouragement
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.100]   to do what he needs to do.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:44.540]   To do and carry out this gospel motivated desire to forgive.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.820]   And one is, yes, there is great trust, right?
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.860]   If I'm looking at someone like a coach saying,
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.620]   you know, I need you to take this last shot,
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.620]   to trust you, because already he's been trusted with much.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.860]   Already he's involved with ministry in so many ways.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.500]   And what's more, what motive, right?
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.980]   If let's say, you just imagine that you're a parent
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.380]   and you tell your children, you two,
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.860]   I need you to work this out.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.940]   I need you to talk to each other and get done.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.700]   I'm gonna check on you by the end of the day, okay?
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.740]   It's another form of motive.
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.780]   The witnesses around us, the fellow laborers and workers,
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.420]   isn't that another form of motive?
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.180]   And Christ's empowerment being the ultimate one,
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.980]   that Christ is the one working in your soul,
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.820]   producing the fruit.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.380]   Even if you feel like, I don't know if I can do it, right?
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.180]   There's too much anger and bitterness.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.300]   I don't know if I can reconcile with such and such person.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.220]   Ultimately, our true motive is gonna come
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:48.180]   from Christ being with us, right?
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.980]   How can I abide in the Lord when I don't do this, okay?
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.460]   So this is quick overview.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.940]   First portion, verse 21,
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:03.140]   let's talk about this idea of having confidence.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.140]   And I just mentioned again that, you know,
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:12.020]   one can imagine Apostle Paul talking like a coach, you know?
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.740]   Are we to imagine this portion just the same way
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.140]   we would imagine these epic movies?
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.180]   You know, it's the underdog, it's unlikely scenario,
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.860]   but there's this true belief that you can do it, you know?
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.020]   If we are we allowed to say those kinds of things,
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.460]   sometimes I wonder and think about that.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:37.660]   Or conversely, I think on a flip side of that,
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.340]   not just simply believing in somebody,
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:45.180]   but conversely, we sometimes, a lot of us are pessimists.
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.660]   That when we look at the natural way
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.860]   that people react to hard situations,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:54.420]   I think about instances where people have been at odds,
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.340]   think about instances where there's relationship strife.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.940]   Do we have a lot of pessimism that this could all work?
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.220]   And I think a lot about actually
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.500]   when people share about their families,
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.500]   especially if they're long held traditions in their family,
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.260]   deeply held cultural differences in the family,
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.820]   and then they'll tell me, yeah, that would never work, right?
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.460]   Because in your mind, you've already said,
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.420]   there's no hope for that.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.700]   Now, I don't wanna discount the things we know,
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.700]   the things we've experienced, and the things that, you know,
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:33.100]   that have been like the typical circumstances
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.940]   within our family, et cetera.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.260]   But what I'm talking about is,
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.260]   here, Apostle Paul is challenging Philemon to do something
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:46.540]   so that we don't forget, the chasm is huge.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.020]   The kind of chasm that you and I
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:53.380]   can't fully experience or empathize with
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:56.300]   if an individual is a master over somebody,
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.740]   and the person who has disrespected, offended,
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.860]   and then transgressed you is your slave, right?
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:07.180]   And so we began, actually, in the early portion
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:09.140]   of the overview of this book,
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.700]   this is truly, actually, an unlikely scenario.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.100]   In some sense, from a human standpoint,
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.700]   we would say an impossible scenario.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.460]   But rather than being pessimistic,
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.380]   Apostle Paul here is being not just optimistic,
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.580]   but hopeful, truly hopeful.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.740]   And what's more, something to observe within this passage
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.780]   is I find it strange that he's saying,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.700]   I am writing to you this lengthy letter,
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.100]   primarily because I have this confidence and hope in you.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.100]   Yes?
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.020]   Since I know that you will do even more.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.340]   Naturally, someone should be asking the question,
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.340]   wait a minute, if you have such confidence,
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:51.420]   such a heavy, like, dude, you're gonna be able to do this,
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.300]   and beyond even what I say, you're gonna be able to do it,
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.940]   then why would you even write this long, exhaustive,
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.480]   like, you know, 15-point letter, you know?
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.340]   What's really interesting about it, I think,
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.880]   is there is this operating principle within Scripture
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.740]   where even Jesus says to he who has already,
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.880]   more will be given.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.020]   But to him who doesn't have,
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.060]   even what he has will be taken away, right?
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.060]   And that strange principle is this idea,
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.300]   when an individual, their heart's already open
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.460]   to the blessings of God, not the earth's blessings,
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.700]   not his own plans, but the glories and the blessings of God,
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.460]   God tends to give more, more of his will,
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.820]   more of his good pleasure,
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:39.060]   more of the opportunities to experience his blessing.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.680]   Philemon, by taking these steps
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.180]   that Apostle Paul is going to say,
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.620]   is going to experience a kind of redemptive relationship,
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.060]   he's going to experience a different kind of fruitfulness
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.760]   in his life, and he's gonna be an inspiration
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.580]   to the brothers and sisters around him.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.780]   And God's gonna use him in ways
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.000]   that far exceed his expectation,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.200]   because he's gonna be used as a case example
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.540]   for all of us through time, right?
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:08.140]   And in that way, there's this idea of possibly,
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.340]   because of Philemon's already open heart
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.980]   and obedient heart, Apostle Paul is just laying more
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:18.700]   and more of his heart's wish and desire and wisdom.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.180]   A passage similar to that comes
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.580]   from 2 Corinthians chapter two,
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:24.940]   where Apostle Paul is talking to the church and says,
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.980]   "But I determined this for my own sake,
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:31.060]   "that I would not come to you in sorrow again,
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.320]   "for if I cause you sorrow, who then makes me glad
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.860]   "but the one whom I made sorrowful?
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.740]   "This is the very thing I wrote to you,
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.640]   "so that when I come, oh sorry, when I came,
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.080]   "I would not have sorrow from those
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.620]   "who ought to make me rejoice,
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:48.000]   "having confidence in you all,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.060]   "that my joy would be the joy of you all.
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.360]   "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart,
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.780]   "I wrote to you with many tears,
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.520]   "not so that you would be made sorrowful,
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:01.160]   "but that you might know the love
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.780]   "which I have especially for you."
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:08.060]   So, as I think and meditate about this very first verse
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.980]   that we looked at, I again wanna say,
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.180]   what I hear here when Apostle Paul is saying,
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.740]   I have such confidence in you,
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:17.580]   and then he lays on this thick instruction,
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:21.060]   lays on multiple reasons and argumentation,
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.380]   I realize, man, this book is all, not all,
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.340]   but has so much love and intentionality to it
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.580]   from all the different perspectives.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.980]   And that's what I'm gonna ask you later on to meditate on,
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.540]   is we have different perspectives of,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.940]   and directions in which love should go, okay?
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:45.700]   All right, and then so, next we have,
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:51.100]   verse 22, he says here,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.460]   "At the same time, also prepare me a lodging,
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.500]   "for I hope that through your prayers,
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:00.020]   "I will be given to you."
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.560]   One, as an extension of verse 21,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.160]   think about how much just love and care,
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.480]   as a theme that I mentioned throughout the study,
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.280]   I said, man, as an individual that kinda has struggled
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.260]   to retain relationships since I was young,
[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.960]   I don't know about some of you guys,
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   but if, when I went from high school to college,
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.280]   a lot of those relationships were lost.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   Now, I had become Christian
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.680]   at the end of that high school season.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.720]   When I went from college to young adult life,
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.600]   just because of change of stage of life,
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.480]   a lot of those relationships were lost, right?
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.380]   And then, when life gets really busy,
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.560]   and then you start having children,
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.440]   and more things gets added to your plate,
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.240]   actually your pool of friends just start to shrink, yeah?
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.280]   Apostle Paul, I keep telling myself, the guy is human.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   He's not a machine, and he's not like the Holy Spirit
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.000]   that's everywhere, right?
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.480]   But clearly, because of the burden of love on his heart,
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.720]   even while he's in prison, he's writing,
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.400]   he's thinking, he's considering,
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   and even to this very precise, I guess you can say,
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.780]   not just precise, but intimate level
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.320]   of two individuals within the church,
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.200]   he still has that kinda care.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.680]   So that's an extension of that.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.440]   But the other part is, his longing and desire
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.360]   to see people face to face, in an age and generation
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.760]   when that kind of travel is difficult, that's inspiring.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.600]   Why?
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.680]   For us, in an age and generation where we can hop
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:32.920]   in our car, drive to someone's house in 15 minutes,
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.640]   a lot of us prefer to be distant.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.840]   We prefer, you just text me what you need, right?
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.520]   Just email me, let's get on a phone call,
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.840]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.120]   It's funny how that works, right?
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.560]   Kind of ironic that we have now such an ability to connect,
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.920]   but then nowadays when people say, oh yeah,
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.720]   we have great, great privileges to connect with one another,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.880]   and the way that we're thinking about it is online, right?
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.040]   To him, the letter was not enough.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.440]   Messages from friends was not enough.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.040]   Reports from his fellow workers was not enough.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.520]   He had his heart to visit, okay?
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.360]   Next.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:17.520]   In verse 23 to 24, here we have this interesting passage
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.680]   with the various individuals, right?
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.720]   So, in my mind I was thinking, part of the reason
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.880]   why I highlighted the people hugging each other
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.800]   in the first thing was, as you guys know,
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:36.920]   our hope and prayer at our church is that you, primarily,
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.640]   signed off on a membership covenant
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.680]   that you would be the carrier of the gospel
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.760]   and that you would be the light to the world, yes?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.460]   You are going to be the carrier of the gospel
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.440]   to your coworkers and you're going to be the carrier
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   of the gospel to your family, your classmates, et cetera.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.560]   You as individuals, we are all individual members
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.360]   doing the work of ministry, okay?
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.480]   And then by doing that, you're the inspiration
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.520]   that shows other members it can be done, yes?
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.920]   Our church, a lot of times, will have our leadership meeting
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:14.040]   and will say, guys, how many times have we actually done
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.520]   prayer seminars, evangelism seminars, and teaching sessions?
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.400]   A lot.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.240]   Do we need another one to motivate people to move?
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.720]   And the answer is, sometimes, no.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.040]   We need to just take people with us.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.660]   We need to just show you how it's done,
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.360]   what to do in certain scenarios,
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.280]   and just simply getting over the hump
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.060]   that it can be done is the biggest part of the game, right?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.880]   But likewise in this, where Apostle Paul
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   is challenging Philemon to forgive, to reconcile,
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.520]   and more specifically in the book, to accept, yeah?
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.080]   What's really interesting is, number one,
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.880]   Epaphras, as you guys, if you search him up,
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.640]   his name comes up several times in the book of Colossians.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.440]   So Philemon and Epaphras probably
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.480]   know each other quite well, right?
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.360]   Because they're laboring in the same arena,
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.280]   they're both faithful servants of the kingdom,
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.920]   and so for Philemon, what a big weight of accountability.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.560]   It's like, okay, Apostle Paul mentioned
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.680]   the guy that I work with.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.800]   That is that kind of feeling almost, right?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.440]   But what's more, you see this name, Mark.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.360]   The individual Mark has a strange
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.320]   and interesting relationship with the Apostle Paul.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.280]   As a matter of fact, actually, the person Mark
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.840]   has both kind of comedic and funny instances
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.800]   throughout the Gospels even.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.940]   It may not be the exact same individual,
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.680]   but in the Gospel of Mark, it records an individual
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.880]   who, at the face of persecution, ran away naked.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.280]   A lot of people think it was Mark.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.120]   Why?
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.380]   Because there were other instances
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.800]   when in the face of persecution,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.960]   when time got hard, Mark ran away.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.520]   I just pick a bad name, okay?
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.880]   The story goes that Apostle Paul,
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.680]   on his missionary journey, had Mark follow
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.240]   when Apostle Paul took Barnabas
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.840]   because Mark was Barnabas' cousin.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:17.160]   When times got tough, Mark actually abandoned the two
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.100]   and went back to Jerusalem.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.400]   The second missionary journey, Apostle Paul says,
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.460]   "We're not taking Mark."
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.840]   Barnabas is like, "No, we should.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.880]   "He can be helpful."
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.880]   And the two actually fight over Mark so much so,
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.760]   Barnabas and Paul had to go separate ways.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.220]   Mark was a source of contention, yeah?
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:37.800]   So then what's really interesting about this story is,
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.560]   Apostle Paul is challenging Philemon,
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.560]   but Paul himself experienced being separated for some time,
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.900]   but later to have Mark come back and become useful.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:52.080]   Thankfully, later in the letter of 2 Timothy,
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.560]   Apostle Paul actually requests Mark to come.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.540]   Why?
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:59.120]   Because Mark proved himself to be useful.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.960]   Yes, okay?
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.480]   Redemption, right?
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.680]   Mark proved himself to be useful.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.420]   So, you think about this then, all of these guys,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.600]   they've actually either been imprisoned
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.620]   with Apostle Paul, right?
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.360]   You look at the book of Acts and these individuals,
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.440]   when there was a riot in Ephesus,
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.440]   they got arrested with Apostle Paul.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.240]   These individuals all went through the various lumps
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.880]   and bruises of ministry.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:31.720]   And through that, even, yes, betrayal, yes, abandonment,
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.740]   Apostle Paul is gonna say persevere,
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.680]   and then this cloud of witnesses, I believe,
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.680]   is a huge indirect source of an encouragement to Philemon.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.440]   We're all in this doing God's work together.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.940]   And so, finally, there is the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.560]   be with your spirit as the encouragement to do all things,
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.560]   which is, I remember this idea that in order, obviously,
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:05.160]   to abide with Christ and to dwell with him in such a way,
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:10.160]   there can never be this quieting of the conscience, right?
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.000]   And so this I wanna give as an encouragement
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.480]   and also challenge to say, for us, intimacy with Christ
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.120]   and the ability to walk with him daily
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.280]   is the precious price, right?
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.780]   Nothing else is supposed to be as rewarding, fulfilling,
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:32.440]   and secure and hopeful as abiding in Christ, yes?
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:37.240]   However, if we ever, and if any of you guys
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.840]   are struggling with reconciling with someone in the church,
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.040]   someone who's a fellow believer,
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.440]   if you ever quiet the conviction and say,
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.400]   I'm just gonna not talk to this person,
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.560]   I'm just gonna cross different sides of the road,
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.760]   et cetera, et cetera, there is no way
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.640]   that kind of intimacy and daily walking with Christ
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.620]   is going to happen.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.880]   Treasure that so much that you will not let
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.800]   that temptation reside, amen?
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.240]   Okay, so then I wanna do review with you guys
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.080]   that in this last portion, then potentially,
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.120]   Apostle Paul added several various layers of persuasion
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.640]   as to why Philemon needed to accept
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.720]   and forgive and reconcile with Onesimus.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:26.320]   As a summary and review of the letter, okay?
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.520]   Verses one through two was Apostle Paul,
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.360]   you know, greetings with Timothy
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.680]   and then addressing various people in the church,
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.920]   and then verse three through seven
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.840]   was the first major significant section
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.040]   highlighting encouragement, appreciation,
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.680]   and prayer for Philemon, okay?
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.520]   So, bum-ba-da-bum, 10 points
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.020]   for whoever can fill in the blank, okay?
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.300]   I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:03.600]   okay, I see a person, Danielle,
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.100]   why don't you say it out loud?
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.780]   Okay, sorry.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.940]   What?
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:14.740]   Effective, good job, 10 points.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.820]   (laughing)
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.900]   Oh, nice, nice, okay.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.260]   And the reason why we say this is because
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:24.620]   if you're thinking of like kinda key verse,
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:28.180]   that was the first way when I did my overview study
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.060]   through the book of Philemon.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.740]   Apostle Paul desires, Jesus Christ desires,
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.620]   God desires our faith to be effective,
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.460]   and what more empowerment than for us
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.600]   who has received forgiveness, right,
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.620]   to put into effect the kind of mercy that we received?
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.860]   So if you actually think about it,
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.380]   one of the ways that I was thinking about this book was
[01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.580]   Onesimus, his faith needs to have an effect
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:55.580]   in his repentance and walk, right?
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.140]   Philemon, he has to exercise his faith
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.980]   in the acceptance of a repentant sinner.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.320]   Apostle Paul is exercising his faith
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.500]   essentially being a Christ-like figure
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.300]   of one who is, remember, an advocate,
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.180]   remember, a payer, a person who carries the burden
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.500]   of somebody else's sin on his back.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.140]   This book is about actually effective faith,
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:19.100]   and that was the prayer that Philemon gave,
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:23.380]   I mean, sorry, Apostle Paul gave for Philemon, okay?
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.500]   And so in the encouragement,
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.100]   in the encouragement and affirmation of Philemon,
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.140]   he was saying, you are actually already effective.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:35.980]   You're giving me joy, your love for all the saints,
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.340]   and Jesus Christ is already told.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.620]   And then it says, the hearts of the saints have been,
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.660]   blank, through you, brother.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:50.820]   Refreshed, excellent, okay, 10 points for you guys, right?
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:54.060]   That the people were refreshed already by the faith,
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.860]   and one of the things I highlighted and challenged to you,
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.220]   that is a different mentality.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:02.460]   As a point of challenge to you guys and for me,
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.900]   it's one thing to ask, what does the Lord require of me?
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.100]   It's another thing to ask, what is the Lord refreshed by?
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.260]   And it is okay for us,
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.340]   even when we think about people in our lives,
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:17.220]   people who are our bosses, your parents, your friends,
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.920]   people who rely on you.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.820]   It is a different question to ask,
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:24.700]   wait, what's fair of you to expect of me?
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.200]   Is that too much pressure?
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.140]   Versus you thinking, how can I refresh you, yes?
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.740]   All right, refreshed, next.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:35.320]   So in this first half, what you have is there's greeting,
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.060]   there's encouragement, and then Apostle Paul explaining
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:43.580]   why this appeal is coming to Philemon in this way.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:48.020]   And so, in verses eight through 10, he starts to describe,
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:51.120]   you know, I do have confidence in Christ,
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.300]   just to order you to do what's right,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:58.040]   but for blank blank, I rather appeal to you.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:02.160]   Two words, for 20 points.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.600]   Someone in the back, raise your hand.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.360]   Yes.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.140]   Marta.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.840]   Excellent, for love's sake, I rather appeal to you, okay?
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.360]   And so in this way, if you were to do like a summary
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.400]   of this book, I do think, yeah, you know,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.000]   this book actually is one of the more lovely,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.200]   it's not necessarily correcting like,
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.300]   oh, you've got the sin of lust and the flesh
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.000]   and the worldliness, right?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.520]   This is actually like, I want you to go above and beyond
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.860]   to really know what it means to love deeply.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.780]   And Apostle Paul's love for both parties shines,
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.020]   doesn't it?
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:46.060]   I almost keep thinking like, this is not a normal person,
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.080]   right?
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:50.900]   The kind of love that a person has for another individual
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:55.220]   to just, like in such endearing fashion,
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.220]   one person who's a grown adult to love another person
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.020]   who's a grown adult in that way, okay?
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:05.940]   And then there was the theme that this love
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.180]   is not going to be of compulsion,
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.780]   but it's gonna be consenting,
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:13.200]   it's gonna be of its own goodness and free will.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.740]   Next, in the second half, now it goes boom, boom, boom,
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.420]   boom, boom, and the persuasions get listed off,
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.180]   and he starts talking about just the weight of his character
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.580]   that he's now the age, the prisoner of Christ,
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:27.460]   and then he highlights Onesimus,
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.580]   bum, ba-da-bum, for 40 points,
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.620]   'cause there's four blanks.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.220]   It says, "I appeal to you for my blank, Onesimus,
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.240]   "whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:41.100]   "who formerly was blank."
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.520]   Okay, wait, wait, who wants to raise their hand and do it?
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.500]   Yes, go for it.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500]   - My son, useless to you,
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:54.680]   now he's useful, and very hard.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.580]   - And very hard, excellent.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.860]   I'm gonna give you 3.5,
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.020]   'cause the NASB translation says child.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.260]   (laughing)
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.380]   Good job, good job.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.940]   Okay, so when we think about this passage,
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.860]   and he starts talking about his child,
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:16.280]   I just really feel like, again,
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.760]   I think I mentioned in the lesson
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.080]   that it's not commonplace for us
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.800]   to talk about other people as useful,
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.740]   and then for that to sound really encouraging.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.620]   But remember, the way that Apostle Paul
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.800]   was loving on Onesimus was to say,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.420]   not just like, oh, yeah, yeah,
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.340]   before he was just this useless, just dead weight,
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.300]   but now we can use him for something.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.340]   Remember, Apostle Paul's saying that was to say,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:42.660]   actually, I want to keep him, right?
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:45.460]   That his heart was to have him with him,
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.380]   and that was his heart,
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:50.160]   and in that way, his heart was pure in what he was doing.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.800]   It's not as though he's sending him off,
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.020]   like, it's not my problem, it's your problem, right?
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.260]   He was saying, no, I want you to keep Onesimus.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:01.400]   Okay, so then, he started to talk about Onesimus
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.400]   in this way, and then he talked about, in verse 14,
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.720]   again, that this has to be of your own free will,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.880]   so I don't want to do anything without your consent,
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.520]   and then he pointed Philemon's eyes and says,
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.120]   why you need to accept him is because
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.640]   you see there are greater results at hand, primarily,
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.000]   because you need to understand how God is working, right?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.820]   One of the primary things that needs to happen in our mind
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:31.800]   to overcome our flesh and to overcome our calculating,
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.780]   our predictive and self-defensive ways
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:38.080]   is to always look out and see, how is God working?
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.700]   That as much as this is gonna cost me, burden me,
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:44.660]   and be an inconvenience to me, my God's sovereign in this.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.180]   And it's gonna empower us to do things
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.980]   like accepting a whole individual, right?
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.580]   So then, he says, in verse 16, no longer a slave,
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.620]   but more than a slave, eh, blank, blank,
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.060]   and everybody said?
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:01.760]   Beloved brother, amen.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.500]   Okay, so when we think about that,
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.540]   I thought that was so beautiful, the contrast,
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:09.600]   when he said, you know, he was separated,
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.000]   but now you have him back forever.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.100]   And the contrast is, he was a slave,
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.900]   but now he's a beloved brother.
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:18.860]   You have a connection that you did not have before,
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.960]   and it's not just minor.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.180]   It makes entirety, the entirety of difference.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.940]   We believe that when, let's say right now,
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.080]   there's a whole lot of like cultural divide,
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.260]   there's a whole lot of political divide,
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:38.260]   ideological divide, divide on agenda, all this stuff, right?
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:42.140]   We believe as Christians, yes, we can talk it out,
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.140]   hash it out, and we can talk about which system is better,
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:47.820]   which ideology is proven to be more effective,
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.180]   all that stuff, but that will never produce
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.380]   what we're hoping for, because what we're hoping for
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.900]   is true unity, and that can only come in Christ,
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.940]   in Christ's redemption, amen?
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.640]   So, in wrapping things up, from this,
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.500]   Apostle Paul just goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.380]   and he starts talking about, I want you to see him
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.260]   like you see me, right?
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.980]   Accept him as you would me, and then he starts saying,
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.140]   I'll pay for it, you know, I'll,
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.660]   if he has, owes you anything, I'll pay,
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.480]   and he looks it over at Philemon and says,
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.980]   but remember also, I'm not gonna say it,
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:26.460]   but I'm saying now, you owe me your life, right?
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.740]   It's crazy, and then, in verse 20, he says,
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.380]   refresh my heart, let me benefit from you,
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:34.340]   and then, with what we studied today,
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.860]   I have confidence that you could do even more,
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:39.140]   and I'll be visiting, just to check.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:41.460]   I'm just kidding, I don't think that he said it that way,
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.740]   but he said, I'm coming, right?
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.940]   He said, I'm gonna be coming to you,
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.860]   and I really wanna be with you,
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.780]   and he points to, look at all the fellow workers,
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.980]   suffering alongside you, right?
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:53.500]   Bearing the burdens of loving the flock,
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.100]   and Philemon was already entrusted,
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:58.540]   he has a flock in his house, and it was so necessary,
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:01.940]   it was so necessary for Philemon to exercise
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:05.240]   this case point, you know?
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.640]   Object lesson of the gospel, to receive a repentant sinner,
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.800]   who humbly came with a letter, right?
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.080]   If Philemon could embrace and accept him,
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.760]   what a beautiful show of the redemptive work
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.700]   that Christ can do, amen?
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.360]   Okay, so, by way of conclusion,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.840]   one of the things I do want you to meditate on
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.760]   is think about the effectiveness of faith in this.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.300]   It all comes from faith.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.980]   It doesn't come from Philemon's, just like,
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.180]   know-how, ingenuity, and the fact that he happens
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.760]   to be a wealthy individual.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   No, we know it comes from his faith,
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.520]   and it's been evident because he's a loving man.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.120]   He loves everyone.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.720]   And so, a couple things I have asked,
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.720]   or I want you to meditate on is,
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.800]   think about the fruit and effectiveness of faith
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.080]   that's required of the sinning party,
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.440]   an example that Anissa showed.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.280]   I think, sometimes, we don't seek repentance enough
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:02.700]   to have the kind of reconciliation the Bible talks about.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   God is not okay with, "I'm sorry, it's okay."
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.440]   God's not satisfied with that.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:17.200]   God wants people to be washed with repentance.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.440]   I see my sins, I see how it hurts you,
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.620]   I see how it offends God, I see how there's a better way.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:25.560]   There should be thorough repentance, why?
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:29.060]   Because godly sorrow brings washing.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:33.120]   It leads us to a repentant heart, and then change.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.880]   And then, so this person is not saying, "It's all right."
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.200]   I mean, what's all right?
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.720]   What Anissa did is not okay.
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.500]   Why do we say that?
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.800]   What they should be saying,
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.840]   "I forgive and accept you in Christ."
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.240]   Come here, and then, you know,
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:53.040]   there should be a lot more hugging, and all that stuff.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.480]   The fruit of faith for the offended party for Philemon,
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.280]   and then the fruit of faith as the peacemaker, Apostle Paul.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.360]   Look at what he did, really risked it.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.640]   Risked a lot, actually.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.920]   He could have ended up losing two friends, right?
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:12.220]   Ended up losing both Anissamus and Philemon in some sense.
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.920]   But he took the risk to put his name on there
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:19.920]   to be an advocate and a sacrificial party in this mediation.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.840]   That's pretty inspiring, okay?
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.120]   So, I hope that for Philemon,
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.000]   you guys have some good verses to think through.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.440]   And then, a theme as one book that's short,
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.360]   but chock full of the love of Christ.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.180]   Let's pray.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:41.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.720]   We recognize, God, Lord,
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.560]   that by the inspiration of your grace,
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.120]   you have written this out for us to all see.
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.760]   Lord, we recognize that some of the most painful things
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.560]   that happen to us, actually, is not just physical,
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.620]   but it is when there is broken relationships
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.460]   because of sin.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:04.320]   We pray, Father God, that we would see this as a microcosm,
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.560]   that the Lord of the universe
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.280]   desire to reconcile mankind to himself
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.920]   and pay the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.040]   I pray, Father God, that as we are a people
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:19.240]   who have seen this glory, this beauty,
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.900]   help us, Lord, to be empowered by the gospel,
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:26.200]   to exercise a kind of love that truly is
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.700]   beyond just human capacity and out of this world.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:30.740]   We wanna thank you.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.900]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.800]   Okay, the final thing I just wanna say is,
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.020]   just so that the small group leaders,
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.300]   the discussion facilitators don't forget,
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:47.160]   next week, 6.30 is facilitators meeting here in the cafe.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.660]   Once again, for the BAM members,
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.660]   today is the last day to sign up
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.000]   because we have to make groups
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.660]   and there's limited house locations to meet at,
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:58.020]   so sign up for that.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.880]   And then, sign up for Galatians, okay?
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   This QR code we have on a stand sign
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.320]   there at the entrance
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.760]   and at the entrance of the cry room as well.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.460]   But right now, you can take a look,
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.500]   tap on that, and sign up.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.760]   We are also gonna send an email reminder
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:19.040]   and then post it up on Facebook just momentarily.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.520]   Okay?
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.940]   Okay, then, just for post-discussion,
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.800]   you know, what perspective or motive
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.280]   helps us seek reconciliation in the church?
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.160]   Maybe another way to ask it is,
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.980]   what's the stop block in our mind
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.920]   and what perspective has to change
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.520]   in order for us, right, to seek reconciliation?
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.760]   Number two, it's the one I asked earlier,
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.400]   what are some takeaway convictions
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:48.020]   from the vantage point of the key figures?
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:50.120]   Okay, so I'm not gonna read that all again.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.520]   And then number three, review what are the key verses
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.080]   and the specific themes that stand out and convict you
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.960]   now that we've done, finished the study of the book, okay?
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.640]   And then, if you finish early,
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.960]   please just share prayer requests and pray for each other.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.320]   All right, thanks everyone.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:08.400]   (audience applauding)
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:18.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
