[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.440]   - Good morning.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.900]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.720]   We have actually a lot of things
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.800]   that are going on pretty soon.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.320]   But first of all, we wanna remind you
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.040]   that our VBS is taking place this week.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   And so after the Old Testament survey class,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.800]   they're going to be clearing out everything
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.280]   and preparing the whole sanctuary
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.920]   and the whole church for the VBS.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.840]   And so the volunteers will be sticking around
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.080]   doing all of that stuff.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.960]   And so again, for the parents,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.560]   again, starting from tomorrow at five o'clock
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.980]   and try to bring the children a little bit earlier
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.240]   so that they can be registered and into small groups
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.040]   and situated before they get into their classes.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.520]   And so that's starting tomorrow all the way to Friday.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   Okay, so just keep that in mind.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.760]   And then another thing is our retreat
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   that's coming up in August.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.780]   Typically, we have a live service here.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.960]   We have a guest speaker that comes
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.400]   or one of our pastors will come in
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.680]   and lead a live service.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.840]   But this year, we have almost full attendance.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.960]   And so we're not able to run a service here
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.720]   because then a bunch of people
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.560]   would have to come back from the retreat.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.800]   And so, well, I was told we have about 640 people
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.640]   who are in attendance for the retreat.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.560]   And so that's pretty much most of the people
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.680]   who are here at church.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.960]   But we will be having live stream.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.120]   So the service that we're having at the retreat
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.960]   will be live stream.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.480]   So for whatever reason that you cannot,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.000]   and those of you who are online,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.920]   live stream will still happen.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.800]   But again, there will not be a live service here,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.200]   physical service here.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.920]   And if you choose to, you can come
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.720]   and join us for the physical service where we're at.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.120]   And we'll give the address for that.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.200]   But those of you who cannot come,
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.600]   there will be live stream on that Sunday.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.160]   So we'll remind you of that as we get closer to that date.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.440]   And then our new session of Bible study
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.120]   is gonna be starting in September.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.720]   And so if you haven't registered for that,
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   whether you're in home group or small group,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.960]   we will be having the physical home, small group,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.560]   that we've been online all this time
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.040]   because of obviously what's going on.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.760]   But starting from our next session in September,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.360]   we will have a live session here.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.320]   So there will be no online.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.540]   It will be all live on Wednesdays,
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.980]   and then the home groups as well.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.120]   So if you have not signed up for that,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.960]   please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.560]   And to better prepare for that,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.360]   our inductive Bible study,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.600]   Pastor Mark is leading a inductive Bible study,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.460]   how to do Bible study lab.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.920]   And that's gonna be taking place August 1st, 8th, and 22nd.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.040]   So please sign up for that,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.160]   and then he'll help you guide through
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.760]   how to study the Bible.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.600]   And then that is, I would say it's a must.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.140]   If you haven't done that kind of study before,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.240]   I would highly recommend you take that class,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.480]   and then he will help you so that
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.360]   when you take the class in September,
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.600]   you'll be able to follow along with that, okay?
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.040]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.880]   please sign up for that.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.840]   And the first session is happening on August 1st for that,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.420]   and then regular Bible study in September.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.860]   Next week, we have a members meeting
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.380]   that's taking place at 2.30 p.m.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.200]   So if you are a member, or you're becoming a member,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.360]   it is, again, a quarterly mandatory meeting.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.420]   So if you cannot make it,
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.460]   please let us know ahead of time.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.540]   And that is gonna be at 2.30,
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.980]   so it'll give you just enough time to go grab lunch
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.620]   and then come back.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.780]   At that members meeting,
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.420]   we will introduce our new members to the church,
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.820]   and we have a big service fair,
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.860]   meaning that all the different departments
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.980]   and people who are serving
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.860]   and committees that are gonna be set up,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.820]   so whether it's elementary or the parking team.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.180]   So you'll be able to walk around
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.060]   and see what's going on in the church.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.260]   And so some of those groups are recruiting.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.640]   They need help, so they'll probably have a sign-up table
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.660]   where you can sign your name,
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.440]   and you can sign up for six months to a year to do that.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.600]   And then there are some tables
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.140]   that's just for your information
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.380]   so that you can know what's going on inside the church.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.140]   So next Sunday, you'll see right after the second service,
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.740]   you'll have all these booths that are gonna be set up,
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.100]   and so before and after the members meeting,
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.300]   you can go visit those places.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.420]   I think, well, maybe after the members meeting,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.900]   you can go visit and then sign up for that.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.780]   So that's taking place next Sunday.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.860]   So if you have any questions about how can I jump in,
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.180]   how can I get involved, how can I serve the church,
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.860]   next Sunday service fair is for that purpose, okay?
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.920]   And along with that, just a reminder,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.580]   the cafe night is happening at the end of this month
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.620]   and at 7.30 on Saturday.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.100]   And so they've already had an EV outing yesterday.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.540]   There's another one happening today,
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.660]   and then another big event happening on the 24th
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.620]   next Saturday, and all of this is to, again,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.140]   just to encourage the church to go to do evangelism.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.180]   And so if you haven't signed up and you wanna sign up,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.940]   you can do that for next Saturday,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.780]   and they're gonna be, I think, at the UTC Center to do that.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.940]   And then if you sign up, they'll give you more information
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.740]   about where to meet and that type of stuff.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.860]   And then if you have people that you'd want to invite,
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.980]   again, that's what this is for.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.620]   This is at the minimum so you can pray,
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   but the other part of it is so you can invite people
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.380]   to come to that and just let our outreach team know
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.700]   that's, again, being led by our brother, June,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.180]   and so let him know so that they can better pray
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.420]   and prepare for that night, okay?
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.180]   All right, so it's a lot of announcements.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.940]   Okay, and just one other reminder,
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.940]   as we prepare for the offering,
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.020]   and I wanna remind you again that we're trying
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.020]   to transition from Venmo to PayPal and Zelle,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.300]   so if you're able to pay your offering through Zelle
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.900]   or PayPal to use that instead of Venmo.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   So if Venmo's the only avenue you have,
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.900]   then the church can receive that,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.740]   but we're having some issues with Venmo,
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.140]   so if possible, we wanna encourage you guys
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.820]   to use the other avenues first.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.520]   And those of you who are still using physical checks
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.220]   and you're writing with pen and paper,
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.980]   our offering basket is in the back
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   so you can drop it off there, all right?
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.900]   (laughing)
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.020]   You know who I'm talking about, all right.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.100]   All right, so I'm gonna take a minute to pray
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.180]   and then we'll give you the opportunity
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.340]   to give the offering before we enter
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.100]   into their main praise, let's pray.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.780]   Heavenly Father, we're so grateful and thankful,
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.720]   Lord God, that your mercy and grace
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.900]   has allowed us to come to worship you.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.480]   I pray, Father God, that whatever we are entangled with,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:10.380]   the distraction, Lord God, that we so easily give into,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.700]   help us each Sunday morning as we come together
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.400]   that we would have a greater sense of your glory,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   that we would be transformed from one glory to another.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.020]   I pray that what you have invested in your word
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.060]   would cause us, Lord God, to worship you
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.520]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   And even in our giving this morning,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.940]   I pray that you would help us to give it to you
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.940]   meaningfully, intentionally, generously,
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.660]   joyfully, Lord God, that it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.160]   We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.180]   (gentle piano music)
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.260]   (gentle piano music)

[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:51.300]   Let us all rise as we sing these praises.

[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.220]   (upbeat music)

[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:19.740]   - All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.740]   to Hebrews chapter 12, we're gonna be in part two
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.960]   of what we started last week.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.600]   It looks like we're gonna have another part next week.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.260]   Okay.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.260]   All right, Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 through 24.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.160]   Again, reading out of the NASB.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.940]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.460]   and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.780]   and whirlwind, and to the blast of a trumpet
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.460]   and the sound of words, which sound was such
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.940]   that those who heard begged that no further word
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.580]   be spoken to them.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.220]   For they could not bear the command,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.340]   if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.580]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.800]   "I am full of fear and trembling."
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.340]   But you have come to Mount Zion
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.900]   and to the city of the living God,
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.780]   to heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.220]   to the general assembly and church of the firstborn
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.660]   who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all,
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.460]   and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.680]   and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.340]   and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.740]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.560]   Let's pray.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:40.240]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would help us and guide us.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.460]   May your word take center stage.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.400]   Protect this pulpit, Lord God,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.940]   that your sheep will hear your voice
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.900]   and follow you and you alone.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.420]   You know, I've shared with you many times
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.660]   that I started ministry probably earlier than I should have.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.860]   At age 19, my former discipler, you know,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.700]   he encouraged me to go to this church.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.940]   His friend was planting a church,
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.020]   and why don't you go help out?
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.180]   And so I became a youth pastor at 19,
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.180]   just out of, again, just to be obedient to my discipler,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.940]   and then I've been in ministry since.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.940]   And there's a lot of things that I did
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.460]   as a young youth pastor.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.300]   You know, I was a youth pastor,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.020]   I think, from 19 to about 24, 25,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.740]   and then I went to the college ministry,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.940]   and then after that, the young adults,
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.660]   and then we ended up planting this church.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.820]   But there's a lot of things that I did early on
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:38.580]   that I probably would not do now, right?
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.780]   And one of the things that I remember very distinctly
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:46.780]   was I got a cassette tape.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.540]   Those of you guys remember what cassette tapes are?
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.380]   And in the tape, basically, it was a recording
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.140]   of a demonic encounter that this live radio program guy
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.140]   was having, and so he wanted me to listen to it.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.180]   And so I listened to it, and I said,
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.900]   "Oh, it was very shocking."
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.780]   And so I thought, "Oh, this would be a good idea
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.100]   "to let the kids listen to it."
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.580]   And so I remember Elder Joe was also in the youth group
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.820]   at that time, so I think he's the only one.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.800]   You were there, right?
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.020]   Yeah, he was there, so he was one of the guys
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.140]   who got traumatized that day.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.400]   So it just happened, the night that I was playing
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.120]   that audio, it was raining and thundering,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.540]   and it was up in the darker part of the church,
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.460]   Irvine Baptist, that I was at.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.940]   And then, basically, the recording is,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.700]   it was kind of like that live Bible program,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.180]   but Bible Answer Man, and so people would just
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.460]   randomly call in and ask questions.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.060]   And so this young girl, I think she said
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.620]   she was maybe like 15 or 16 years old,
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.820]   she called, and she seemed so disoriented.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.740]   And you could tell that in the beginning,
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.780]   they didn't know how to deal with her,
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.560]   and she said, "I don't know why I called.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.260]   "I just pulled over, and something led me to call,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.100]   "and I'm not exactly sure where I'm calling.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.940]   "What is this?"
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.420]   And so, in the beginning, it sounds like a prank call.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.100]   But as they are having this conversation,
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.460]   she started to say things like how she was raised
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.300]   in a satanic home, and that her whole upbringing
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.740]   was to prepare her for this particular sacrifice.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.060]   And so, initially, it sounded like, "Is this a prank call?"
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.340]   And again, this is all recording live on the radio,
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.620]   and you could tell back and forth
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.140]   that even the hosts are kind of caught off guard,
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.140]   not to know how to deal with her.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.820]   And so they started to share the gospel with her,
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.660]   and then she said, when he mentioned the name Jesus,
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.080]   her response was shocking, because she said,
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.620]   "Who is this Jesus, this man?
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.460]   "Does he want to have sexual relations with me?"
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.960]   And obviously, it's blasphemous what she was saying,
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.740]   but the radio hosts just caught off guard,
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.220]   and she said that's the only thing that she knew,
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.100]   so ever since she was a child,
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.860]   that this happened to her repeatedly,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.740]   and all of this, supposedly, was to prepare her
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.140]   for some sacrifice that they were gonna make.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.740]   Well, you can tell that the radio host
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.980]   is also kind of trying to figure this out.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.940]   Is this real?
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.820]   Is this a prank call?
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.500]   And in the middle of sharing the gospel with her,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.580]   this is on live radio, her voice changes
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.860]   into a demonic voice, and there's dead silence
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.380]   for about 10 seconds, because you could tell
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.220]   the hosts were trying to figure out, is this real or not?
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.520]   And then the demon begins to speak,
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.500]   and so the recording is that encounter that they have,
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.360]   and this was recorded.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.580]   So I didn't even listen to the whole thing.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.980]   I just thought this was pretty shocking,
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.580]   and it's just that, in my wisdom,
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.940]   I thought this would be great for our youth group.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.940]   And at that time, I think Officer Joe
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.060]   was probably 13, 14 at that time?
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:47.940]   Yeah, something about that.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.700]   So we had children as young as 12,
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.120]   maybe even younger, all the way up to 18,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.660]   and at the end of the recording,
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.940]   it was maybe about a 10, 15-minute recording,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.820]   at the end of it, they actually said when this happened,
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.740]   and it just happened to be exactly that same day,
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:07.740]   two years before, and it was two weeks before Halloween,
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.620]   that she was being prepared as a sacrifice,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.860]   if all this is true.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.180]   And so obviously, the kids were in shock.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.540]   Even I was in shock, and then thunder started to happen,
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.820]   and the rain started falling,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.040]   and then people were scared to death,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.500]   and then it just happened that night,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.980]   we were introducing Friday night prayer meetings,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.340]   and so we had 110% attendance,
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.900]   and people were crying out to God.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.580]   It was a great way to start the prayer meeting,
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.220]   'cause people were scared.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.420]   And the reason why I say
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.200]   I probably would not have done that again,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.100]   because I found out way later
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.460]   that some of the younger girls were so scared
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.180]   that they couldn't sleep at night for months,
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.560]   and they didn't even tell me this until way later
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.000]   that they couldn't even wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.120]   because they were so scared of what they heard.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.700]   Now, I tell you all of this,
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.560]   not to say like, oh, the Demers are real.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.120]   Of course the Demons are real, right?
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.520]   But the purpose of this story, to tell you the story,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.840]   isn't that like, was that a prank, was that real?
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.360]   But that's not really my point, right?
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.680]   It seemed very real, but the point of my story is,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.760]   whenever we hear stories of demonic encounters,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.680]   whether it's here or overseas,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.520]   our immediate response is fear, right?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.960]   But is that fear based upon what we've learned in Scripture,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.600]   or is that fear based upon what we've been conditioned
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.180]   to think because of media?
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.920]   Now, I personally don't think Christians watching
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.180]   scary movies is a good idea, right?
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.580]   Because your frame of work of the spiritual world
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.400]   is being framed by the world.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.120]   And so whatever you feel, instinctively,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.040]   may be coming from you being exposed to certain things
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.440]   that is not biblical.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.560]   And I think in a large capacity that this intense fear
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.480]   that people have of the spiritual encounter
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.440]   is not dictated by what we see in Scripture.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.120]   It's by the world.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.820]   And yet on the flip side,
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.140]   whenever we talk about encountering God,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.500]   we talk about it so flippantly.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.420]   God spoke to me, I went to God, I went to his presence.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.860]   And not to say that none of that is true or it's wrong,
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.020]   but typically when we talk about God and his presence,
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.120]   there is no fear that's instilled.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.560]   We think of God as this holy grandfather
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.180]   that passes out candy.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.660]   And he, of course he doesn't like sin,
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.200]   but he just kind of brushes it off.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.720]   So, oh, my son died for you, cover for you.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.460]   And then we live by these cliches.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.440]   And so whenever we talk about the presence of God,
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.940]   there's no fear at all.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.540]   Just warm, fuzzy feelings.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.700]   And yet when we talk about Satan,
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.400]   there's this trembling that is inconsistent
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.360]   with what we see in Scripture.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.480]   Until we have a proper view of who God is,
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.300]   other fears are always going to dominate us.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:12.300]   In fact, I believe some of the greatest heresies
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.800]   that creeps into the church is coming through men
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.500]   who are more fearful of men than they are of God.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.020]   Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.860]   Why?
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.540]   Despite whatever pressures or persecution
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.980]   or whatever things may come as a result of it,
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.080]   fear of God is what causes us to stay on the narrow path.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.900]   In fact, the Scripture says in Romans chapter three,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.260]   verse 10 and on,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.380]   Apostle Paul gives a description of the fall of mankind
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   and what sins that they are guilty of.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.580]   I'm going to just read a portion of it.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.420]   It says, "As it is written,
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.300]   "there is none righteous, not even one.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.940]   "There is none who understands.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.720]   "There is none who seeks for God.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   "All have turned aside.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.060]   "Together they have become useless.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.020]   "There is no one who does good.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.180]   "There is not even one."
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.260]   And he goes on and on.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.600]   And then he concludes that section by verse 18 by saying,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.780]   "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.700]   And so the reason why he puts it that way
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.460]   is all the things that he mentions in the previous verse,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.740]   he says the base reason behind why they are doing that
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.980]   is because they don't fear God.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   They don't know who God is,
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.020]   so they don't understand the consequence of their sin.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.060]   And as a result, they can live in compromise.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.880]   They can live in rebellion.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.340]   But if we think about the spiritual encounter,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.980]   there should be, ought to be,
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.460]   a greater fear of God
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.420]   than any fear we have of the demons.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.420]   In fact, the Bible teaches
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.540]   that whenever the demons encountered Christ,
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.500]   do you remember how they reacted?
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.380]   They got on their knees, begging for his mercy.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.620]   "Son of man, have you come before time to torture us?"
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.820]   And that's exactly what Jesus says.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.220]   Fear, not someone who can destroy your flesh,
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.660]   but your flesh and your soul in hell.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.900]   In other words, fear God,
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.800]   because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.740]   The whole purpose of Mount Sinai
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.460]   was to teach us to understand who God is
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.220]   and where we stand before God.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.540]   The law was given to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.400]   And the reason why he says that is because
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   our natural state is we measure ourselves by ourselves.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.660]   And so, are you good?
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.780]   Well, what do you measure that by?
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.060]   I didn't murder anybody.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.380]   I never went to jail.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.100]   So I'm a decent person because I do this or that.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.900]   But the whole purpose of the law, he says,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.240]   was to reveal just how desperate we are
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.160]   until we recognize that how disgusting sin is.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.620]   I don't know about you,
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.440]   but when I was back in high school,
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.220]   I learned for the first time what goes into hot dogs.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.100]   Right?
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.400]   And some of you guys probably learned it too.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.740]   And then when you first learn it, it's like,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.660]   oh my God, you can't put that in your mouth anymore
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.560]   because, and since then I got over it.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.540]   But once you understand the disgusting nature
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.980]   of these things, you naturally want to stay away from it.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.180]   But part of the reason why we are attracted to sin
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.700]   is because we don't recognize
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.400]   the disgusting nature of the sin.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.380]   Until we recognize the destructive result of sin,
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.500]   that because of sin, the utterly sinful,
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.100]   and what results from the sin,
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.040]   until we recognize the dire need because of the sin.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.720]   So the whole purpose of Mount Sinai
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.000]   and the giving of the law was to reveal
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.320]   exactly where they stood before God.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.600]   It's not to simply put fear in them
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.440]   so that they can see and be brought to the cross
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.480]   and to beg that this is what I need.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:56.080]   See, people who come to Mount Zion
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.740]   without recognizing and understanding Mount Sinai,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.180]   it's like handing out,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:07.960]   it's handing out checks from the government,
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.780]   the stimulus check.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.140]   The purpose of the stimulus check
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.980]   is so that people who lost their jobs can't get groceries
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.060]   so that they can pay their bills.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.420]   But for people who don't need it
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.100]   or don't realize that they need it,
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.420]   it's a down payment for a Tesla.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.700]   A down payment to take a trip.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.500]   They're gonna pass it out, so I'll take it.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.380]   And so we don't recognize the value of it.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.120]   It's just kind of used,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.680]   not to live, but just to enjoy.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.340]   So many Christians who have come to faith
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.180]   not understanding the necessity of the gospel
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.380]   and say, "Who wants Jesus?
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.620]   "I mean, who wouldn't want Jesus?
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.180]   "He loves you unconditionally.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.720]   "And even if you sin, Jesus covers you.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.940]   "One saved, always saved."
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.140]   And if there's a possibility,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.600]   even if there's 1% possibility,
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.820]   that there really is hell,
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.520]   and the gospel is just being passed out, I'll take it.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.940]   And so what ends up happening is,
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.140]   we take the grace of God,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.660]   and instead of recognizing what it is that we have received,
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.020]   the grace of God is given to us so that we can go to God,
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.860]   so that we can be reconciled with this holy God.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.500]   Instead, the grace of God is received
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.540]   so that I can live my life
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.460]   without the fear of hell.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.820]   And so you throw out phrases like,
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.120]   "Oh, we have Christian liberty."
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.360]   So Christian liberty was given to us
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.440]   so that we can use that to freely evangelize,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.520]   so that we can come together,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.800]   the Jews and the Gentiles can come together
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.940]   without having this fear that we're breaking this law.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:42.480]   You've been given liberty to freely come and worship God.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.280]   But an individual who does not recognize
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.400]   where we stand before God,
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.080]   grace is just a free ticket to do whatever you want.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.300]   That's why it's absolutely necessary
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.220]   that we understand the terror of God
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.660]   so that we can grasp the grace of God.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.920]   In Hebrews 12, 18 to 21,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.080]   the description of Mount Sinai, right?
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.400]   This is what it says, remember what it says,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   we talked about this last week,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.320]   "For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched,
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.800]   "and to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom, to whirlwind,
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.520]   "and to a blast of a trumpet,
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.080]   "and the sound of words which sound was such
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.260]   "so that those who heard begged
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.300]   "that no further word be spoken to them,
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.420]   "that his presence was terrifying,
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.620]   "that even his voice when he spoke,
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.340]   "they begged to stop speaking,
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.740]   "for they could not bear the command.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.620]   "If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.740]   "And so terrible was the sight that Moses said,
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.020]   "I am full of fear and trembling."
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.200]   So his presence and giving up the law caused terror.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.980]   In Revelation chapter four, one to three,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.100]   there's a description of Mount Zion,
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.660]   and this is what it says,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.560]   "Then I looked, and behold,
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.280]   "the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion,
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.640]   "and with him 144,000, having his name
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.700]   "and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.120]   "And I heard a voice from heaven."
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.460]   It's the same voice that they heard in Sinai,
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.820]   like the sound of many waters,
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.100]   and like sound of loud thunder,
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.220]   just like it's described in Hebrews,
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.740]   and yet the result was very different,
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.380]   and the voice which I heard was like the sound
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.700]   of harpists playing on their harps,
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.540]   and they sang a new song before the throne
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.660]   before living creatures and the elders.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.980]   You notice how the same voice of God that thundered
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.580]   created terror, begging to tell Moses,
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.940]   please do not, tell him to stop speaking to us directly,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.140]   and we're terrified of him,
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.900]   and yet in Revelation in Mount Zion,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.060]   they hear the same voice, the same sound thunder,
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.520]   and it leads to joy and celebration.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.420]   And it's the same voice.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.700]   How does one mountain cause terror,
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.220]   and the other mountain breaks out in singing?
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.980]   See, that's the gospel.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:04.300]   How that same person could go to Mount Sinai
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.100]   and then come to Zion, and one leads to terror,
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.800]   and one leads to celebration,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   is where the Bible describes the gap of the cross.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.380]   Without understanding that tension,
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.000]   without understanding how we cross this,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.460]   is what causes the superficial worship,
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.220]   why people are bored with their faith
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.420]   because they took the grace of God
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.600]   like just free candy being passed out.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.880]   See, Mount Sinai is the path.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.400]   The same God who caused the terror
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.540]   is the same God that causes joy and worship.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.480]   So it's important that we understand how we got here.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.860]   Mount Zion, he says, is not a place where you can touch.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.660]   There was and is a physical place.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.980]   So where Solomon built his temple
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.440]   was on the Mount Zion, it's a physical place.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.740]   The city of David was Mount Zion.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.500]   The whole city of Jerusalem oftentimes
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.660]   is referred to as Mount Zion.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.660]   Mount Zion is a reference to where God made his dwelling.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.380]   But he said it's not a physical place.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.260]   He's not referring to any of those particular sites
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.420]   because he says it's a mountain that cannot be touched.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.780]   It's a heavenly Jerusalem.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.660]   In other words, it's another word for heaven.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.740]   And so the way that the Bible described Mount Zion,
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.340]   he says in verse 22, it is the city of the living God,
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.000]   a heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.620]   meaning it is a permanent dwelling of God.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.380]   In Psalm 132, 13 to 14, it says,
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.900]   "For the Lord has chosen Zion.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.280]   "He has desired for his habitation.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.420]   "This is my resting place forever.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.900]   "Here I will dwell, for I have desired it."
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.300]   Now the distinction between Mount Zion and Mount Sinai
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.080]   was Sinai was a theophany,
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.760]   meaning that God from heaven
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.180]   decided to make contact with man.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.560]   So temporarily he came and revealed a portion of his glory,
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.500]   not his full glory.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.760]   In fact, remember the picture that I showed you
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.420]   of Mount Sinai where it's just blackened
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.520]   because of his presence and his glory, the fire?
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.600]   Well, it's blackened, but it's not there.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.340]   He just made a mark,
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.380]   but that's not where his glory resides.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.500]   And that glimpse of his glory,
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.340]   his temporary showing of himself
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.540]   created this terror for sinners.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.500]   And yet Zion is a permanent place
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.060]   where he habits, habitats forever
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.740]   in his full glory.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.420]   So how can you possibly,
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.260]   if invitation to Zion or Sinai
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:53.260]   created this terror just by his glimpse of his glory,
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.480]   how can a sinful man possibly be invited to Zion?
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.420]   Again, that's where the tension lies.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.100]   And that was the whole purpose
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.180]   of the giving of the law is to create this tension.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.700]   I need to live.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.860]   Well, where do you go to live?
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.860]   You have to go to that God
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.100]   because he's the author of life.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.420]   He's the one who has the Sabbath.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.160]   So if we want to find eternal rest,
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.860]   he's the one that we need to go to.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.420]   Well, how do I go to him
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.540]   if that God that I need to go to
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.100]   is at Mount Sinai?
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.980]   See, that's what Zion is.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:36.300]   And the nation of Israel understood this paradox,
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.180]   this tension.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:42.060]   You remember when the Israelites were coming out
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.620]   and they're going into the desert
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.660]   and it didn't take them long for them to start grumbling.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.940]   Soon as they felt like the Egyptians were coming,
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.620]   said, "Why did God bring us out here?"
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.460]   Even after all the miracles,
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.460]   they go to the other side,
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.780]   they say, "Oh, I'm so thirsty.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.240]   "We might as well die.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.100]   "It was better in Egypt."
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.700]   And so they just would complain and complain.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.380]   And then God, he burns in his anger
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.260]   and he tells Moses, "If I go with them,
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.800]   "I'm going to kill these people.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.020]   "I'm not going to be able to withhold my anger toward them."
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.680]   And so Moses begs him,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.600]   "If you do not come with us, we will die out here."
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.900]   And so there was this tension
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.020]   that if he dwells in the midst of us,
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.920]   we can die because of his presence.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.380]   But if he doesn't go with us,
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.020]   we will die because his presence is not with us.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.100]   So there was this constant tension of,
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.580]   "We need you here, but we can't have you too close."
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.280]   So if you basically study
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.140]   the Old Testament history of Israel,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.580]   it's God's presence drawing near to Israel.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:46.980]   And every time he comes,
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.540]   he gives them strict, scary revelation
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.260]   that the only way that you're going to live
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.580]   is if I'm in the midst of your presence.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.940]   So he comes from Mount Sinai to the tabernacle,
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.780]   to the tabernacle, to the temple,
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.860]   and he gives them very strict restrictions.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.900]   Remember the book of Leviticus?
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.740]   He says, "I'm going to dwell in your midst,
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.140]   "but the only way that you and I
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.740]   "are going to have any kind of relationship
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.080]   "is you got to follow these rules.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.360]   "You have to recognize who he is.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.680]   "And if you come to my presence in a nonchalant way,
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.520]   "you will die."
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   And that's exactly what happens, they die.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.300]   But you know their history.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.180]   Over and over again,
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.700]   they sin, commit sin against God.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.300]   So in the book of Ezekiel,
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.260]   God has had enough.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.700]   And so his glory begins to be withdrawn
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.580]   from the nation of Israel.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.100]   So there's this scene in Ezekiel chapter 10
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.540]   where the spirit of God,
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.780]   it comes to the Holy of Holies,
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.580]   and it begins to move to the threshold, the outer court.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.820]   And at the outer court, it rests,
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.020]   almost as if it is reluctant to leave.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.580]   And then from there, he goes up to the hilltop,
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.100]   looking over Jerusalem and the temple, reluctant.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.820]   And it was a scene of God's Shekinah glory
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.260]   leaving not just the temple,
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   but Israel because of their sins.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.860]   And as a result of that, the protection for Israel is gone.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   And as soon as that happened,
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.880]   the Babylonians come and they destroy them,
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.120]   take them into captivity for 70 years.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.840]   The prophets tell us the 70 years of captivity happens
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.920]   because they specifically disobeyed God's command
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.140]   for the Sabbath.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.900]   So every one of those 70 years represents a year
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.660]   that they disobeyed God in keeping the Sabbath.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:37.040]   So they understood if God is in our midst,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.100]   we are in trouble, we're terrified.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.020]   But if he's not in our midst,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.660]   we are destroyed by our surrounding.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.240]   And so this constant juxtaposition.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.540]   So the Pharisees had an idea
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.300]   that we don't want this, we need him.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.620]   Even though we're terrified of him,
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.300]   we need it in our presence.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.100]   And so the Pharisees, basically their initial intent was
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.340]   that we're gonna keep the law perfectly.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.660]   And even the word Pharisee basically means holy,
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.420]   to be set apart.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.500]   And that's why I said, you know what,
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.060]   instead of just keeping the Sabbath,
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.640]   we're gonna be meticulous about the Sabbath.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.400]   We wanna make sure that by keeping the Sabbath,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.680]   that we're gonna invite God's spirit back.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   That was their intention.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.700]   So their relationship with God
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.600]   is described in the book of Hosea.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.060]   Where it's kind of like, you know,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   a boyfriend who cheated against his girlfriend.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.740]   And then he comes back begging,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.180]   I'm never gonna do this again.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.940]   And then the girlfriend takes him back,
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.580]   and then, you know, a couple months later,
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.460]   he does the same thing.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.460]   And this cycle is repeated over and over and over again.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.460]   And he means it, but then he can't control himself.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.700]   And that's how it's described in the book of Hosea,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.020]   between the relationship of this prophet and Gomer.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.240]   And he says, this is what our relationship looked like.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.320]   That I kept on being gracious to you, gracious to you,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.080]   but you would continue to prostitute yourself
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.180]   over and over again.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:07.000]   So by the time we come to Christ and his revelation,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.220]   it was to bring us to the point
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.040]   to recognize that we are helpless.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.200]   Even with the best of intention.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.460]   And that's what Paul is describing in Romans chapter seven.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.080]   A relationship with the Jew and the law
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.700]   in Romans chapter seven, verse 13, he says,
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.500]   "Therefore, did that which is good
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.960]   "become a cause of death for me?
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.100]   "May it never be, rather, it was sin.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.460]   "It wasn't the law, but the sin that was residing in me,
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.380]   "in order that it might be shown to be sin
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.480]   "by effecting my death through that which is good.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.620]   "So that through the commandment,
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.220]   "sin would become utterly sinful."
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:44.040]   To bring us to the point where we are desperate for the cross.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.540]   And then if you look at Romans chapter seven,
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.320]   verse 19 and on, he describes, I'm just gonna summarize.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.960]   He says, "What I want to do, I do not do.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.640]   "What I don't want to do, I keep on doing."
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.960]   And then leaves to verse 25,
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.420]   "Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.260]   "Who will set me free from the body of this death?
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:06.160]   "As an unconverted Jew, I have no power
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.060]   "to obey these commands."
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:12.440]   To bring him so that sin would become utterly sinful.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.320]   Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.260]   And so the purpose of Mount Sinai
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.900]   was bring us to this point in verse 24.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.680]   I am ruined, like Isaiah says.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.880]   I'm undone.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:32.280]   If God is the one that I need to run to to have life,
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   and yet the greatest terror is also in him.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.740]   How do I go to him?
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.480]   That's verse 24.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.520]   And that's where chapter eight comes in.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.120]   There is now therefore no condemnation
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.560]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.760]   For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.960]   has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.440]   For what the law could not do,
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.280]   and all the law did was reveal what you should be doing,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.760]   what you could not do,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.320]   which is what he was explaining in chapter seven.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.680]   He has set you free, weak as it was through the flesh,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.120]   God did.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.320]   He doesn't say God will do or he will continue to do.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.200]   He says he did.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.680]   And that's exactly what Jesus meant
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.880]   when he was being crucified on the cross.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.520]   And when he says it is finished,
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.840]   he's not saying that his earthly life is done.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.560]   He's saying that everything that he had decided,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.200]   what God had planned,
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.680]   and was carrying it out for the salvation of mankind
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.960]   so a sinful man can come through Sinai
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.740]   to get to Mount Zion, it is done.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.120]   That's what he means.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.600]   God did.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.960]   Sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.480]   and as an offering for sin,
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.440]   he condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.280]   And that's why he says at the end in verse 24
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.780]   that Jesus' blood speaks better than Abel's blood.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.280]   What does it mean that Jesus' blood
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.240]   is more articulate than Abel's blood?
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.280]   What does that mean?
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.480]   Well, if you go to Genesis chapter four,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.720]   verse nine through 10,
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.160]   and you know the context.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.540]   Cain ends up killing Abel because of his jealousy
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.420]   that God receives his blood sacrifice
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:17.340]   over the other stuff that Cain brought.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.580]   And because he was jealous,
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.060]   he ends up killing him, and God seeks him out.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.180]   And in verse nine it says,
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.580]   then the Lord said to Cain,
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.100]   "Where is Abel, your brother?"
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.500]   God knowing full well
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.580]   that he has already murdered his brother,
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.020]   and he said, "I do not know.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.500]   "Am I my brother's keeper?"
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.660]   Doesn't that reveal everything about him?
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.640]   He just murdered his brother.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.980]   All knowing God asks him,
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.820]   "Where is your brother?"
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.280]   He's like, "What are you asking me?
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.340]   "Am I my brother's keeper?"
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.620]   So you can see the sinfulness of Cain
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.580]   just by the way he answers that.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.900]   And God says, "What have you done?
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.740]   "The voice of your brother's blood
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.820]   "is crying to me from the ground."
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.220]   What does that mean?
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.860]   What is his brother's voice,
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.260]   Abel's blood crying out?
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.860]   For justice.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.140]   That's what he's saying.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.460]   Abel's blood.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.280]   You committed murder,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.280]   and his blood is crying out for justice.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.200]   So when he says the blood of Christ
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.280]   speaks a better word than Abel's blood,
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.180]   he's saying Abel's blood cries for justice,
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.900]   but Jesus' blood cries for mercy and grace.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.780]   That's the deliverance.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.140]   See, you and I, again, recently in a generation,
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.460]   and it's not just this generation, every generation,
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.660]   because you cannot live without justice.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.560]   Justice basically is righteousness.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.600]   You and I cannot live without righteousness.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   There's no law.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.460]   If something wrong is done,
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.260]   there has to be correction.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.620]   So otherwise, you can't live.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:02.780]   But the problem is,
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.680]   when sinners cry out for justice,
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.380]   the first person to get the punishment for that
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.600]   is the one crying for justice.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.860]   I remember years ago when we were
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.300]   doing construction on the other building,
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.500]   not this building, but the building that we had prior,
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   and we hired a Chinese contractor,
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.980]   and he had a bunch of workers there,
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.500]   and I could tell that their English wasn't that great.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.540]   One day I showed up to work,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.220]   and I saw a pool of blood on the ground,
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.800]   where supposedly the sanctuary is supposed to be.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.580]   And my Chinese is just good enough to go to the bathroom
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:43.620]   and find something to eat,
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.740]   but beyond that, I can just pick up words here and there.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:49.020]   But I could tell there was some kind of a fight,
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.380]   and I found out that one of the workers
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   got mad at the other guy,
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.700]   and he took up a wrench,
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.260]   and then he basically poked him on the face.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.420]   So I said, "What's going on?
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.300]   "This is crazy."
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.860]   And so the guy who got poked on the face,
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.080]   I mean, the blood had already stopped bleeding,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.660]   but I could tell where he got punched.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.540]   And the other guy was outside just roaming around,
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.300]   but he was still there.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.520]   But the guy was angry, and he said,
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.780]   "No, apology is not enough.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.180]   "Look at this."
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.300]   And so he's saying this in Chinese, obviously,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.220]   and then one of the guys was interpreting this for me.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.860]   And so he said he wanted to call the police.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.260]   So I said, "Okay," and then called the police.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.500]   So the police come, and he's trying to take a report,
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.700]   but all of a sudden, as soon as the police come,
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.860]   no one speaks English.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.980]   Everybody's playing dumb.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:33.980]   And so it was kind of weird,
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.460]   'cause I know you speak English.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.940]   I just talked to you in English.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:37.940]   I know that guy speaks English.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.020]   I mean, he's broken English, but he speaks enough.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.460]   But all of a sudden, it became quiet.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.340]   But the guy who was wronged, he demanded,
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.540]   it's like, "I want the police."
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.580]   And the police came, and they called the ambulance.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.220]   The ambulance came, but his English really was not good.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.460]   And so after a while, you could tell
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.340]   that the officers who were there
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:59.660]   was the Costa Mesa police officers.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.980]   So something's fishy, right?
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.900]   All of a sudden, nobody speaks English,
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.740]   no one wants to help,
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.020]   and everybody's kind of avoiding us.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.060]   So he kind of caught with
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.900]   that maybe these guys are here illegally, right?
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.140]   And so I was like, "Oh, shoot,
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.620]   "they're gonna get in trouble."
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.660]   And the officers were very nice,
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.900]   and he didn't wanna get them in trouble.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.900]   So he got a interpreter on the phone from the department
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.140]   and started speaking Mandarin
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.500]   to the guy who was in the ambulance,
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.580]   and basically tell him, he said,
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.140]   "If we take this to the police,
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.500]   "and we take this to the court,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   "they're gonna wanna see your papers."
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.540]   And I know exactly what he was talking about.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.980]   And then he gets on the phone,
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.020]   and then she speaks to him in Mandarin,
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.540]   and all of a sudden, he hangs up the phone,
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.620]   he takes everything off,
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.620]   and he jumps off the ambulance, and he was gone.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.820]   And so the officer looked at me, just smiled,
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.340]   just like, "Yeah, that's what I thought."
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.620]   And then they just, just nice enough, and he just left.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.700]   And obviously, we know what happened.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.300]   As much as he wanted justice,
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.620]   he couldn't take it to court,
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.540]   'cause he knew that if he stood before the judge,
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.840]   that he would be judged before the other guy.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.740]   They ended up working this out, right?
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.320]   They ended up, like, the guy started giving him money,
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.860]   and so they just, one guy just,
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.240]   you know, the guy who caused the damage ended up leaving,
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.740]   and he got paid, and so they were able
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.580]   to work it out in that way.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.540]   But the point that I'm trying to make is,
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.440]   sinners cannot stand before a holy God demanding justice,
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.740]   because justice means you get what you deserve.
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.580]   You cannot live without justice.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.100]   But the problem with mankind is that
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.140]   as much as we need justice in order to live,
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.980]   that this justice is going to destroy us.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.800]   That's the tension that the whole world lives under.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.720]   God is the only author of life,
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.440]   and yet if we go to the author of life,
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.920]   we will be destroyed.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:11.480]   But the Bible says, "He didn't bring us to justice."
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.080]   Justice is getting what you deserve.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.260]   Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:24.680]   Where we deserve to be destroyed, and God has mercy on us.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.320]   You get pulled over, you're going 105 miles per hour,
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.080]   the police says, "I'm not going to give you a ticket."
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.320]   That's mercy.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:37.600]   Grace is getting what you don't deserve.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.080]   They pull you over, they decide not to give you a ticket,
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   and they give you a $30 gift certificate to Chick-fil-A.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.500]   That's grace.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.280]   Small grace, but that's grace.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.360]   So justice is getting what you deserve.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.680]   Mercy is not getting what you deserve.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.480]   Grace is getting what you don't deserve.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.080]   And so in the New Testament, God didn't just
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.640]   carry out justice, he absorbed the justice of God,
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:12.280]   that we will be spared from hell that we deserve.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.800]   But he didn't leave us there, he raised us up
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.520]   as co-heirs with Christ, so that when we are in heaven,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.760]   in the presence of this almighty God
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.120]   that would bring terror to sinners,
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.280]   they break out into worship.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.560]   See, when sinners come to Christ,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.920]   not recognizing what it is that we have in Christ,
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.040]   they get bored, because they receive the grace of God
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   like it was just free candy, it was just being passed out,
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.760]   it's like, "Oh, I'll take it, oh, raise your hand,
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.800]   "come down the aisle, oh, okay, I'll take it, just in case."
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.920]   There's so many people in the church, it's harder,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.800]   it's more sacrifice for them to leave the church.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.600]   Because they grew up in the church,
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.200]   they have to forsake relationships.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.880]   Their community is based around Christianity.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.120]   So it's hard for them to leave the church.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.160]   So they stick around, yet never fully grasping
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.560]   what they have in Christ.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.320]   They're never true worshipers,
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.960]   they're attenders of the church,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.640]   but they're not true worshipers of God,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.320]   because worship is something that is inspired
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.080]   because of what you recognize that you have in Christ.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.640]   But a nominal Christian only understands
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.400]   the superficial stuff on the outside, the benefit.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.720]   And so therefore, he's in the church,
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.080]   but he does not know Christ,
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.160]   and yet he never truly worships.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.600]   It doesn't produce joy, it's just obligations,
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.840]   it's the law that I need to obey.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.680]   But we're not attracted to Christ.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.920]   See, the Bible says that we are in eternity
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.200]   with Christ in Zion because he's the new mediator
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.400]   in a new covenant.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   As Moses was mediating between Israelites and God,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.520]   even he himself was terrified.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.800]   And yet Christ stands as our mediator forever in eternity,
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.420]   by his blood, sprinkled, cleansed.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.620]   This is the son of God we're talking about.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.720]   The son of God did that for us.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.160]   He didn't just snap his finger and say,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.440]   you know what, I'm gonna save you from hell.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.160]   The son of God absorbed the justice that you and I deserved.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.080]   And this is what we celebrate.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.760]   When we do not recognize this,
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.480]   we just come to church,
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.840]   check off the things that we're obligated to do,
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.120]   and yet there's no joy in our lives.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.320]   You notice that he doesn't say we will come to Zion,
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.020]   but he says we have come to Zion, we have come.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.640]   Heaven is the ultimate fulfillment
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.800]   of what he already started.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.120]   So we don't live in misery until we get to heaven.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.600]   That life is restored now.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.160]   Here, but not fully fulfilled yet.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.680]   So the greatest evidence of true salvation
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.040]   is the worship that God inspires
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.520]   because of what he has done.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.720]   You know, you and I live
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.240]   in one of the richest places in the world.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.040]   Even if you live in a one bedroom apartment
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.780]   in the worst neighborhoods in this area, in Orange County,
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.240]   you're still living in the most expensive place in the world.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.280]   And I'm not just talking about in our generation,
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.360]   in all the generations put together.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.000]   The kind of access that we have.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.480]   Boba is a luxury that poor people,
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   go to Africa and ask them, you wanna get some boba?
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.800]   I said, boba, what's boba?
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.560]   Well, I gotta go with garage sale.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.380]   Garage sale, what's garage sale?
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.200]   Internet, huh, I heard of it.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:48.820]   And yet, more than not, people live in want.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.820]   I don't have enough.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.820]   'Cause we get on the internet,
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.660]   or we come to church and we compare ourselves
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.260]   with people who have a bit more than we have.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:03.060]   And though we are rich beyond the imagination
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.700]   of the rest of the world, we live every day thinking,
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.300]   only if I had a little bit more.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.860]   But we do the same thing spiritually.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.120]   The Bible says that everything that you and I need
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.020]   for a life of godliness has been given to us
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.120]   in the knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.820]   Everything that you and I need has been given to us
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.940]   in the riches of his glory,
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.660]   and yet most Christians live their lives thinking,
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.280]   only if I had more.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.780]   Only if I had better community.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:35.040]   Only if I had better teaching.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.320]   Only if I had better this and better that.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.060]   Not realizing what it is that we have in Christ.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.600]   So instead of worshiping, we crumble.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.340]   You see, if we don't realize what we have been saved from
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:55.340]   in Sinai, we come to Zion and we're bored.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:02.900]   And sad to say, this is the state of our generation.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.740]   Christians who profess the right things with their mouth,
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.980]   but bored in their walk with God.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.960]   So worship is an obligation.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.940]   Discipleship is an obligation.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.480]   Sharing is an obligation.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.740]   Prayer is an obligation.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.380]   What do I have to do to help me belong to this community?
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.900]   Yet, what does Jesus say?
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.580]   There's gonna come a time where he's not gonna be asking,
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:26.500]   are you worshiping this mountain or that mountain?
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.920]   But he's seeking people who will worship him
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.300]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.220]   Let me conclude with this,
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:36.900]   because this is one of my favorite passages,
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.820]   and those of you who've been in our church for a while,
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.360]   you know, I've read this so many times,
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.280]   but I'm gonna read to you again.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.100]   It's this whole drama of the gospel
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.000]   that is portrayed in the book of Revelations chapter five.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.500]   In verse one it says, "I saw in the right hand of him
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.700]   "who sat on the throne a book written inside
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.240]   "and on the back, sealed up with seven seals."
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.620]   Well, this book he's referring to
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.020]   in other passages in Revelation
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.620]   is referred to as the book of life.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.500]   And the book of life basically is,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.460]   who can be at Zion?
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.260]   That's basically what it is.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.680]   Who can be in the presence of this holy God?
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.260]   And he says, "And I saw a strong angel
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.240]   "proclaim with a loud voice,
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.720]   "'Who is worthy to open up the book and break its seal?'"
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.420]   In other words, who can take a look,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.600]   who can be added to this?
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.980]   "No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.480]   "was able to open the book or to look into it.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.880]   "Then I began to weep greatly
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.140]   "because no one was found worthy to open the book
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.780]   "or to look into it."
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.820]   In other words, oh, what a wretched man.
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:36.160]   There's no hope, no one can open it up.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.160]   Verse five, "And one of the elders said to me,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.000]   "Stop weeping.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.220]   "Behold, the lion that is from the tribe of Judah,
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.060]   "the root of David, has overcome,
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:50.140]   "as so as to open the book and its seven seals."
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.300]   So he says the lion of Judah is coming.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.900]   He is able, no one else is able but the lion of Judah.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.700]   And clearly he's referring to Jesus.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.260]   The lion of Judah is the Messiah that's going to come.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.300]   He says he will come.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.860]   And so John turns his head to look for the lion of Judah
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.780]   and verse six says, "And I saw between the throne
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.040]   "with the four living creatures, the elders,
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.740]   "a lamb standing as if slain.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.840]   "Having seven horns and seven eyes,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.400]   "which are the seven spirits of God,
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.780]   "sent out into all the earth.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.300]   "And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.560]   "who sat on the throne.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.740]   "When he had taken the book,
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.700]   "the four living creatures and the 24 elders
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.400]   "fell down before the lamb,
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.440]   "each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.680]   "which are prayers of the saints.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.340]   "And they sang a new song."
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   Man, lion of Judah, he turns to look for the lion
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:46.860]   and he sees the lamb.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.200]   Because we could not go to the lion,
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.580]   he came as a lamb and covered us with his blood.
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:01.820]   And it is this picture that is portrayed for us
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:05.220]   that causes him to break out in worship
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.780]   and singing a new song.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:13.280]   This is a description of the church.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.460]   This is a description of the church.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.940]   People who have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:25.940]   can help themselves, but to break out in worship,
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.180]   not because it's time to worship,
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.960]   not because they prepared a great set,
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.720]   not because we heard a great message,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.300]   but because we're before a great God.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.680]   Why would you do this for us?
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.500]   Why would you send your only begotten son?
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.320]   I know my sins better than you do.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.260]   I can pick any period of my life,
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.900]   even after I became a Christian,
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.060]   that I would have easily been disqualified.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.660]   And you know your sins better than anybody else.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.460]   You know what you do in secret.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.940]   You know the compromises that you fall into.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.640]   You know how easily you get entangled with this world.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.180]   You know how much you hated God
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.820]   because he didn't answer your prayers
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.260]   and things didn't work out the way you wanted to.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.920]   And yet he continues to invite us to come.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.060]   Why would he do that?
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.420]   Why would he do that?
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.020]   That's the church.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   Church filled with people who have no answer to his love.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.700]   And so we sing a new song.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:48.420]   A song that can never be inspired by anything in this world.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.440]   No amount of young love,
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.780]   no amount of love and treasures in this world
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.820]   that would inspire you like the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.480]   That's the Zion.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.680]   That he's referring to.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.120]   And that's why we need to understand Sinai.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.840]   Because his invitation is to Zion.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.480]   I actually wanna sing a new song with you.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.560]   It's not a new song, it's actually an old song.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.260]   In fact, everything I know is old.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.600]   Amazing Grace, written by John Newton.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.600]   Former slave trader, by his own admission,
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.920]   was worst of sinners.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.580]   And I think, humanly speaking, we could agree.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:39.720]   He lived his adult life doing horrendous things
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.420]   for slave trading.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:46.600]   And on one of his journeys, the boat hits a storm
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.360]   and the ship's about to sink.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.000]   As he's in the water, he begs God for mercy.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.160]   If you save me from this, I will repent and serve you.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.880]   And that's exactly what happens.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.720]   Doesn't happen overnight, but he kept his promise.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.960]   He repents, he lets go of the slave trade.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.680]   In fact, he lives the rest of his life
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   fighting slave trading because he understands
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.120]   the evil of slave trading.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.920]   He's the man behind William Wilberforce
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.320]   who fought against slavery in England.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   And so he writes a song, Amazing Grace,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.520]   to basically as a testimony of his life.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.140]   It starts, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound."
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.620]   You know, we say that word, amazing grace, so often,
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.260]   but we don't take enough time to actually ask,
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.500]   is it really amazing?
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.940]   Is it just words that we say?
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.660]   I think when he penned it, he knew.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:51.880]   He knew how amazing that he would save a wretch like me.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.620]   You know, we may look at that and say,
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.020]   well, I never traded slaves,
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.880]   and I didn't do anything to deserve to go to jail.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.900]   But in the presence of this holy God,
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.660]   our testimony is no different.
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:10.280]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.300]   that saved a wretch like me.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.300]   I once was loved, but now I'm found,
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.040]   was blind, but now I see.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.420]   'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.540]   and grace my fears relieved.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.180]   I mean, it's so profound.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:33.740]   He said the fact that he recognized the terror of God
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.240]   was the grace of God.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.580]   And it was that same grace that relieved him
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.640]   from that fear that he can get to Zion.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.020]   How precious did that grace appear
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.180]   the hour I first believed.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:51.460]   Maybe many of us can remember
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.620]   the first hour we believed, right?
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.900]   How much he meant for us.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.340]   We broke out into songs.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.180]   But so many years of being concerned for life,
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.860]   raising children, so many years have gone by,
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.360]   and we can't confess that that's where we are now.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.940]   How precious did the grace appear
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.780]   the hour I first believed.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.760]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.260]   Repent and do the things that you did at first.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.320]   And it's a call back to our first love.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.740]   The Lord hath promised good to me.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.780]   His word my hope secures.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.780]   He will my shield portion be as long as life endures.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.940]   He's our mediator.
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:36.780]   He protects us.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.060]   His blood covers us.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   When we've been there 10,000 years, Zion,
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.520]   bright shining as the sun,
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.660]   we've no less days to sing God's praise
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.340]   than when we first begun.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.040]   That this new song is never gonna get old.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.940]   It's never gonna get old.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:00.140]   10,000 years and we've just begun.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.660]   And this is a man who understands God's grace.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.580]   This is why it's so important for us
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.200]   to recognize the full counsel of God.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.980]   That we know what it is that we have in Christ
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.540]   so that we may worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.440]   If you would stand up with us
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.200]   and then we're gonna have our praise team
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.120]   lead us in this song.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.240]   So I know this is a song that we probably sung
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.320]   many, many times,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.960]   but I pray that you would sing this with a renewed fervor,
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.200]   understanding the words that this would not just be
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.360]   a song that we sing, but our own testimony.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.180]   Amen.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:52.360]   (gentle music)
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:58.320]   Amazing grace.

[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.860]   Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen stone,
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.360]   a precious cornerstone,
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.000]   and he who believes in him will not be disappointed.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   Lord, we pray that you would continue to open our ears,
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.820]   that we may hear your voice
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.920]   and to know the hope that we have in Christ.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.640]   Know, Lord God, the precious gift
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.240]   that we have been given in his name,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.700]   that we may dwell in your presence forever.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.160]   I pray, Father God, that this truth would transform us,

[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.000]   that wherever it is that you send us this week,
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.320]   that we may be his witness.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
