[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   Hi, I'm Sawako Yamaji, so let me present my testimony.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.020]   So I was born and raised in Japan and moved to United States four years ago for my job
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.020]   in California.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.200]   I first heard about Christ when I was middle school, and I remained interested about Christianity
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.800]   since then.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   I attended a Christian school for 10 years from middle school to college in Japan.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.300]   When I was in my third year of middle school, I was strongly impressed by a pastor's sermon.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:49.720]   The sermon was based on 1 Corinthians chapter 3, "For we are God's fellow workers, you
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   are God's building."
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   The pastor told us that we always need to do our best in daily life because we live
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740]   for God.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.760]   That gave meaning to every question I had at that time, such as what is the purpose
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.000]   of studying, why am I here.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.640]   After I heard that, I started to go to a church outside of the school and started to read
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.160]   the Bible enthusiastically.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.920]   However, I didn't have many friends or family members to talk about Christianity or the
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   Bible, and I was also hesitant to speak to others about how I felt about Christianity.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.200]   As I reflect on my life now, maybe I cared too much about the people and events around
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.760]   me and couldn't focus on what Christianity meant or how it could impact my life.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.640]   During that time, I was attracted to the teaching of God, and I am thankful that I was introduced
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.880]   to Christianity early on, even though I didn't have a saving faith in the gospel yet.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   After I graduated college, I stopped attending church until I came to Bel Air in Irvine.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.400]   During that period, my interests were largely focused on my work.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.080]   My attitude toward others, especially my co-workers, was kind of competitive, and even when my
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.620]   friends and family gave me helpful advice, I was resistant.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.260]   At that time, I was just focusing on how to be better than others, how to improve my career,
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.960]   and how to be successful in my job.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.000]   I was turning away from God for a long time, and my attitude toward others and my relationship
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.920]   with my friends and family was not optimal.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.800]   I regret my selfishness and the time without God, and I won't go back to that time.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.000]   After spending time without God, I returned to Bel Air Community Church in Irvine.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   Through the Bible, sermons, and communication with church members, I realized how sinful
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.520]   I was during the time I stopped attending church.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.640]   Even though Christ gave me a chance to come to Him when I was a student, I didn't follow
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.960]   Him.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.680]   And I realized the way I was communicating with others was very selfish and self-centered.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   Jesus always gave me great instructions about how to live life.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.720]   I regret that I had lived without God, and I tried to be humble, be kind, love others,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.440]   and respond to someone as Christ would.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.800]   In Matthew 6:33 in the Bible, it says, "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.720]   and all these things will be added to you."
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.360]   By following these words from the Bible, I realized that my relationship with others
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.000]   was significantly improved.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   I felt everything in my life was very tough to deal with, but after I changed the way
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.960]   to think and my behavior, everything turned out well.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.840]   I'm thankful that after spending a sinful life without God, God still forgave me after
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.280]   this time and guided me to His path.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.000]   I felt how merciful He is.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   Now I really appreciated Jesus' mercifulness and trust in Him, so I really wanted to show
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.920]   my commitment to following Christ's path for my life that I need.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.880]   I have been praying for forgiveness of my many years of sins.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.640]   Moreover, I am grateful that He died on the cross to show that He had taken all my sins.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.180]   And He came back to life to verify that His work on the cross was complete.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.520]   For these reasons, I would like to be baptized.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   And after receiving Christ, I felt that I could be more open-minded and communicate
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   with others actively.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.400]   Moreover, I trust Jesus and no longer have any hesitation to share my honest feelings
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.280]   about Christianity with others.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.040]   In conclusion, I confess my time without God and ask forgiveness for my sins.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   I would like to refocus my life on God.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.200]   As such, I would like to turn away from sin and turn towards God.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.400]   To further pursue my life in God, I would like to express my faith in Jesus and be baptized.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   Thank you.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   [Applause]
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   [Applause]
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   [Applause]
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   [Applause]
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   [Applause]
