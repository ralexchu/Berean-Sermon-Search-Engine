[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.360]   I'm going to be reading from Hebrews chapter 6, verses 4-8.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.020]   For in case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.740]   been made partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.520]   of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.900]   since they again crucified to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.100]   For ground that drinks the rain, which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.120]   to those, for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.860]   But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.460]   ends up being burned.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.900]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.260]   Heavenly Father, we pray that Your word would be anointed this morning, that our hearts
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.160]   may be softened, that our ears may be opened to You.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.580]   May Christ be exalted.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.380]   Help us, Lord God, to glean and understand Your intent of this text, that we may not
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.140]   turn from it to the left or to the right, that we would not subtract from it or to add
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.780]   to it.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.140]   May Christ, His love, His glory be magnified this morning.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.540]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540]   Amen.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.980]   All right, so the text that we're in, if you've ever studied through the New Testament or
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.300]   this passage, if you had a chance to look at it, you know that this is one of the passages
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.380]   that is probably the most talked about, or one of the most passages that are talked about.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.780]   In fact, Martin Lowe Jones, if you know who he is, says about this text that this is probably
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.080]   one of the most debated texts in the New Testament, not because it's difficult to understand,
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.440]   but because of the consequence of the meaning.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.700]   The question that we pose from this text is, can Christians lose their salvation?
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   This is a very, very important text for us to understand, because this is where, again,
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.980]   there's many other texts that we would look at to try to answer that question, but this
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.760]   is probably at the heart of the issue.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.540]   So depending on how you understand this text, how you interpret it properly, you're going
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900]   to lean one way or the other.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.740]   Now the reason why this is so crucial is because if you, again, and I'm telling you ahead of
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.460]   time my opinion, which I believe is true, and I'm going to try to convince you of that,
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.900]   that Christians cannot lose their salvation.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.860]   If you were not aware of that, you want to make aware clear today that Christians cannot
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.580]   lose their salvation.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.460]   And if you misinterpret passages like this to say that a genuine Christian who was chosen
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.400]   and elected by God, that by not living up to what God called them to, making too many
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.860]   mistakes in their life, that somehow they're going to be falling from grace and there's
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.460]   no repentance for them.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.500]   That false understanding of Scripture can lead you to live in fear, much like the Jehovah
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.700]   Witnesses who every Saturday morning are going door to door, and if you ask them, "Do you
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.940]   have assurance of salvation?"
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.860]   They will tell you that they cannot know.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.780]   The best that they can do is to work as hard as they can and hope that their good works
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.060]   outweigh their bad works.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.660]   And if you're not careful, a false understanding of our salvation will lead to a life that
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.860]   has lived in constant fear, that maybe I made too many mistakes, maybe I've exhausted the
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.340]   grace of God, and maybe God gave me a number of times that I'm able to repent, and I've
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.940]   exhausted that, so therefore I cannot be saved.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.820]   It is absolutely crucial, it is essential for the foundation of our faith to have assurance
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.820]   of salvation that is firm.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.140]   You cannot pray in confidence, you cannot come to Christ in confidence.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:20.220]   How can you ever enter the throne of grace with confidence if your assurance of salvation
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.220]   is not clear?
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.420]   But on the other end, if you confess that one saved always saved, that you cannot lose
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.540]   your salvation, and a false and superficial and incomplete understanding of God's sovereignty
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.140]   leads us to think and apply that since our salvation is not by our works, it doesn't
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.220]   matter what we do.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.940]   It'd be nice if we lived holy lives and bore fruit, but it doesn't matter.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.060]   So the other end is to kind of live a nominal Christian life all their life, and then hold
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.980]   on to something that they heard, one saved always saved, salvation by grace alone, so
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.140]   our life doesn't matter.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.660]   Absolutely false.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.220]   And that's what we've been talking about in the book of Hebrews.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.700]   The either end of false understanding or incomplete understanding of our salvation will either
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:20.060]   lead to living in constant fear and questioning our connection with God, or living in licentiousness.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.660]   And there is no distinction between the world and a nominal Christian, other than the fact
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.660]   that he may attend church on a regular basis.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.340]   This is why this question is so important.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.140]   Now I've already told you what I believe, but what I believe doesn't matter, right?
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.740]   Because my goal here this morning is to show you through the text that he is not saying
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.180]   that a Christian can lose his salvation.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.380]   Now when you're studying the Bible, right, if you're a faithful Berean, what is at the
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.340]   core, in interpretation, how important, what is the number one thing that you need to understand
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.740]   in properly interpreting that passage?
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.740]   Starts with a C.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.000]   Context, right?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.440]   You have to know the context.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.020]   You can't, if somebody writes you a five page letter, you can't go to page three and take
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.180]   a paragraph out and say, "Ah, I understand this letter."
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.500]   You cannot, right?
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.020]   You have to understand that passage in the context of the rest of the letter.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.020]   Why was that letter written?
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.060]   Who is it written to?
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.060]   What is the purpose?
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.060]   What is the goal?
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.020]   And so that paragraph needs to be understood in the context of what he says.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.980]   And so a lot of times people get misquoted because they don't look at the whole context
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.300]   and they only take words.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.680]   You said this, but you don't quote the whole context.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.120]   So can a Christian lose his salvation?
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.540]   Absolutely not, because it contradicts the context or the theology of rest of Scripture.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.700]   And I'm going to just read you a couple.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.280]   I can take dozens and dozens, but I'm just going to, for the sake of time, John chapter
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.720]   10, 27 and 30.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   Jesus says, "My sheep, they hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.560]   Jesus is saying this before they follow him, right?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.200]   He calls them "my sheep" before they follow him.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   My sheep, when they hear my voice, if they're really my sheep, they will come.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   If they hear the gospel.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.640]   "And I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.480]   them out of my hand.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.360]   My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.760]   out of the Father's hand, and I and the Father are one."
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.800]   Now, that text alone is clear enough and strong enough to say that there's no way that a Christian
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.840]   can lose his salvation, because that's what Jesus says.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.560]   But again, I could give you countless number of passages.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.600]   First Peter 1, 3-5, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.880]   to his great mercy has caused us to be born again."
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   He caused us to be born again, "and to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:58.000]   from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and will not fade
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   away."
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.040]   Reserved in heaven for you, why is it imperishable, undefiled, and not fade away?
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.480]   Verse 5, "Who are protected by the power of God through faith, for a salvation ready to
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   be revealed in the last time."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   In other words, our salvation is securely in his hand.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.600]   Jesus is not simply the author of our salvation.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.720]   He says he's the perfecter of our salvation.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.080]   He doesn't just begin and call us, he makes sure that we are completed.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.560]   That's exactly what it says in Philippians 1, 6, right?
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.640]   "He who began a good work in you will carry it onto completion until the day of Christ."
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.720]   Again, the last verse I want to quote, Romans 8, 38-39, "For I am convinced that neither
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.760]   death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.720]   powers nor height nor depth nor any other created things will be able to separate us
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.440]   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.840]   Nothing, nothing can separate us.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.960]   I mean, he goes on and on and on, saying nothing can separate us from the love of Christ.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.540]   Again, I could just probably just spend the rest of the year just talking about our security
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.320]   in Christ because our salvation is by God's choice.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.120]   We are elected, right?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.840]   We are chosen by God.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.640]   So one, it contradicts the larger theology, right, that our salvation is secure in his
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   hand.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.620]   But it also contradicts the immediate context of what he says.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:39.520]   Because in verse 6, he describes that he, there's a description of these people in verse
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.280]   4 and 5, and it says, "If you have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.800]   to repentance."
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:55.900]   Now why would somebody who falls away because of his sin not be able to repent?
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.040]   That is inconsistent with anything else we see in Scripture.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.920]   The Scripture clearly says in 1 John, "If you confess your sins, he is faithful and
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.800]   just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness."
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.400]   How many times do you forgive your brother?
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   Seven times?
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.120]   No, seven times seventy, as long as he repents.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.520]   So why would he say here, if a Christian can lose his salvation, if that's what he's referring
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.080]   to, why will he not be forgiven of his sins if he repents again?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.320]   So think about our particular situation without even looking at the text.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.160]   How many of you, how many of you at some point after you became a Christian, lived a period
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.240]   of life, whether it was a month, whether it was a week, whether it was for years, that
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.160]   you were in rebellion against God?
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.320]   Maybe living in sin and unrepentant, maybe.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.920]   Does that mean that if you did that, that you couldn't repent, that God didn't forgive
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   you of your sins?
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.560]   So if you've made that mistake and you lived any period of your life fallen away, that
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.680]   there is no repentance for you?
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.920]   Is that what he means by that?
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.440]   He could not possibly mean that because that again contradicts the rest of Scripture.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.000]   I hope this isn't too early for you.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.800]   This is essential.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.040]   So if you're half falling asleep, which you're not, I don't see it yet, I'm just saying it
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.960]   just in case it comes in.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.360]   Let the spirit of sleep be cast away.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.880]   This is very important.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.600]   So it contradicts the immediate context.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:33.880]   In verse 8, it ends by saying, "But if it heals," after all of this, after all the benefits
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.640]   have been given, "If it heals thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.000]   and it ends up being burned."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.680]   In other words, he's talking about an individual after everything that they've been given,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.000]   there is no fruit.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.520]   How can that be a description of a Christian?
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.400]   So this cannot be in reference to a Christian who is falling because it contradicts the
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.800]   larger context, it contradicts the immediate context.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.480]   Then who is he referring to?
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.720]   Again, this is why you have to understand this in the context of the rest of Hebrews.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.520]   Who has he been talking to?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.200]   The church.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.320]   But the church that he is talking to at one point was fervent in following Christ, but
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:26.040]   because of pressure, because of trials in life, they began to not deny Christ, but began
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.080]   to drift.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.840]   And they weren't anchored in Christ.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:37.800]   And the concern is that if you continue to go down this path, you may find yourself apostate.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.200]   That even though you may have never shaken your fist at God, that your unbelief, if that's
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.720]   who you really are, is going to cause you to drift far away.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.600]   And then you're going to find yourself waking up one day that maybe you never believed to
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.520]   begin with.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:13:00.460]   And so the purpose of Hebrews chapter 6 verses 4 through 8 is, one, to get the church to
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.880]   wake up.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.120]   To get the church to wake up.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:11.040]   So if you, or the readers of Hebrews, have been just kind of drifting along thinking,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.800]   you know what, it's safe for me to have some Judaism and some Christianity, live right
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:22.000]   in the middle, and not avoid as much persecution from the Judaistic world as possible, avoid
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.360]   as much discomfort for being a follower of Christ as possible, and kind of, you know,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.680]   trying to gain both sides.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.560]   Trying to live as comfortable as you can, get as much as you can from the church, get
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.400]   as much as you can from the world, and just kind of drift.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.180]   And he's drawing the line very clear that that is not a Christian.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:50.160]   You cannot be in this middle ground, because Jesus clearly said, you cannot serve God and
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   Mammon.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:58.280]   No matter how hard you try, no matter how wise we think we are, it is not possible.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.840]   Either you are with him gathering, or you are against him scattering.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   There is no middle ground.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.200]   So he's warning the church.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.360]   In case wrong thinking has penetrated into the church to believe that it is possible
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   to do that.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   That maybe you think, well, you know, Berean is too serious.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.120]   Maybe if I didn't go to Berean, I would never hear this.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.280]   It's not about being Berean, it's not about what's coming off of my mouth, but what does
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.600]   the scripture say.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.160]   If you're going to argue, don't argue against the church.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.240]   Don't argue against, I don't like this church, or I like that church.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.200]   If you're going to have a debate, make sure it's a biblical debate.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.680]   Because all of our authority is coming from the word of God.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.700]   Now having said all of that, how do we explain this description?
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:57.120]   How do we explain these five, six things that are described that sound a lot like Christians?
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.800]   Talking about being enlightened, tasting the heavenly gift, may partakers of the Holy Spirit
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.920]   taste the good word of God and the powers of the age to come.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.080]   How can that not be a Christian?
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.000]   So what we want to do this morning is examine what he means by these things.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.200]   So first, he says they are enlightened.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.320]   If after having all of these things and then you reject God, there is no repentance.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   What does he mean by that?
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.920]   So one, this is a description of somebody who is enlightened.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.560]   Now he's not talking about a born again Christian where his eyes are open, he sees the glory
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.080]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.800]   When he says enlightened, he's talking about somebody who has been given the truth.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.240]   He has been given the truth.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.760]   Just like the demons in the book of James, who says you believe that God is one.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.520]   Even the demons believe that and they shudder.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   So basically, all they're doing is acknowledging facts.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.700]   So they've been given facts and information.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.960]   So these are people who are in the church who can regurgitate the gospel.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.880]   Because they've been taught since they were little kids.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.740]   It's just Sunday school, they memorize scripture.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.960]   And your whole world centers around Christianity.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:24.720]   So if you want to participate in the community that you belong to, you need to be educated
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.080]   in the gospel.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   And if you're not interested in being educated in the gospel, you probably would have left
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.000]   a long time ago.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.880]   But there's just enough interest.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.320]   But the interest is not Christ.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.280]   Interest is the church.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.160]   So you will do what is necessary to be a part of the church.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.800]   And so that's who he's describing.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.760]   Someone who is enlightened, information has been given, and somebody who the Bible describes
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.720]   as always learning but never able to come to the truth.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   Always learning.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.800]   They're always adding more information.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.280]   And because you are able to regurgitate information that you have heard, eventually if you stay
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.040]   in the church long enough, you can become a teacher.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.480]   Possibly a leader.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.200]   Maybe even a pastor or an elder.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.040]   Because you have been enlightened.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.120]   Information has been given to you and poured into you.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.920]   So you know how to answer certain things.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.280]   And you know how to talk about the Bible.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:29.040]   I think a good example of this are the 5,000 people who are fed.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.380]   And they saw who Jesus was.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.640]   They believed that he was the Messiah.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.720]   And they want to forcefully make him king.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.400]   But Jesus saw right through them that their view of Christ was deficient.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.240]   You're coming to me because you want to eat and you want more of it.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.800]   But Jesus is saying, I don't just give bread.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.080]   Only reason why I give you bread is because I want you to know that I am the bread of
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.560]   life.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.080]   And when he began to speak in those terms, they said, this is too hard.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.360]   In other words, we don't believe him.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.640]   How can a man be saying this?
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.560]   And as a result of that, John 6, 66, they all turn away from Christ.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.120]   See they were enlightened.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.920]   They were given opportunity to see Jesus and his miracles.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.880]   But they didn't come all the way to Christ.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.480]   John chapter 8, 31.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.080]   After presenting the gospel and who he is to the Jews, it says, so Jesus was saying
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.960]   to those Jews who had believed him.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.320]   Pay very close attention to this.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.280]   He's talking to Jews who had believed him.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.120]   If you continue in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.920]   And you will know the truth and truth shall set you free.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:49.760]   What does Jesus call these Jewish believers here in John 8, 44?
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.080]   Children of the devil.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:19:00.680]   How can he call Jews who believed in the very next passage in John 8, 44, he says, you don't
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   know me because you're not from my father.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.600]   It's because you're from your father, the devil.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.280]   So what was deficient?
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.400]   Even though they believed him, there was something deficient.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.520]   They did not believe Christ all the way.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.960]   There was certain aspect of Christ that they wanted, but they didn't want Christ himself.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.880]   When you get married to somebody, you can't get married and say, you know what?
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.640]   I want to be married to this, this, and this.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.280]   I love the way she serves me.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.760]   I like her personality, but I don't like what she does for a living.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.040]   I don't like her family.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.080]   I don't like the way she talks.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.960]   You can't just pick and choose and say, I'm going to be married to these four qualities,
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.000]   and I don't want to be married to these eight qualities.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.360]   You can't do that.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.840]   When you marry that somebody, you marry all of it.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.080]   So these are people who have been enlightened, who have been shown, but they're kind of picking
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   and choosing.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.020]   They didn't come to Christ all the way.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.520]   So they've just been given the opportunity.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   That's what enlightened means.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.840]   Enlightenment says they have tasted of the heavenly gift.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.600]   Tasted.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:13.920]   Now when Christ offers himself as the living water or as the bread of life, imagine if
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   they said, you know what?
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.380]   Give me a taste.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.880]   What is the purpose of tasting?
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.400]   Let me give you an example.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   Now when Costco opened up, I forgot how long it was.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.480]   It was almost 20 some years, 30 some years.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.080]   Before Costco, what was it called?
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   Price Club.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   Okay.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   So those of you who are a little bit older, remember.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.040]   So it used to be called Price Club.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.760]   So when they first opened up, people flocked to it.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.900]   Obviously the prices were good, but there was a lot of people, including myself, who
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:55.360]   used to love going to Price Club because of the free food, the samples.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480]   And they would just give samples.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.880]   I mean, they give samples now, but at that time, that was kind of like their main marketing
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.280]   tool to get people into Costco.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.480]   And so, yeah, I hate shopping, but I love Costco for that purpose.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.920]   And I had, you know, as a college student or, you know, young person, I had no money
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   and I had no intention to buy any of this stuff, right?
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.240]   Because that was my lunch.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.720]   That was my, the samples were my lunch.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.440]   So I would go and grab this and pretend like walking around and come back.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.960]   Hopefully they forgot me and then I would eat it again.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   And then I'd go pretend like I'm going to buy some stuff and then come back and eat
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.660]   it again if I liked it, right?
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.300]   But I never had any intention of purchasing that.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.200]   But the purpose of why they're giving samples is that so you would taste and see that it
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.920]   is good and that you would buy it.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.520]   See the description of somebody who have tasted the heavenly gift is somebody who has tasted
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:57.360]   the water, who has tasted the bread, but you have never intended to purchase.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.720]   You don't come all the way to Christ.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.160]   You've tasted it and you can say, "Yeah, Christ is great.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.560]   The gospel is awesome."
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.220]   But that's about where you stay.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.560]   You're always just kind of roaming around in the world and you're just nibbling.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.480]   But you don't understand when Christ says, "I have come to give life and to give this
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.960]   life abundantly."
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.640]   You don't know what that means because all you've been doing is nibbling.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:33.120]   So he's talking about somebody on the outside looks a lot like a Christian, but the church
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:40.760]   is something that they have to get out of the way to get to what they really want, BBA,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.860]   softball, hangout, football.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.180]   So church, Bible study, prayer meetings are things that needs to get done because that's
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.600]   the price you need to pay to be a part of this group.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.560]   So you nibble and you serve and you give a little, but that's not where you find Christ.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.640]   That's not where you find true joy.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.240]   So church is where you come to serve, but to find life, you have to go out to the world.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.680]   That's what he's talking about, an individual who has tasted the heavenly gift.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.240]   He has not feasted.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.440]   He didn't drink of it, so he's no longer thirsty.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.600]   He's still thirsty because he's only tasted it.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.520]   He's only nibbled in the bread, so he's still hungry.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.760]   And this hunger is leading him always to something else.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.120]   There's a little thing that I found years ago that I think that describes many people
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.760]   in the church.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.920]   I'll have 10 cents worth of God.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.080]   I want enough to get a taste to actually have him or to think that I have him, but not so
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.280]   much that it costs me much.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.480]   I don't want to get distracted from the things that I really want.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.880]   I don't want to be consumed by a huge dose of God.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.760]   I want enough to feel pretty good about myself, enough to make my life respectable and manageable,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.680]   enough to get me through the pearly gates.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.600]   I'll have 10 cents worth of God, please.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.660]   This is the person that he is describing here.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.880]   Somebody who has tasted the heavenly gift.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.440]   Somebody who has ultimately never purchased, only been enlightened.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.680]   He is a partaker of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.720]   Now that's really confusing.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.040]   How can a non-Christian be a partaker of the Holy Spirit?
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.800]   You remember in the Old Testament the difference between the Old Testament saints and the New
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.240]   Testament saints?
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:43.360]   He says John the Baptist, of all the men born of a woman, John the Baptist is the greatest
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.860]   from the Old Covenant.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.880]   But he says in the New Kingdom he is the least.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   Why is he the least?
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.080]   What was the distinction between the Old Covenant people and the New Covenant people?
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.100]   It was the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.120]   In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit never made an indwelling.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.440]   It never made an indwelling because we were sinful.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.400]   Even though Christ was going to come and he was going to cover us by his blood, the Holy
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   Spirit would come upon people and then he would leave.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.880]   You see that with King Saul.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.440]   Although he was a man who was rejected, the Holy Spirit would come upon him and he would
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.540]   be able to prophesy and then he would be gone.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.160]   God never saw him as his man.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   And yet the Holy Spirit was moving with people in the Old Testament.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.440]   The distinction between the Old Testament people and the New Testament people, when
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.560]   we come to the New Testament, where is the Holy Spirit indwelling?
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.000]   In us.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Inside of us.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.240]   It makes an indwelling in us.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   We have this union with Christ that is permanent and eternal.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.120]   That's why 1 Corinthians 6.19 says, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.320]   Holy Spirit?"
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.040]   Our body itself is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have from God
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.360]   and that you are not your own.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.520]   In the Bible again, in John chapter 3, Jesus says to Nicodemus, "The only way that you
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   can be in the kingdom of God is to be born again."
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.120]   Well how was a man born again?
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.200]   He says, "By the Holy Spirit."
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.400]   So the Holy Spirit is the agent in which we are born again and when we are born again,
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.940]   the Holy Spirit makes an indwelling in us.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.360]   So we don't just partake of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.160]   We are united with the Holy Spirit and that's what guarantees our salvation because the
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.800]   Holy Spirit in us is constantly groaning on our behalf to what?
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.360]   To bring us to the Father.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.880]   And that's why a Christian, a genuine Christian who has the Holy Spirit in him cannot continue
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.640]   to live in sin because the Holy Spirit is grieved.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.100]   We're constantly convict.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.960]   And that's why an individual who is constantly living in sin, maybe, and I'm not talking
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.400]   about somebody who is struggling.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.220]   Every Christian struggles with sin.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:06.240]   But somebody who is living in sin and feels perfectly fine and there is no grieving in
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.560]   their heart, it may be evidence that the Holy Spirit is not in them.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:17.680]   And so he's describing it not an individual who has the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:24.160]   and the Holy Spirit leaves him because he foresees God, but somebody who is in the church,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.140]   who has tasted the heavenly gift, who has been enlightened, who participates in the
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.520]   work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.780]   What's happening in our church, in every church, every genuine church is the work of the Holy
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.600]   Spirit.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.960]   And so a non-Christian could be in the midst of this, enjoying the benefits of the work
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.720]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.480]   The work of the Holy Spirit could benefit you because of the sanctification, because
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.840]   of the nice people around you.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.400]   But he does not have an indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.280]   And the most obvious evidence of that is there is no power.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.120]   Because in Acts 1.8 it says when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will receive what?
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.680]   Power.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.600]   Power.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.880]   Power and the Holy Spirit go hand in hand, but this is an individual who is just kind
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   of partaking of it.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.760]   He's kind of joined himself with other people with power.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:29.840]   That's why this individual always has testimonies of other people to regurgitate.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.760]   So it sounds like they have power, but it's never about themselves.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.920]   It's not what God did to them.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.080]   It's not how God saved them from darkness.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.640]   God saved them from an empty way of life.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.580]   It's always about that person.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.440]   My pastor, my leaders, my friends, the missionaries.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.520]   And there's always a testimony about other people.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.960]   But they've never experienced the power of themselves.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.400]   The transforming power of the Holy Spirit that convicts us, revives us, renews us, and
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.760]   at times rebukes us to bring us to Christ.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.320]   So this is somebody who is saturated with a church.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.200]   Maybe it's somebody who was raised in the church, had convinced themselves, even though
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.440]   their life looks nothing like what they see in the New Testament, but it looks a lot like
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.880]   what they see in the church.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.080]   And so their confidence doesn't come from what they read in the scripture.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   Their confidence comes from whatever community that they have belonged to.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   Fourthly, again, taste it, the good word of God, and the power of the age to come.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   Taste it.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   The Greek word for the word here is not logos.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:50.440]   Typically, when we think about Christ and his manifestation and his very breath that
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.640]   he invested in the word, it's the word logos.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.980]   The word logos is almost equated with God himself.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.080]   But the word here is not logos, but rhema.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.320]   And the word rhema is oftentimes spoken of the spoken word.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.920]   So this is talking about people who are in the church who is hearing.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.600]   The word of God is not in them.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.640]   They're just tasting the word.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   In other words, they're hearing sermons, they're participating in Bible studies, maybe even
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.600]   memorizing scripture.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.480]   And the word of God is coming to them, but they've only tasted it.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.700]   They've tasted the powers of the age to come.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.140]   They know what it's like, but they themselves do not know.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.300]   In Jeremiah chapter 15, 16, it says, "The words were found and I ate them."
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.940]   He didn't just taste them, he said, "I ate them.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:47.500]   And your words became for me a joy and a delight of my heart, for I have been called by your
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.060]   name, O Lord God of hosts."
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.900]   Let me say something.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.740]   This is personal.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.020]   I've been preaching up on a pulpit since I was 19.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.060]   I probably shouldn't have, but I did.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.140]   I've been preaching since I was 19, so there was only a stretch of about six months before
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.220]   this church was started where I wasn't preaching up on a pulpit.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.580]   So I don't know how many sermons that is, but it's a lot of sermons.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.020]   In some weeks, I preach three or four times, and then I would go to retreat.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:22.460]   So if you calculate all of that, it probably comes out to thousands of sermons.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:29.180]   So one thing that I can tell you, and I'm not saying it's accurate, but just from what
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:35.380]   I've observed through the years, I can tell where you are in your walk with God by the
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.900]   way you react to the Word of God.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:44.700]   Now, it's like, "Okay, now I better pay attention," because I see you.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.220]   I can tell.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:51.000]   Before you ever come to me and tell me something's going on in your life, I can tell.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.860]   By the way the Word of God is getting in you.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.580]   And again, you could say, "Well, I mean, maybe I'm just boring."
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.460]   That could very well be the case, and I've given flops in the past, so I'm not saying
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.140]   that that's not possible, right?
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.980]   But I'm not talking about how you react to me.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:15.380]   I'm talking about how you react to God's Word, because Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice."
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.900]   Even if I do a great job in packaging it or don't do a great job in packaging it, the
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.380]   children of God are able to hear His voice.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:33.860]   So when I listen to sermons, sometimes the person who does the greatest job packaging
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.980]   is more of a distraction to me, because that's not what I want to hear.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.740]   I don't want to hear somebody who is so polished and knows how to give the best illustrations
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.660]   and keeps the congregation laughing and crying, and all of that stuff may be easier to listen
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.500]   to, but that's not what I'm attracted to.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.820]   What are you going to have is somebody who's stuttering and his point is not clear, but
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.180]   I can clearly sense Christ in what he says.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:05.060]   And I get a lot more out of that sermon than I do from the packaging.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:12.540]   So my point is, after all these years, I can observe and I can testify where you are in
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.460]   your walk with God based upon how you listen to the Word of God.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.940]   Again, like I said, it's not me, but to His Word.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.300]   What is your interaction with God's Word?
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.540]   Is there a hungering and thirsting for Him, or is it for the church, or is it for the
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.140]   community?
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:37.780]   See, this person is an individual who has only tasted the Word of God, but he has no
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.780]   intention of ever eating them.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.140]   In Psalm 1, 1-3, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.140]   nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.620]   in the law of the Lord."
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.460]   His delight is in the law of the Lord.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.740]   You know, I've been so thankful with Pastor Peter Chung coming back to our church because
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.540]   he brought Bible memory back to church.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.620]   And so I know there's bits and pieces, and we're memorizing one verse for every passage
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.300]   that we've been trying to do that, but Pastor Peter Chung just kind of took it to the next
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   level.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.340]   You know, we say, "Oh, his memory is ridiculous," right?
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.380]   But as ridiculous as his memory is, it's not just his memory.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.620]   He devotes that kind of time to the memorization.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.740]   Every time I come to church, he's there early in the morning, and he's got his cards out,
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:31.100]   and he's reading this, and he's memorizing this every single morning, card after card
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   after card.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.360]   So he has a great memory, but he's maximizing the gift that God has given him.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.740]   So I'm very thankful, right?
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.980]   You cannot do that if you do not love His Word.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.500]   It doesn't matter how great your memory you have.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:50.380]   It doesn't matter how much grit you have in saying, "I want to do this," if you do not
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   have the love for that.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.100]   It'll last for a little bit, but it will not carry you through.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:00.780]   It's an individual who's just putting up with Bible study because I really want to hang
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.740]   out with my friends.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:10.660]   And if that is a constant state of where you are at, this is a warning.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:20.420]   Because a non-Christian in the church looks a lot like a Christian in the church.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.740]   This is not unique to this passage.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.420]   Jesus has been warning about that from the beginning.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:34.820]   Hebrews chapter 6, 6, "And then, after having experienced all of these things, have fallen
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.820]   away."
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.260]   It is impossible to renew them again to repentance since they again crucified to themselves the
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.860]   Son of God and put Him to open shame.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.980]   Why can they not be brought to repentance?
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.860]   The point that he's trying to make here is you have been enlightened.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   You have tasted the goodness of God.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.060]   You have tasted the Word and the power to come.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:03.140]   You have every opportunity that every Christian has, and you choose to say, "He's not enough."
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.500]   There is no other way.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.280]   There is no plan B.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:15.820]   If every opportunity has been given to you to lead you to the only way of salvation,
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.780]   and you say, "It's not enough."
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.780]   That's what he means.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.220]   There is no way to bring that person to repentance because repentance is found in Christ and
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.180]   Christ alone.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.180]   In Matthew 12, 31, "Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.140]   people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven."
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.260]   Most commentaries believe that he's talking about rejecting Christ.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.820]   And again, 2 Peter 2, 20, "For after they have escaped the defilement of the world by
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.640]   the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.180]   are overcome.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.540]   The last day has become worse for them than the first.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.300]   For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.020]   known it to turn away from the holy commandment handed onto them.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   It has happened to them according to the true Proverbs, 'A dog returns to his own vomit
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.820]   and so after a washing returns to wallowing in the mire.'"
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.700]   Can you put up the picture?
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.900]   The next slide?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.420]   Next one.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.900]   Next one.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.900]   The picture.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.340]   Okay, I'm looking over there.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.460]   You know, Esther showed me this picture when she was doing VBS and I thought this was really
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.460]   interesting.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.020]   This is a picture of the wheat and the tares.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.020]   Now the way that it's pictured here, you would think that you would be able to distinguish
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.500]   between the wheat and the tares, right?
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.940]   Remember Jesus gives that parable in Matthew 13, 24-30?
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.820]   He gives the parable how the farmer goes out and he plants wheat and then his enemy comes
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.740]   to destroy his crops, he would plant tares.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:59.180]   Tares basically are weed and it basically sucks up all the nutrients that the wheat
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.060]   needs to take in order to destroy the crop.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.680]   But he says you cannot pull the tares out because in doing so, you're going to end up
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.420]   tearing up the wheat too because it looks too similar.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.940]   Now in this picture, you have a bunch of wheat and then you have a couple of the tares.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.700]   But when you have these two things put together and mixed together, it is almost impossible
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:29.500]   to be able to distinguish because it looks exactly alike until it is full grown.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   And that's exactly what he says.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.940]   If you continue to read that parable, he says until the harvest comes.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.140]   You wait for the harvest, you wait for the wheat to grow and when the wheat begins to
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:45.020]   grow in, it says it begins to bend because of the weight of the wheat.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:49.940]   The tares, because it does not have wheat, it just keeps going straight up.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:55.640]   But until you allow it to bear fruit, you can't tell the difference.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.380]   So he says it is impossible to separate them early on.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:07.020]   You have to allow it to grow and you can tell by their fruit.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.520]   Now when Jesus was telling this parable, every Jew, every listener would have understood
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.000]   this because they knew the difference.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.200]   And so the distinction that he was making is these tares in the church who have no interest
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.280]   in the things of God.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.880]   They're just benefiting from the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.080]   They have no interest in the Word of God.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.040]   They're not interested in Christ.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.300]   They just want to participate.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.560]   They just want to play basketball.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.160]   And so the things that bother them have nothing to do with Christ.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.880]   He says you can't tear them apart because while you're doing that, you may end up tearing
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.660]   out the wheat.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.860]   But let time pass.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.880]   You will be able to see what is in their hearts.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.220]   That's who he's describing here.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:04.760]   And he's warning the church, don't make your drifting feel safe because the tares are drifting
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.960]   with you.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.520]   Don't go down that path and think, well everybody is going down that path because everybody
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.720]   in the church is down that path.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:23.280]   He's warning the Christians in the midst of the tares that this is not for you.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   If you have tasted that the Lord is good, then come all the way to Christ.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:37.640]   Don't nibble at the world and don't nibble in the table of Christ and think somehow you're
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.000]   going to prove God wrong.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.720]   I will show him that it is possible to serve mammon and God at the same time.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.080]   And you will be proven wrong at the end.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.480]   And so that's why this text is here as a warning, as a wake up call, as he's been preaching
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.200]   for the last six chapters to take this warning seriously.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:07.380]   If you have been drifting and you have been feeling perfectly safe because you're surrounded
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:13.440]   by other friends who are also drifting, wake up.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.720]   Wake up.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.160]   Because the only standard he will measure us with is his word, the plumb line of his
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.900]   word.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.360]   Not by the standard of this church, not by the standard of the pastor, not by the standard
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.720]   of your small group leaders or your small group or your group of friends, but by the
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.760]   word of God and word of God alone.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:42.480]   And the point, the end point of all of this, the end point of all of this is that Christ
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.840]   is the only way.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.660]   Salvation is not found in small groups.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.400]   Salvation is not found with your mentors.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.680]   Salvation is not found in pastors.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   Salvation is not found in your experiences.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.600]   Salvation is not found in your education or your theology.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   Salvation is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.000]   Do you know this Christ?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.520]   Do you love this Christ?
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.480]   Do you follow this Christ?
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.440]   Do you worship this Christ?
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.160]   Are you somebody just enlightened?
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.760]   You've only just tasted.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.640]   You've only observed him.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.760]   You've given him a thumbs up.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.560]   You've okayed him, but you never rejected him.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.200]   But you don't know him either.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.600]   In Acts 4.12, "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:45.920]   Again I ask you, because to me, and I believe many pastors will agree with me, this is the
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.600]   primary problem where you and I live.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.340]   This is the primary problem.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.520]   This is the primary deception.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:05.020]   Church is filled with non-Christians feeling perfectly safe on their way to hell.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.160]   This is the primary problem.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.400]   It is not the government.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.120]   It is not the Democrats.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.940]   It is not the Republicans.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.860]   This is the primary problem.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.700]   The truth has been muddied by a nominal Christian environment.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.760]   And we have made our church our standard.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.600]   We have made our past our standard.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:32.040]   We have made our Christian friends our standard without ever knowing Christ.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.480]   So there is no joy in Christ in that.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.520]   There's no celebration.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.700]   There is no worship in that.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.200]   And that's why these trivial things in the church, trivial things in our life matter
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.840]   so much.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.760]   Because we don't know Christ.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.880]   My prayer is that you would know this Christ.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.080]   That you would be honest with yourself.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:01.680]   Know where you stand with God and come to Him all the way.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.200]   Don't just like Him from a distance.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   Don't just agree with Him from a distance.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.760]   In Matthew 13, 44-46, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.960]   a man found and hid again.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:24.360]   And from joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.200]   Do you know what he's talking about?
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.680]   Do you understand that joy of this farmer who found Christ and everything else became
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.440]   rubbish in light of that?
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.280]   Verse 45, again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.920]   And upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   it.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.080]   Do you understand this merchant?
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.920]   Do you understand why he would sell everything to get that pearl?
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:01.360]   Because he's tasted and all he wants now is more of it.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:12.560]   I pray, I pray that the deception of nominal Christianity would not cause you to be blind.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.640]   Don't compare with the person sitting to your left or to your right, behind you or in front
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.520]   of you.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.720]   Examine the word of God carefully.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:27.840]   Now, I don't want to finish this sermon with just yelling because I want you to understand
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.840]   the whole context.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.400]   I'm going to get to this part next week.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.960]   But the reason why he says it so strongly is because he's trying to get the wheat to
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.400]   come and to separate the tares.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.800]   But he says in verse 9, "But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.400]   you," and he's talking to the wheat now, "and things that accompany salvation, though we
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.640]   are speaking in this way.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.700]   For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:02.520]   his name in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints."
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.420]   In other words, all is not lost.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.900]   If you're a child of God, come.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.080]   If you've been drifting, come.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.580]   And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.440]   of hope until the end.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.000]   If your assurance is wavering because you've been wavering in your walk with Christ, he
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.320]   says make it sure by being diligent, committing to him, so that you will not be sluggish,
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:32.040]   but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.520]   I told you the whole chapter 6 is kind of like he's taking a break.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   He mentions Melchizedek.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.720]   He said, "I want to get to Melchizedek, but before I get to Melchizedek, I need your attention."
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.360]   Some of you have drifted and you've become hard of hearing and you're not able to listen,
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.680]   so pay attention, okay?
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.520]   Because I'm going to get you to the meat, but in order to get you to the meat, you need
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.040]   to recognize who you are, right?
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.400]   And then he's going to get to chapter 10.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:02.760]   Well, I'm not going to get to chapter 7 because I'm going on a break, okay?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.040]   But I'm going to finish chapter 6 before I go, okay?
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   So we'll get back to it.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.200]   It's going to be a long break, all right?
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:20.120]   So we're going to get to chapter 7, but before we get there, before we get there, I'm going
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.960]   to share with you a little bit more, hopefully a bit more personally, in the next couple
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.840]   of weeks.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:39.000]   Christ is everything.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.200]   He's everything.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.480]   I'm not just saying this because I'm a pastor.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.840]   I didn't want to be a pastor.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:53.800]   There's a lot of things about being a pastor I still don't like today.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:01.040]   But when I became a Christian, it was never a decision, like, "Are you going to tell other
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.040]   people about Christ?"
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   How is that a question?
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.960]   How do you meet the living God and the only way of salvation and believing what He has
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:19.400]   done for me in the world and to struggle with, "Should I tell this to other people?"
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   How is that even a question?
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.560]   That's not a question.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.920]   That's just something that happened to me.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.600]   It's not something that I did.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.160]   It's something that happened to me.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:35.960]   And the only reason why you and I are here is because of what He has done.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:43.840]   And the only reason why I persevere is because I want you to know this, Christ.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:54.580]   There's too many people in the church, maybe even in this church, you don't know Jesus.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.960]   You think you do, but you don't know Jesus.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.500]   And that's why you keep struggling with the same things over and over and over.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:12.000]   That's why the world is so important to you because you don't know Jesus.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.640]   And you're living under a deception because you've been in the church for so long that
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.440]   you're not allowed to examine your faith.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.640]   You were a leader at the church.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.000]   How can you examine your faith?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.780]   But unless we're honest with ourselves, you always appreciate Jesus.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:40.820]   You appreciate Him, but you'll never love Him because you don't know Him.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:51.220]   So my prayer for all of us, for every single person that I get to preach to every Sunday,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:57.500]   no matter how good of a job I package or not do a good job packaging, that beyond all of
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:03.260]   that, do you know this Jesus?
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.120]   I'm not asking do you serve this church.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.300]   I'm not asking do you give.
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.500]   I'm not asking how much Bible you know.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.380]   I'm asking you, do you know this Jesus?
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.580]   Let's go back to the basics, to the fundamentals.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:24.580]   Whether you've been a Christian for a year or decades, because until you know this Jesus,
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.980]   the scripture will not make any sense.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:39.420]   So my plea with you as I invite you to pray, if you've been living a nominal Christian
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:49.500]   life, you've been lukewarm for years, you are not safe.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.140]   You are not safe.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:57.460]   And so I pray that that passage would have spoken to you.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.300]   Separate from the tears.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:05.260]   Separate yourself from the tears and know the resurrected Christ.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.140]   Be honest with yourself.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:13.780]   That you may be able to confess with your own mouth that he came to give me life and
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.020]   give this life abundantly.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.580]   Let's pray.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:27.180]   Father, I pray for revival in this desert.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:37.860]   I pray for rain and for supernatural bread that we can only drink and eat of in Christ.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:46.820]   Lord, we are so distracted by trivial things that in the end we'll perish.
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:50.160]   Help us, Lord God.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:54.260]   Help us to labor for things that are eternal.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:52:02.620]   I pray for myself, that the hungering and thirsting for your righteousness would never
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.920]   diminish.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.860]   I pray for my brothers and sisters in the church who loves the world more than loving
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.940]   you.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:17.740]   Maybe because they have drifted, I pray that you would call them back to be anchored in
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:24.820]   Christ, to be able to confess with all their hearts, Lord God, that you are all in all.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:31.420]   And maybe for those, Lord God, who have been living in deception, that because they have
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:36.700]   been in church for so long, that though they do not know you, they've convinced themselves
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.260]   that that is enough.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:46.060]   I pray that the word that you give will not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.100]   Lord, the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.580]   We beseech you, Lord, to send more workers into the harvest.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.460]   May Christ and Christ alone be magnified.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.380]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
