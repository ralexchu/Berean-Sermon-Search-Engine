[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   [Intro Music]
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.840]   Colossians 1, 15-23 is a majestic text, in fact, it's my favorite text in the Bible.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.300]   But Colossians 1, 20 is notoriously challenging and it has baffled and befuddled Bible interpreters
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.980]   and theologians for many centuries.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.720]   The question comes in to us today from a listener named Heather.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.320]   "Hello Pastor John, I have a question about Colossians 1, 20 about Christ reconciling
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.480]   to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.080]   cross.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.120]   For the unsaved and for the fallen angels, how are they reconciled to Christ?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to Heather?"
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.480]   I just did a look at the book session on this very question recently, so let me see if I
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   can sum up my argument for Heather here on APJ.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.040]   It really matters, because it's a question about what's commonly called universalism,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.160]   or the teaching that in the end, everyone, even demons, will be saved.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.880]   There's no hell, there's no eternal punishment.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.360]   Sooner or later, even if it takes a thousand years through some kind of purgatorial discipline,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480]   everybody gets saved in the end.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   That's what some people say this text, this text, Colossians 1, 20, supports.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.160]   And let me read it.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   For in Christ all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:52.280]   to himself all things, to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.120]   making peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   The question is, when Paul says, "All things, all things will be reconciled to God through
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:12.600]   Christ," does "all things" mean every unbeliever who has ever lived, including Satan?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.560]   And my answer is no.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   But rather, "all things" is a comprehensive term referring to the new heavens and the
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   new earth, where absolutely everything, all things that exist in the new heavens and the
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.480]   new earth will have been reconciled to God through the blood of Christ.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:46.040]   But that there is over against that new heavens and new earth an outer darkness, an awayness,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.640]   an other.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.880]   There is a reality excluded from the new creation.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.320]   There is hell that's outside God's new creation where impenitent believers and demons suffer
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.920]   justly forever.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   Now here are four passages that point me to this understanding of Colossians 1:20.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.840]   Number one, 2 Thessalonians 1, 7-9, and these teach me that Paul just doesn't believe in
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.480]   universalism.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.360]   At the second coming, the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.520]   in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.600]   obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence of the
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.280]   Lord and from the glory of his might.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.400]   Now that passage shows that Paul does not believe all will be saved.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.440]   He believes that there will be an eternal destruction for those who disobey the gospel.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.520]   Paul does not believe that everyone will be reconciled to God.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.920]   Everyone will not be saved.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   And he says that they will suffer a punishment away, away from the presence of the Lord and
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   of his glory.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.680]   And that points, I think, to what I mean by outside of the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.280]   Now this next text, this is number two, supports that, I think.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.320]   Matthew 8-11, Jesus says, "Many will come from east and west and recline at table with
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.880]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.480]   be thrown into outer darkness."
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.440]   Outside the kingdom, away.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.840]   In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:03.600]   So what Paul calls "away from the Lord's glory," Jesus describes as that place which will be
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.080]   outside of the established kingdom of God at the end, outside of God's saving rule,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.760]   outside the place where all is reconciled, the place of outer darkness.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:27.200]   Third, remember in Colossians 1-20 that these all things that are going to be reconciled
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.360]   are things on earth and things in heaven.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   Now why doesn't Paul say all things under the earth?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.360]   All things in heaven, all things on earth, all things under the earth.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.760]   Because he uses those three in Philippians 2-10, where he says, "At the name of Jesus,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.360]   every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth."
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.080]   And that phrase is not used in Colossians 1-20.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.560]   Now when he uses it in Philippians 2-10, he's not saying there's universal salvation, but
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.360]   universal submission.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.640]   Willingly or unwillingly, every knee is going to bow, including the demons under the earth.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.360]   Could it be, could it be that Paul did not use the phrase "under the earth" in Colossians
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   1-20 because those under the earth will not be reconciled to God?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.240]   They're not part of the all things.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.640]   They will have to submit, but they will not be reconciled.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.720]   Now here's my last text, and a very, very important observation, I think.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.360]   This is a principled analogy.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.800]   I'm thinking of Isaiah 66-24.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.400]   Those are the very last verses of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:01.020]   And the point of this text is simply to illustrate how careful one has to be in taking a phrase
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.560]   like "all things" and assuming it includes what it does not include.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.360]   Here's what it says in verse 22.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.480]   "As the new heavens and the new earth, as the new heavens and the new earth that I make,
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.280]   shall remain before me, says the Lord, so shall your offspring and your name remain."
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.620]   Verse 23, "From new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh," there's the
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:39.860]   phrase, "all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the Lord."
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   Now if we stopped right there, after verse 23, we might say, "There it is!
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.740]   That's Colossians 1-20, right?
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.220]   All things are going to be reconciled.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   Everybody's worshiping.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.580]   All flesh is worshiping."
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.240]   Here's the problem.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.440]   The next verse goes like this, which is verse 24.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:05.640]   "And they," that is the all flesh, "they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.340]   men who have rebelled against me.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:16.760]   For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.240]   to all flesh."
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:28.080]   Now I think this is clear, and what is clear is that all flesh, like all things in Colossians
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:35.380]   1-20, all flesh in the new creation does not include the flesh of those who have rebelled
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.600]   against God.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   What all flesh means in Isaiah 66-23 is the totality of humanity in the new heavens and
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.640]   the new earth.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.600]   There will be nothing and no one there who does not joyfully worship God.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.520]   Rebels will be outside, away from the glory of the Lord, and that's what I think Colossians
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.880]   1-20 means as well.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.720]   That is a worthy stab at a very baffling text.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.280]   And thanks for the question, Heather.
