[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Hello church family, my name is Jennifer Lin and I'm a second year student at UC Irvine.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.640]   Today I have the privilege to share my testimony.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.480]   I was born and raised in Taiwan for 14 years and I did not hear about the story of Jesus
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.640]   not until I was a second grader.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.360]   One time my mom's friend invited her and my family to her church and that was my first
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   time being exposed to a Christian community.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.840]   I did not seem to like the community at first because I did not understand why people were
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.740]   so serious and were worshipping this God who they call Abba Father.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.980]   I would not, I would only go to church for Sunday schools to hear interesting Bible stories
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.640]   and enjoy yummy candies.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.240]   As I stayed with the church longer I saw something different among the people who are called
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.840]   Christians.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   They were extremely kind and loving towards others, making me curious and wanting to know
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.040]   who this God is and what makes them this way.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.120]   When I was still in Taiwan I feel ashamed when people ask me if I went to church.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.160]   I think about moving to the United States where Christianity is the main religion excited
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   me.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.360]   Moving to the US as a freshman in high school I had so much love for this Christ who I did
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.400]   not know really well but was excited to know and I was also excited to be a part of a church
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.560]   family.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.320]   I attended my own church and was convinced that I was a Christian with my shallow knowledge
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240]   of God and was baptized in December 2015.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.480]   Right now looking back I do not believe that I was saved.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.920]   When people ask me I would tell them that I'm Christian but in real life I only attended
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.780]   church occasionally and lived life for myself like the rest of the world.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.160]   I did not know who this God really is and did not have a personal relationship with
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   him.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.480]   All I knew about the gospel was only half true that God loves me and that's all.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.320]   And I continued to go after the world and put my hope in all temporary worldly desires.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   In December 2018 during my senior year of high school I went into a three month period
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.660]   of depression without telling anyone.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.960]   I lost hope, cried to sleep every day and did not know how to ask for help.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.400]   One night while I was crying to sleep and at the lowest point thinking about death I
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.960]   hear the voice from above God say to me, "Jen I love you."
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   It was a heartwarming and touching experience.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.180]   That was my first time hearing the voice of God and I prayed to God and surrendered my
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.040]   life to him for help right after.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.840]   Immediately God opened my heart the next day and I finally shared my thoughts and what
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.600]   I was going through with one of my close friends who also happened to be a Christian.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.700]   She encouraged me and prayed for me.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.000]   This made me hungry and thirst to learn more about Christianity and the love of God.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.640]   Coming into UCI I was hoping to find a Christian community where I could grow spiritually and
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   learn more about this God.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.240]   By the grace of God I was introduced to Berean Community Church during my second quarter
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   at UCI.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   I saw a group of genuine believers who lived their lives glorifying to God.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.160]   I was encouraged and rebuked at the same time after learning more about the biblical truth
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.520]   and getting to know these godly individuals and seeing how humble they are recognizing
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.040]   their own weaknesses and sin and repent.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   For the very first time I learned the complete version of the gospel.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.080]   In Romans 5, 8, but God demonstrate his own love towards us.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.440]   In that while we were yes sinners God, Christ died for us.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.280]   This was also the first time I learned about the importance of devotion and prayer and
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.880]   had started to take these steps for my spiritual growth.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   Going into quarantine was a challenge to my still growing faith.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.080]   I was hopeless about the uncertainty and felt discontent not being able to see people in
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   person.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.000]   Through the Bible study on the book of Philippians and first Corinthians I learned that the Lord
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.400]   is the only source of joy, hope, and peace and everything else in this world is just
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.600]   material and will one day fade away.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.160]   Through the Holy Spirit my eyes were opened and led me to genuine surrender and repentance.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.720]   Ever since then my joy and contentment are only found in Christ and Christ alone and
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.360]   I'm able to recognize the godly within versus the worthy within.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.880]   Throughout my life there are so many ups and downs but I know that these are all God's
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   grace.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   I'm super thankful that God prunes me and reveals my sinfulness and pride through them
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.800]   all to make me come to an understanding of how my life is truly about.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.560]   He always closes doors and opens even better ones for me.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.000]   I once was lost but now I'm found.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.960]   I once was a slave to sin but it was only through the blood of Christ my sins are forgiven
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.520]   and an eternal life was given.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.600]   I will still sin in the future but I will not destined grow to be a hobbit.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.000]   I will strive to kill sin and pursue a life of holiness.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.640]   It is no longer who I live but Christ who lives in me.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.200]   I want to know God more and make him known.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Thank you.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   [applause]
