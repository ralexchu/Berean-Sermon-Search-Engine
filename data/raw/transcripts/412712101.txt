[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Good morning.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.200]   If you've been following us in our worship, we've been in the series of the I Am Statements
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   of Christ.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.280]   There are seven specific ones.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.840]   And we talked about Jesus as the bread of life.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.300]   We talked about Jesus as the light of the world.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.320]   And then during Easter, we talked about Jesus as the resurrection and the life.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.560]   So we're going to be covering chapter 10, but it's really connected to chapter 9.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.520]   And it has to be understood together because chapter 10 is spoken of in the context of
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.340]   what happens in chapter 9.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.520]   And so we have the two statements of Jesus where he says, "I am the door and I am the
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.960]   good shepherd."
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.680]   And so let me read the passage where he states that in John chapter 10, verse 7, and John
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.760]   chapter 10, verse 11, and then we'll jump into the text this morning.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.440]   John chapter 10, verse 7, "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.280]   of the sheep.'"
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440]   Then John chapter 10, 11, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.160]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.360]   Let's pray.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.120]   Father, we pray that your word would speak to us.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.840]   Help us to have a deepening understanding of Christ and that in light of the surpassing
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.320]   knowledge of knowing him better, that all these other things, Lord God, that easily
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.800]   entangles us and tempts us would truly become rubbish.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.240]   Help us, Lord, to see a greater vision of the glory of Christ, that our eyes may be
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.520]   opened, that we may see the light, and that Christ and Christ alone would be our treasure
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.120]   and our goal.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   So we ask for your anointing this time, this morning, that our worship may be given to
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.440]   you in a way that honors and glorifies you.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   Amen.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   So again, as I said, chapter 10, these two statements, the "I am" statements, really
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.500]   ought to be understood together.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.180]   So if you've read chapter 10 before this morning or you've studied it before, you may have
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.080]   noticed that in chapter 10, the "I am the door" and "I am the good shepherd" is really
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   used interchangeably.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.520]   So it's hard to dissect, is he talking about the door, is he talking about the shepherd?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.400]   Because again, you'll see better what he means by that by really looking at chapter 9.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.520]   In fact, if you don't look at chapter 9, what Jesus says about the door is really not going
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.160]   to make a lot of sense.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.000]   We can understand Jesus as a good shepherd, right?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.840]   He's a shepherd, we are the sheep, he guides us, he leads us, feeds us, we understand that
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.040]   aspect of it, or it's easier to understand.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.120]   But what is the statement of "I am the door"?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.800]   So again, if you don't understand the context in which he says that, the "I am the door"
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.960]   statement, it really is just going to go over your head and say, "Well, Jesus says he's
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.560]   the door, so we trust him."
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.520]   But what does he mean by that?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.440]   How did the first recipients understood this statement?
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   In order to do that, we have to look at the event in chapter 9, because that statement
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.640]   is said right after this event.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   And so what happens in chapter 9?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.640]   So what I ask you to do, because there's too many verses, I don't have the text that's
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.220]   going to be written on the screen, so if you have your Bibles, I ask that you would open
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.000]   up to John chapter 9 and just keep it there, because I'm going to be reading the narrative,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.720]   parts of it together with you, and then when we get to the three-point meaning of "I am
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.520]   the door" and "I am the good shepherd," it'll be easier to follow and the text will be coming
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   up for you.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   So let's look at John chapter 9.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200]   What happens here that sets up for his statement, "I am the door"?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   John chapter 9 verse 1, it says, "As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth, and his
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.320]   disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   blind?'"
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   So let me stop right there.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.400]   So the setup of the story is that they run into this blind man, and you can see by the
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.440]   attitude of the disciples, the very first question that they ask, which was not unique
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.360]   to the disciples, the whole Jewish community believed that if you had any kind of defect
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.880]   or if you were struggling, that it must have been because you're being punished by God
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.380]   for some kind of sin, and that was their initial first response.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:15.160]   And you can understand if that was their attitude toward the blind, there was no benevolence
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.720]   program for them because they believed you deserved it.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.460]   In fact, you know, in many cultures around the world, unlike the Judeo-Christian culture,
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.580]   they believe that if you're suffering, if you're poor, if some affliction happened to
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.540]   you, you must have done something maybe in your previous life, and you need to pay off
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.080]   your sins in order for you to progress into the next life.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.980]   Many cultures, they actually speak against helping the poor because they must be poor
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.700]   for a reason.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.800]   Well, the Jewish culture was very similar to that.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.660]   Not only did they have the physical hardship, they believed that if something bad happened
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.340]   to you, you must have done something, and that's why they were asking a question, not
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.640]   unique to the disciples, but the Jewish culture itself.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   So you can imagine as a blind person, hard enough, your life is hard enough as it is,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.560]   but that the people around you in society, every time you came around, it's like, "Look
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   at that guy.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.880]   He must have done something."
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.200]   And that's the question that is asked, and Jesus answers in verse 3, "It was neither
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.600]   that this man has sinned, nor his parents, but it was so that the works of God might
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.000]   be displayed in him."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.880]   Remember, Jesus says the same thing in John chapter 11 about Lazarus' death.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.640]   He said that God allowed to happen because God has a specific plan.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.260]   So Jesus, obviously, you know the story about how he spits on the ground and takes mud and
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.200]   puts it on his eyes and tells him to go and wash at the pool of Siloam.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.280]   Then he comes back and he sees.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.920]   And then when people see it, they're obviously surprised.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.080]   Wasn't this man the same guy who used to beg at the temple day in and day out?
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   How was he able to see?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.160]   So some people didn't believe him.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.440]   Some people said that maybe it was somebody that looked like him.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.580]   And then he begins to speak up.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.380]   And he says, "I am the one," in verse 9, to confirm.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.600]   So you can imagine he opens his eyes and he's excited to go see people.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.240]   And then people are like, "No, that can't be you.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.480]   How can that have possibly happened?"
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.580]   So again, all of this is a setup of what's going to happen in chapter 10.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.840]   We get to verse 13.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.240]   And so some people are shocked.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.280]   Some people are praising God.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.940]   Some people don't believe.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.960]   But look at the response of the Pharisees, the leaders, in verse 13.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.080]   They brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.200]   Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made this clay and opened his eyes.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.400]   Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received the sight.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.640]   And he said to them, "He applied clay to my eyes and I washed it and I see."
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   And look at verse 16, what they say.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God because he does
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.120]   not keep the Sabbath."
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.300]   A miracle takes place.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.700]   A man who was blind all his life that was a common figure at the temple gate.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.180]   And there's clear evidence that his eyes are open.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.140]   But their first response is, "Because Jesus doesn't jump through the hoops the way we
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.780]   ask our people to.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.780]   He didn't keep the Sabbath."
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.060]   And again, Jesus never broke the Sabbath command of God.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.460]   He broke the Sabbath that they created.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.020]   That they created.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.040]   All the extra laws that they created.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.780]   So if he doesn't abide by us, he can't possibly be from God.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.860]   That's basically what they're saying.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.340]   If he doesn't submit to us, even if he performs a miracle, he's not from God.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.700]   Because clearly I'm the one anointed by God so therefore if you don't submit to me, you
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.820]   must not be from God.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.980]   That's basically what they're saying.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.420]   "The document who is a sinner performed such signs and there was a division among them.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.780]   So they said to the blind man again, 'What do you say about him since he opened your
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.780]   eyes?'
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.900]   And he said, 'He is a prophet.'"
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.900]   Verse 18.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.320]   "The Jews then did not believe it of him that he had been blind and had received sight until
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.580]   they called the parents the very one who had received his sight."
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.340]   So obviously you're a sinner.
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.580]   We can't trust what you say.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.860]   Jesus doesn't submit to us so therefore he must not be from God.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.700]   So we're going to investigate a little further and we're going to call his parents.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.820]   Now understand the blind man's relationship with the parents.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.260]   Typically at that time if you were blind, there was no social program to take care of
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.380]   you and other people would look at the blind man and say, "Remember the question that they
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.380]   asked?
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.780]   Was it his sin?
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.380]   And what was the other question?
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.440]   Or was it his parents?"
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.560]   So to have a blind son in the house would invite ridicule from the society that they
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   belong to.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.800]   So the typical practice was to release them to live with other blind people.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.540]   And that's probably why he was begging at the temple gate because his parents weren't
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.300]   taking care of him.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.680]   And his parents show up because they, for the purpose of indicting Jesus, they call
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.920]   him, them in and they ask them, "Your son clearly wasn't blind because this sinner,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.120]   Jesus, could not have performed this miracle."
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.800]   In verse 20, "His parents answered them and said, 'We know that this is our son and that
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.120]   he was born blind.'"
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.280]   In other words, I can't lie to you, right?
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   That's what he was.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.080]   In verse 20, "But how he now sees, we do not know.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.880]   Or who opened his eyes, we do not know.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.520]   Ask him, he is of age, he will speak for himself."
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.340]   Now let me stop right there, okay?
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.960]   Because what they say in the next text is really the setup of what Jesus says in verse
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.760]   10, verse 22.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.280]   "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.320]   For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed him to be Christ, he was to be put
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.720]   out of the synagogue."
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.120]   Okay, stop right there.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   The Pharisees were the leaders of the synagogue.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.400]   Now understand what the synagogue was.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   The temple was God-ordained where people were to come give sacrifices.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.160]   But because of the diaspora of the Jews, they were spread all over the known world at that
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   time, they had to find a way to worship God.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.340]   So what they did was, their law was wherever there was 10 men, Jewish men, they were given
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.200]   permission to set up a synagogue, sort of a mini-temple.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.600]   And so through that synagogue, they would perform the worships and various things that
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.060]   they needed to do, but the major sacrifice, they still needed to come to the temple.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.260]   So the temple was ruled by the Sanhedrin and the high priest.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.640]   But the synagogues were ruled by the Pharisees, and that's where majority of the Jews practiced
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.360]   their faith.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.440]   So for the leaders of Israel to say, "If you don't agree with us, if you don't submit to
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   us, if you don't agree that this man clearly is a sinner because he's calling us out, so
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   we're calling him out.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.260]   If you take his side," he said, "we're going to kick you out of the synagogue."
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.100]   And so in fear of being kicked out of the synagogue, they basically were plain dumb.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.060]   "Well, he's our son, we can't deny that he was born blind, but as to how his eyes were
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.260]   open, we can't say."
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.420]   Now again, it's helpful for us to understand what the synagogue meant for an average Jew.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.820]   Because the synagogue was not just a place where you went to worship.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.020]   Synagogue was your community.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.060]   Synagogue was where your children were educated.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.520]   That was also your school.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.460]   Synagogue was where you went and you probably married within that context.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.740]   So synagogue to them was their world.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.740]   So if you were kicked out of the synagogue, not only would you have spiritual ramification,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.700]   not only would you have ramification for the education of your children, you wouldn't be
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.220]   able to do any kind of business.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.360]   Because anybody who does business with that person, anybody who supports that person,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.520]   anybody who relates to that person would also be kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.260]   So they had this tight rein, they had this power over the synagogue, and these men basically
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.240]   were saying, "We've labeled him to be a troublemaker, and he's a sinner.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.100]   So anybody who supports him in any way will be kicked out of the synagogue."
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.000]   Now all of that was a setup to verse chapter 10.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.540]   For this reason, verse 23, the parents said, "He's of age, ask him."
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.540]   So the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, "Give glory
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.340]   to God, we know that this man is a sinner."
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.740]   He then answered, "Whether he's a sinner, I do not know.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.700]   One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.460]   Verse 26, "So they said to him, 'What did he do to you?
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.540]   How did he open your eyes?'
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.620]   He answered him, 'I told you already.'"
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.300]   You can kind of see he knows that he's not going to get through to them.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.660]   What he's telling them, "I already told you that I was born blind.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.300]   My parents told you I was born blind, and I see.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.060]   Clearly you're not going to accept my answer.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.740]   He said, 'I already told you, and you did not listen.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.620]   Why do you want to hear it again?
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.380]   You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?'"
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.380]   Sarcasm.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.220]   So if you don't know what sarcasm is, right there, lesson one, that's sarcasm.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.060]   I mean, think about this man's position.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:28.280]   He was born blind all his life, and his lot in life was to be a beggar all his life.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:34.960]   So can you imagine not being able to see and hearing the whole community of people going
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.700]   back and forth into the temple with their animals to sacrifice?
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.820]   Families, husband and wives, laughing with their children, going back and forth.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   So can you imagine him being forced to be on the side of the street begging all of his
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.500]   life?
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.620]   So for him to open his eyes wasn't simply that, "Now I can see and function like a normal
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.420]   person."
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.660]   For a blind man, a Jewish blind man, to have his eyes open means that he can enter back
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.660]   into society.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:13.300]   And in order to enter back into society, he needed the approval of these Pharisees.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.500]   So you can see the boldness of this man.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.940]   Now he's standing against these Pharisees who really hold the key, at least humanly
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.900]   speaking, for a good life for him.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.860]   He may be able to, he'll always be known as that guy who used to beg and God perform miracle
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.860]   on him.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:35.640]   He's able to now find a wife possibly, have children, get a normal job, be able to worship
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.780]   at the synagogue, raise his children.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.660]   He must have had all of those thoughts in his head.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.580]   But he's standing before these men who have the key to good life for him, and now he realizes
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.980]   that he's not going to get through to them.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.660]   So he's basically challenging them.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.900]   Why are you so stubborn and why do you refuse to see this?
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.060]   In verse 30, "The man answered and said to them, 'Well, here is an amazing thing that
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.940]   you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.'"
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.540]   We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.540]   he hears him.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.180]   "Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.160]   the person born blind.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.240]   If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.440]   And they answered him, 'You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?'
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.140]   So they put him out."
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.800]   Look at that conversation.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.400]   Here's a man, if he was blind, he probably had never had any kind of education, never
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.880]   had any kind of training.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   He was a beggar all his life since he was a young child, and yet he's the one trying
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.400]   to open their eyes spiritually.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.320]   So he may have been the one physically blind all his life, but spiritually he was seeing
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   clearly.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   And here's these men who had the access to his word, who were the teachers of the law
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.780]   at the synagogue, who were the leaders of the spiritual community, and yet they did
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.140]   not understand what was plainly in front of them.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.200]   And as a result of challenging these people, they did exactly what everybody was afraid
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.920]   of, what his parents were afraid of.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   They put him out.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.400]   And it is in this context that Jesus meets up with this man who's just been put out.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.520]   He now sees, but because he can't participate in society, he may still have to beg.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.420]   He's not going to be able to get a job.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.980]   He's not going to be able to go to the synagogue.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.700]   He won't be welcomed at the temple.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.640]   And Jesus meets him in verse 35.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.680]   Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.980]   Son of Man?"
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.500]   He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.480]   Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and he is the one who is talking with you."
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.920]   And he said, "Lord, I believe."
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   And he worshipped him.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.440]   And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   see, and those who may see may become blind."
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.540]   And then in verse 40, "Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.200]   to him, 'We are not blind too, are we?'
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.180]   Jesus said to them, 'If you were blind, you would have no sin.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.880]   But since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.'"
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.440]   All of that was an introduction.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.360]   Because it's difficult to understand what he says in the next statement without understanding
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.380]   chapter 9.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:32.000]   When he says he is the door, now I hope you're already thinking, I hope you're already making
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.440]   the connection.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.680]   When he's saying, "I am the door," he's saying the Jews are not.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.640]   And that's why chapter 1, chapter 10, verse 1, begins with an indictment of the Jewish
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.800]   leaders that they are not the door to eternal life.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   That they are not the door.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.600]   The synagogue is not the door for your refuge and your safety.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.760]   So what I want to do, again, these three observations of what Jesus says in chapter 10 about these
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.840]   two statements, about him being the door and the shepherd.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.840]   And I'm using it interchangeably because that's how it's used in chapter 10.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.680]   And it's all as in response to the Jewish leaders kicking out this blind man for stating
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.720]   the truth.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.640]   First thing that he says, an indictment against the Jews, "Jesus is the owner and not a hired
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   hand."
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.760]   Again, this is an indictment against the leaders.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.200]   Verse 10, chapter 10, verse 1, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:37.240]   door into the fold of the sheep but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber."
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.760]   Now, who is he referring to?
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.960]   Clearly, he's talking about the Pharisees.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.720]   He's talking about these leaders.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.560]   That they are standing in the position of proclaiming the word of God, but they were
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.440]   never appointed by God himself.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.600]   They were thieves who didn't come through the door and they basically forced their way
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.640]   into leadership.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.520]   Now, all throughout Israel's history, one of the primary indictments against the nation
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.600]   of Israel almost always started with the leaders going astray.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.040]   People that God did not anoint speaking.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.720]   The people that God did not call self-willed themselves.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:24.120]   Maybe through some family ties, maybe through some sort of revolt, maybe through education,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.600]   maybe through talent, but it wasn't God-ordained.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.760]   In fact, if you want to read details about that, Jeremiah is a really good book to see
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.800]   what God thinks of Israel's leaders.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.680]   Because the passage that I'm going to read to you, you can find it in dozens and dozens
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.880]   and dozens of other passages, but I'm going to choose only one for the sake of time.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.620]   Jeremiah 14, 14, "Then the Lord said to me, 'The prophets are prophesying falsehood in
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.200]   my name.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.040]   I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.320]   They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, futility, and a deception of
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.720]   their own mind.'"
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.440]   In other words, they're thinking to themselves, "What should I say?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360]   What can I say?"
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.240]   Instead of speaking the truth, they're speaking what they think is important, what maybe you
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   want to hear.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.840]   That's exactly what Paul says to Timothy, that in times that people aren't going to
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.640]   want to hear the truth.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.000]   Sometimes the truth is encouraging and sometimes the truth is cutting.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.520]   He said, "They're not going to put up with the cutting part and they're going to gather
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.720]   around themselves leaders who want to tickle their itching ears."
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.920]   And this was not a problem only of the end times.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.920]   We see in the Old Testament, this was a continual problem with the nation of Israel.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   These false teachers were forcing their way into leadership and they weren't speaking
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.000]   for God.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   He says that they have come to rob and to steal.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   In Matthew 7, 15, "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.960]   are ravenous wolves."
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   Well, how are they thieves?
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.120]   Well first of all, they're thieves because they rob God of his glory.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:15.400]   The reason why they jump in and try to be leaders is for self-exaltation, self-glorification.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.640]   Even though they talk about God, ultimately it's about themselves.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.920]   They're not willing to be in the back.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920]   They're not willing to serve.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.760]   They're not willing to be in the shadows.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:31.800]   Their primary reason to be leader is so that they can rob God of his glory in the name
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.520]   of Christ.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.560]   But they also rob people of access to truth and to God's glory.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.000]   So not only do they rob God, they rob the sheep because they stand in a place where
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.960]   they supposedly speak for God, but ultimately bring glory to themselves.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   In fact, it goes a bit further in John 10, 12-13.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.120]   It says, "He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep,"
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.460]   again, the Israel's leaders, "sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.780]   And the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.080]   He flees because he is a hired hand and he's not concerned about the sheep."
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.640]   In other words, what he is saying is you're not safe under their leadership because they're
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.600]   there for themselves.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:25.520]   So if you being there helps them, then they might be benevolent.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.880]   They might be there serving you.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.640]   But as soon as his life is in danger, as soon as it doesn't benefit him, he packs up and
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.080]   he leaves.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.360]   So in other words, he's warning them, you're not safe there.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.240]   Now why is he saying this?
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.920]   Because of what just happened in chapter 9.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:49.440]   The nation of Israel was living in fear of being kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.880]   And so they were jumping over hoops, obeying all of these laws.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:01.160]   And many of them probably were looking at this and said, "Well, the Sabbath law is ridiculous.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:07.760]   That we can walk 300 feet, but as soon as we walk 301 feet, we broke the Sabbath?
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.920]   That we can feed the donkey, but we can't feed the poor man?
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.000]   These laws don't make any sense.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.200]   But if you went against the leadership and you questioned them, you get kicked out of
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.240]   the synagogue and basically your life is ruined."
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.680]   And that's why the first thing that he does, he brings indictment against the nation of
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.880]   Israel.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   That's not where life is.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:36.760]   See, shepherds who don't have ownership and who are only there for his own glory, when
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.440]   the wolf comes, he will flee.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.680]   They don't ache for the people.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.440]   They don't cry out for those who are hurting or drifting.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.720]   They've never had compassion for the lost.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.160]   It was just a legalistic duty.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.720]   And it was, you know, one way to bring glory to himself is to go out into the world, make
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.420]   a lot of money, become famous.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:03.360]   Or another way to do that is become a leader in the church, get a good reputation, have
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.840]   many people who may honor you.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.680]   They're seeking their self-glory, except they're just doing it in the church.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.080]   We have countless, countless examples throughout church history, how the church became corrupt
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.000]   because of these false leaders.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.500]   In contrast, we see Jesus in Matthew 9, 36, seeing the people, he felt compassion for
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.620]   them because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.220]   In other words, why did he feel compassion?
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.800]   Jesus had compassion because those sheep were his.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.380]   They weren't just bad news that he was seeing on television.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.380]   You know, like you can hear horrific things and say, "Oh, I feel bad."
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.140]   And then you just press dislike.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.580]   But that's usually where it ends because we don't have a personal connection with that.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.420]   But it's a whole different story when it's our kids, when it's my uncle, when it's my
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.100]   dad, my brother.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.820]   So Jesus says he had compassion because he's a true shepherd.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.340]   And those are his sheep, John 10, 2-3.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.760]   But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.500]   To him, the doorkeeper opens.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.960]   In other words, God has an ordained path.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.340]   And you know that he's the shepherd because God has been preparing for him to come for
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.340]   generations.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:33.500]   He sent magi, prophets, angels, and even John the Baptist to go ahead of him, prepare, and
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.020]   to ordain so that the door that Jesus comes through may be wide open.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.680]   And the reason why he's saying that is you will recognize who the good shepherd is because
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.340]   he will come through the door that has been opened by God himself.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.580]   And that's the reason that we see in Matthew 3-15 when John the Baptist, whose whole purpose
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.620]   was to prepare the way for the coming of Christ, Jesus comes out.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.500]   And what's the first thing that he does before he enters ministry?
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.060]   He gets baptized by John the Baptist.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.220]   John the Baptist looks at him and says, "My whole ministry was to prepare for you.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.700]   I'm unworthy to even untie your sandals.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.060]   Why would I be baptized by you?"
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.780]   And he says, "This must be done to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.100]   In other words, Jesus himself was coming through the front door.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.500]   He was coming through the door that was prepared by the prophets, the magi, the angels, and
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.160]   John the Baptist.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.380]   So when you see the Son of Man coming through the door that God had opened, you know that
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.080]   that was the good shepherd that God had prepared.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:47.580]   Number two, not only is he the owner, Jesus knows his sheep and his sheep know him.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:54.340]   In John 10-5, "To him the doorkeeper opens and the sheep hear his voice and he calls
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.780]   his own sheep by name and leads them out."
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:04.780]   Now I have a really, I think, appropriate video that I want you to watch and it's only
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.940]   about a minute and a half.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.900]   So if we can watch that for a minute before I jump back in.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:38.900]   [ Music ]
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   [ Music ]
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.900]   >> Okay, let me stop right there.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.400]   All right.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:11.100]   For those of you who are here who didn't hear the sound, okay, basically the three children were trying
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.520]   to get the attention of the sheep and the sheep don't recognize the voice, so they don't move.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   But you notice when the farmer, the shepherd comes, the owner, and he begins to make sound,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.080]   if you could see it, the sheep all of a sudden perk up.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.820]   As soon as they hear his voice, they perk up and you can see all of them just kind of perking up
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.600]   and then he begins to call and they all just kind of swarm at him.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:38.180]   All right, so Jesus knowing the context of the farmers, the agriculture culture
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.940]   that people would have easily understood, he's using that as saying,
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:48.440]   he says when the true shepherd comes, you will be able to recognize his voice.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.200]   In verse 4, when he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.500]   and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.520]   A stranger they simply will not follow but will flee from him
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.220]   because they do not know the voice of the stranger.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.420]   And he repeatedly says he knows them, he knows them, they know him, they know him.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.360]   And the word know here isn't talking about knowledge.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.880]   The sheep didn't raise their head and say, huh, he's wearing that same jacket, you know.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.380]   Everything that we know about this man, he seems to fit that knowledge.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.820]   He's not talking about an academic knowledge of the shepherd.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:31.100]   He's not talking about that he had written bio, a resume of all of his sheep.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   He's talking about an intimate relationship, a personal intimate knowledge of each sheep.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.880]   And so he knows them and they know him and the Bible says that.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.600]   He said he counts every hair on our head.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   You know, if somebody says something like that to me, if another human being says that to me,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.980]   I know your sentiment but it's a hyperbole, right, it's an exaggeration.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.940]   There's no way you know the number of hair on my head.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.680]   I mean, I don't know how many are going to fall off today.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.740]   So there's no way you would know, right.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.980]   But when God says, I know every strand of hair on your head,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.720]   you know that he knows the exact number.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.740]   He knows. He knows when we were born.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.640]   He knows when we're going to die.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.300]   He knows what kind of life we're going to live.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.480]   He knows what kind of sickness.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.460]   He knows our hardship.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.400]   He knows our anxieties.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.160]   He knows our fears.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.000]   He knows when we're full.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.800]   He knows when we're hungry.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.020]   He knows when we're dejected.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.560]   He knows when we feel hopeless.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.700]   He knows when we're caught in a trap of our sins.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.900]   And he knows how to lead us out of that.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.720]   That's what he means when he says he knows his sheep.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.440]   He knows us well.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.580]   He's not some stranger standing far off making loud noises.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.160]   Say, if you hear his noise, come to me.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.360]   He says no.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.620]   He knows us.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.500]   He knows our struggles and he approaches us.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.640]   And that's why he says, my sheep know me.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.260]   They know my voice and they follow.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.340]   Why do they follow?
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.080]   Because when we hear his voice,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.160]   why do the sheep follow the shepherd's voice and not the other children?
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.100]   Because that shepherd is the one who feeds them.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.900]   That shepherd is the one who takes care of them.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.260]   In Mark chapter 13, 22, it says, for false cries and false prophets will arise
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.840]   and will show signs and wonders in order to lead astray,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.260]   if possible, the elect.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.480]   You know why he says if possible?
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Because he's saying it's not possible.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.820]   In other words, there's going to be a lot of people who may pose to be the elect,
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.400]   but when the true deception comes, they may also fall.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.180]   But they're not the true elect.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.240]   That's what he means by that.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:54.080]   Because those who are of his, when they hear their savior's voice, they recognize him.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.880]   Just even application of our own lives.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.840]   How did you come to Christ?
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.480]   In some way, in some form, whether it was preaching from the pulpit,
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.960]   whether it was somebody who shared with you one on one,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.200]   maybe some of you heard the gospel from somebody out on the street.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.080]   Maybe you just read a book about the gospel.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.320]   Maybe you went to a conference.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.920]   We don't know.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.880]   But at some point, all of us heard his voice.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.960]   And we recognized him as our shepherd.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.640]   And we believed.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.760]   You didn't go to three, four years of apologetic classes.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.840]   You didn't understand your faith that you do now about how the Bible came to us
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.320]   and the fulfilled prophecies and God's inerrant word, his own very breath
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.440]   and experiences that you've had with Christ.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.040]   You didn't have knowledge of all of that.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.640]   But somehow, you heard his voice and you recognized that he's your maker.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.480]   You recognized the shepherd's voice, and that's why we followed him.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.400]   Even as he told us to pick up our cross, even as hardship came into our lives.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.080]   We recognize his voice and we follow him.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.280]   That's why the primary goal of the church, the primary goal of the under
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.560]   shepherd is to make his voice clear.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.680]   If I stand up here for years and years and tell you because I live longer than
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   you, that you should listen to me, I'm telling you, don't listen to me.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.480]   I'm telling you right off the bat.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.080]   Don't listen to me.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.320]   If I stand here and say, because I've been a pastor and I've been leading a
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.720]   church for almost 30 years, I have much more experience than you, so you need to
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.760]   listen to me, don't listen to me.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.440]   Because there's people who've done ministry 50 years more than I did.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.360]   Maybe not 50 years, that'd be a long time, right?
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.040]   Or 50 years compared to my 30 years.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.920]   So then you should listen to him.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.000]   Oh, I went to seminary and I had education.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.320]   Well, somebody has a PhD, then you should listen to him.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.400]   No matter if I put my own personal experience and my own talent, my own
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.280]   gift, and my own education as the authority that you ought to follow, you
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:11.840]   should not follow because the primary goal of the church is to make his voice
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.720]   clear because the primary goal of every Christian is to follow the shepherd, not
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.480]   the under shepherd, not the leadership.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.520]   The goal of the leadership is to point you to the true shepherd Christ.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:31.520]   If our goal is to have the best organized church, then we should hire MBAs, you
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.920]   know, people who've studied and got their masters and how to milk the most
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.800]   productiveness out of the church.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:44.120]   If the goal of the church is branding, we want people to know who we are and we
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.840]   want, when we say Berean, we want the whole world to know who we are, then we
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.600]   should consult Coca-Cola, you know, in our generation, they did the best job, right?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.000]   Or Facebook, we should get people who are experts in branding.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.280]   If we want to make the greatest impact in our society to influence people by what
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.920]   we think is important, then we should get influencers, right?
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.160]   Social media influencers.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.600]   So if they have 30,000 followers or a million followers, we should recruit some
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.080]   of these people and spend some of our money asking them to help us be a better
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.920]   influence because somehow they figured it out.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.400]   But if our goal is to get to God, the most important thing that the church needs to
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:32.680]   do is to make his voice clear so that his sheep will hear his voice and continue to
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.480]   follow him.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.600]   That's the goal of the church.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   So even if all other parts of the church isn't running well, and I'm not saying
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   that we shouldn't run it well, I'm not saying we shouldn't have influence, but
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.320]   the primary and the most important and the greatest task that we need to give all our
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.760]   energy to, our finance to, is to make sure that our shepherd's voice is made clear.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:04.000]   All the more, as you and I are in a situation in a world pandemic, you know, I
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.920]   lived over 50 years and I never experienced anything.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.760]   Of course, I've never gone through the war physically.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.080]   You know, my parents' generation and that generation went through all kinds of
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.440]   wars, but I haven't experienced that.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.920]   This is probably the craziest thing, at least most people, you know, my age or
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.880]   younger would say that they've ever seen, unless you've been to some kind of war.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.520]   In this time of darkness and uncertainty, whose voice are we looking to?
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:36.080]   A lot of people are hanging on to every word of the governor, every word of the
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.880]   president or the doctors, or maybe even the lawyers, or sometimes the movie stars,
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.720]   the athletes.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.320]   What do they have to say?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.360]   What are they saying?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   When is it safe?
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.840]   When can we live?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.600]   Where's the stock market going?
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.400]   Is my job going to be okay?
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.840]   But who do we look to?
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.040]   Whose voice are we looking to?
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.800]   Do we pay attention to our shepherd's voice as much as we pay attention to the
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.720]   leaders of our country?
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:10.040]   Because all leaders ultimately are his under shepherds.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:17.000]   Third and finally, Jesus, the door, the good shepherd, leads us to green pastures
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.960]   and to abundant life.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.040]   The reason why they hear his voice and they follow him is because they know that
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.360]   the shepherd is going to lead them to green pastures.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.120]   Now, if the shepherd says something and they all run and every time they run, he
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.200]   hits them, right?
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.400]   They're going to hear his voice and they're going to run the opposite direction.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.560]   They're not going to follow him.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.640]   They're going to run from him.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.280]   But when the shepherd says something and the sheep perk up and they go, they run to
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.920]   him because they know that he's going to lead them to green pastures.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.120]   And that's why we follow.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:57.800]   Sometimes the green pastures may be a path that you have to go through the valley to
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.160]   get there.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.960]   Sometimes you have to go through wolves because the green pastures is on the other
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.400]   side.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.320]   And that's why they cling to the shepherd because they know that the shepherd knows
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:10.640]   the way.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.040]   They know that the shepherd is going to protect them.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   They know that if they stick with the shepherd, they're going to green pastures.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.840]   And that's what he says in chapter 10, verse 9 through 12.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.880]   I am the door.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.800]   If anyone enters through me, he will be saved.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.480]   You see the door that they're trying to get into the synagogue.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.160]   You're trying so hard and you're so afraid of being kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.320]   But once you get in there, it's actually more dangerous because they're thieves.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.720]   And when danger actually comes, they're going to leave.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.120]   But if you come through me, he said, you will be saved.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.040]   And we'll go in and out and find pasture.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.320]   The thief comes only to steal and kill and to destroy.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.160]   And who is he talking about?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.520]   The Pharisees.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.760]   I came that they may have life and have life and have it abundantly.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.960]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.520]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.800]   You see the distinction between the shepherds, the fake shepherds and the real shepherd.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.560]   The fake shepherd will lay your life down to protect himself.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.400]   The good shepherd lays down his life to protect us.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:28.000]   You know, one of my favorite passages and favorite parts of the gospel message is this part
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.840]   where he says that I have come to give life and to give it abundantly.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.120]   He didn't just give life.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.200]   He didn't just get people who are going to die and go to hell and be punished forever.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.680]   And then he just kind of like reluctantly saved us and said, OK, now you don't have to go.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.280]   He changed the line for us.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.720]   Now we can get to heaven.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.920]   He says, I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.640]   So sometimes we focus on the life and we miss the whole part of being abundant.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:04.760]   Because the part of life, the point of life is the abundant life, not just life.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.680]   Because sometimes we think of life as just not dying.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.600]   Sometimes we think of life as just not being punished, not going to hell.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   He said the whole point of why he came and why his sheep hears his voice and they follow him
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.920]   is so that he may lead them to green pasture so they may have life abundant.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.760]   In 2 Peter 1 11, it says, for in this way, the entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.680]   and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.760]   In other words, it's going to be crystal clear.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.800]   Everything that you need for a life of godliness has been given to you.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.440]   God did not give you bits and pieces and tease us.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.600]   He's not playing hide and seek.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.840]   That if you find me under the rock, if you find me in certain places that that I'll come out and I'll bless you.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.880]   He says, no, he said he will abundantly supply it to you.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.160]   Neon signs, straight roads.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:04.000]   And that's why if you guys ever studied the cities of refuge, that's where people ran
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.760]   when they when they by accident killed somebody.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.000]   And the avenger of blood, their nearest kin basically wants to kill you because you killed their relative.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.240]   So out of fear, they begin to run to the run to the city of refuge, six cities scattered around Israel
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.000]   in the highest plains so that anyone anywhere in Israel can see.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.720]   And there was a constant reminder that if I'm in danger, I go to the city, I go to the city of refuge.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:37.240]   All the best roads in Israel were roads that were that led them to the city of refuge because God commanded them
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.600]   to lower the the mountains or the hills and raise the valleys.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:49.560]   In other words, make the path that runs to the city of refuge the easiest path that they can take
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.280]   so that the one who is running will not have to go through the valleys.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.640]   They don't have to go climb the hills that they just run a straight path to the city of refuge.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.320]   Why did he do that? Of course, he cared.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.920]   He was trying to protect somebody who accidentally killed somebody.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.760]   But ultimately, all of that pointed to Christ.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.400]   That the roads that lead to Christ.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:18.120]   For his sheep, he prepared for us, and he says he abundantly prepared for us.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   Isaiah 55, 7, let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.000]   and let him return to the Lord and he will have compassion on him and to our God.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.480]   And he will abundantly pardon.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:39.000]   Do you sometimes feel like when you repent that God reluctantly forgave you?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.280]   Oh, my gosh, again, OK, just one more time, you do it again, I'll kill you.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.240]   How many times do we think?
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.000]   We've exhausted his patience.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.480]   And we are forgiven, but just barely, you know, just barely.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.360]   You know, there's some there's some, you know, like lovable, cute people.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:06.000]   They embrace, they sit on his lap and say, oh, you know, Heavenly Father, we love you.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   There's a lot of us who think that our pardon was reluctant.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.440]   He begrudgingly pardoned us.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.120]   That's not what he says.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:21.040]   He says not only did he make the way to salvation abundantly clear,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   he said that his pardon was abundant.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.800]   And that's why the Bible describes when a sinner repents.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.560]   What happens?
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.600]   Heavens celebrate.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.240]   That's why he gave the picture in Luke chapter 15.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.680]   He said when a sheep goes astray, he's like, oh, my gosh, he went astray again.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.120]   He says he left them behind, he went after him.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.720]   And what was his point?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:52.440]   Every sinner, everyone, every one of those sheep matters to him.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.680]   And then when he comes back, what happens?
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.840]   They celebrate, they call a huge party.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.040]   And then they have the lost coin.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.560]   He sweeps the whole house.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.640]   It's like, ah, just a little coin.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.600]   I have all this other, I'm a rich person.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.440]   He said, no, that one coin is precious.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.400]   He sweeps the whole house.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   And then when they find the coin, they have a huge celebration.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.480]   Right?
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.200]   Those of us who are anals will look at that and say, well, that kind of defeats the purpose
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.160]   of finding the coin if you spend all of that to celebrate finding the coin.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.680]   But that was not the point.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.920]   Don't get sidetracked.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.400]   The point is that it was precious.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.480]   And he was willing to sweep the house.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.800]   And he was overjoyed when he found it.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.400]   And all of that leads to the prodigal son.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:42.760]   When the son leaves and he comes back, his father is a, okay, you screwed up.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.200]   So you want to be one of my servants?
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.680]   Okay.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.360]   Even that, you're going to have to earn that.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.480]   Go live with the pigs for a while.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.840]   And if you do good for the next two years, we'll consider.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.480]   That's not what he says.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.680]   The parable that Jesus gave was the father was eagerly waiting for him to return.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:05.320]   And when he came back, even before he said, I'm sorry, he knew.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.960]   He knew the humble position that he was in.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.520]   The father runs out, puts a cloak on, puts a cipolla on him, brings him back home and says,
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.040]   we're going to have the biggest party we've ever had.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.840]   So when he says he will lead us to green pastures, that we may have life, not just life,
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.240]   not just not die, but have abundant life.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.520]   We are abundantly pardoned.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.960]   Exodus 34, 6, "Then the Lord passed by in front of him and proclaimed,
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.000]   'The Lord, the Lord God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.880]   abounding in loving kindness and truth.'"
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:51.280]   You and I, no matter where we are in our walk with God, maybe even this week, we failed.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.920]   Maybe even this week, as we are worshipping God sitting wherever we are,
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.440]   we may be thinking, I better do better this week.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.760]   And maybe we should, you know, we should try harder.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:13.120]   But in the end, in the end, the Bible says we are where we are because he is abounding in compassion.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.360]   He didn't bring us into his kingdom reluctantly.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.320]   He didn't turn the other way and say, you know what, that one, I'll let him squeeze in.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:26.000]   Every single one of us with the lost sheep, the lost coin and the prodigal son.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.600]   And God called us out by name.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.200]   And that's why you and I are here.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.680]   Psalm 36, 7-9, "How precious is your loving kindness, O God,
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.280]   and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.080]   They drink their fill of abundance of your house.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.840]   For with you, and you give them to drink the river of your delight.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.600]   For with you is the fountain of life and in your light we see light."
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.840]   You see how the description of our salvation, of our life, is not just you will not die.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.000]   It's abundance in your house, river that's filled with delight, fountain of light.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.360]   That's what he means.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   When he saved us, he saved us so that you and I can have life and have this life abundant.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.920]   That's why one of the greatest evidence of somebody who has encountered Christ is joy.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.040]   Life.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.840]   I mean, you ever see somebody who accept, genuinely accept Christ?
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.720]   Some of you may have been recent.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.880]   Maybe it's been a while.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.400]   Maybe you were on a mission field sometime.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.920]   But you ever meet somebody who met Christ, like, you know, like just immediately met Christ?
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.480]   You ever meet somebody who met Christ and they're kind of like, "Oh, I'm so depressed."
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.640]   I don't know, maybe you met somebody.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:52.640]   But I've never met anybody who just met Christ and their immediate reaction is depression.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:48:00.760]   Right? You know, part of the reason why so many are discontent is
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.280]   because they have strayed from the well of Christ.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.520]   They're not drinking from the river of life.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.680]   Maybe at one point you experienced it, but you drifted from that.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.400]   They're not eating from the bread of life.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.240]   They're not being guided by the Father of light.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.000]   They're not running toward Christ as life and resurrection.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.200]   That we want certain doors to open that may lead us to more heartache.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:38.480]   We're looking to shepherds that's going to guide us, that ultimately is going to hurt us.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.560]   Let me finish with this, this favorite psalm of so many people, Psalm 23.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:50.360]   Because this relationship basically summarizes our relationship with Christ.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.680]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.600]   Meaning, I am content with Christ.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.160]   I have enough in Christ.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.240]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.160]   There are no other doors.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.360]   There's no other water.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.400]   There's no other bread.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.320]   There's no other light.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   There's no other gate.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.520]   There's no other shepherd that I'm looking for.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.760]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.400]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:24.600]   Not the leaders, not my education, not my business, not opportunities, not my friends.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.520]   And sometimes maybe not even our church.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.920]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.800]   He leads me besides quiet waters.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.520]   Maybe some of us are in turmoil.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.280]   Now I know some people are getting furloughed.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.760]   There's some anxiety, especially the healthcare workers going into work.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.360]   There's anxiousness of possibly you're being exposed and you're going to get it
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.760]   and bring it home and there's a lot of anxiousness.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.640]   But where do you find peace?
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.200]   So he restores my soul.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.280]   He's the one where I find peace.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.520]   He's the one who leads me to green pastures.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.400]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.360]   For his namesake, even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.040]   You know what shadow of death means?
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   When you see the shadow, it means the reality is coming.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.520]   So in other words, it's close.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:27.200]   And again, I think, you know, at least in my lifetime where the whole world was locked
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.040]   down because of fear of death, I mean, a good way to put that is a shadow of death.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.480]   I think the reality of death has caused all of us to be more sober.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.960]   Whether that happens or doesn't happen during this period,
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.760]   we know for a fact that it is coming.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.320]   The shadow of death lingers over mankind.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.920]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:58.680]   That because of the sin of mankind, the bondage and the fear of death has gripped the whole world.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.080]   But he says, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.760]   You know, you notice how he said he doesn't fear death.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.960]   He doesn't feel hardship.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.920]   He doesn't fear suffering.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.720]   He says, no, I fear no evil.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:18.640]   Because even as sheep at times will go through suffering, we're going to have to go through the valleys, dryness, wolves.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.440]   And ultimately, we will all die physically.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   But here he says, I fear no evil.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.400]   You know, the sting of death is sin.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.640]   So in other words, he says, because he's taken away the sting of death, I fear no evil.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.680]   That even in death, my shepherd guides me.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.080]   For you are with me.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.040]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:46.840]   The reason why the shepherd holds the staff is to fight off the wolves who come to.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.880]   So it was a it was a source of a weapon.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:57.760]   But he said when he sees his strength, his rod, they comfort me because that rod is to protect them.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:06.240]   His judgment, his righteousness, even at time discipline in the church, he said it comforts them because it's for their own good.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.680]   You prepare a table, table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.720]   I do not need to fear those who want to hurt me because my shepherd is with me.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.120]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.920]   In other words, I have been set apart for his service.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.440]   And so my cup overflows.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.520]   I pray that as we meditate and think about Christ as our door and him as our shepherd.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.080]   And we ask ourselves, is my cup truly overflowing?
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.280]   Do I catch myself day to day overflowing gratitude for what I have?
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:48.840]   Or am I constantly thinking that only if I had this, only if I had that, only if I could get out, only if I can get a promotion.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.360]   Is my cup overflowing?
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.480]   Are we experiencing this abundant life?
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.840]   And I think, again, with all the horrible things that may be going on around the world.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:06.880]   That this time is God ordained for us to maybe take a step back to refocus our attention on our shepherd.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:12.640]   And ask ourselves, am I going to the green pastures that he is leading me to?
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.680]   Or have I been drifting somewhere else?
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:23.000]   And let me leave you with this, and I've shared this so many times, I think some of you may have memorized it.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:33.600]   When I was younger, my parents had this little clock in our living room and on it had a little proverb, not from the Bible.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.640]   I think it was given to them as a gift.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:41.280]   And on that it said, happiness is wanting what you have and not having what you want.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.480]   Let me say that again. Happiness is wanting what you have and not having what you want.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:54.440]   And I remember so many days sitting on my couch, angry about something, discontent about something.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.200]   Maybe I got in a fight with my brothers or my mom punished me for something.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:07.640]   And I'm just sitting there pouting and I'm looking at this clock and I would just, happiness is having what you want, not wanting what you have.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:16.440]   Now, it got embedded into my psyche, not because I understood it, not because I was applying it, but because it was just right there.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.920]   It was on the wall for years.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:25.720]   Looking back at it now, and I think so much about how, where my discontent comes from.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:36.360]   So much of my discontent comes from wanting to think that if I have what I want, that that's when I'm going to have abundant life.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:42.040]   But the salvation that he gave us, every sheep of his already has.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:48.160]   And when we recognize the value of what God has already given us, that's when we find life.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.840]   That's when we find life abundantly.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:59.960]   So I pray that again, there's all the distractions and everything else that again, not that you're not distracted, there's a lot of stuff to distract us even at home.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:09.720]   But in the midst of this pandemic and when our normal life is not happening right now, that it'd be an opportunity for us to focus.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.800]   What is it that I should be rejoicing in that I've kind of drifted from?
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:18.520]   And learn to restore that abundant life that God intended for us.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.380]   Let's pray.
