[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   Please turn with me to Hebrews chapter 1. I'll be reading from 4 to all the way to 14, even though
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.560]   I'm not gonna be addressing all of it today. This is gonna be part 1 of possibly 3 parts. We want
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.640]   to take our time, really comb through what the author is saying here about Jesus and in his
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.680]   relationship with the angels. And so today's gonna be the first part. We're gonna be addressing two
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.440]   of the things that he says and then possibly two or three next week. And then if we don't finish,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.560]   we'll do that the third part. Okay. Starting from verse 4, again reading out of the NASB. "Having
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.840]   become as much better than the angels as he has inherited a more excellent name than they. For to
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.920]   which of the angels did he ever say, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you.' And again, 'I will
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.840]   be a father to him and he will be a son to me.' And when he again brings the firstborn into the
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   world, he says, 'And let all the angels of God worship him.' And of the angels he says, 'Who
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.200]   makes his angels winds and his ministers a flame of fire?' But of the Son he says, 'Your throne,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.000]   O God, is forever and ever. And the righteous scepter is a scepter of his kingdom. You have
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080]   loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.320]   the oil of gladness above your companions. And you Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.760]   of the earth and the heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish but you remain. And they
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.640]   will be... and they all will become old like a garment. And like a mantle you will roll them up.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.080]   Like a garment they will also be changed. But you are the same. And your years will not come to an
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.240]   end. But to which of the angels has he ever said, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.400]   footstool for your feet.' Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.480]   of those who will inherit salvation? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that you would bless this
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.040]   time. That you would open our ears, often our hearts. Help us to be obedient to all that you
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.960]   have to teach. That we would not simply be mere hearers, but to be doers of your word. We pray
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.760]   that you would be blessed as we are blessed to be in your presence. In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.960]   Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question and I don't want anybody to answer. Just kind of think about it.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.720]   Okay, which is a more important question? Who is Jesus or who is Jesus to you? Again, don't, don't
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   answer. I just want you to think about it. Which is a more important question? Who is Jesus or who
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   is Jesus to you? The answer to that question is simple. It's yes. It's both. It's not one or the
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.560]   other. So if you're not careful, you can be a part of a camp where who Jesus is, in object of truth,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.800]   isn't, doesn't really matter because it only matters what he means to me. So whether he is the
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.000]   Son of God or whether he's the Messiah, it doesn't matter because this is what he means to me. Now
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.680]   obviously that is completely false. You can't create a God that of your desire and then say,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.600]   well you know that's what he means to me so it doesn't matter. That's good for you, it's good
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   for me. It has nothing to do with objective truth. Obviously if you're a member in this church, we
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.000]   don't emphasize that and it is absolutely essential that you know who he is objectively. What is the
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.120]   truth about who Jesus is? But for whatever the reason, if you belong to a church where the Bible
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.200]   is being taught, there has, there's a tendency for us to gravitate toward truth and begin to
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.680]   ignore the subjective truth of what does that mean to you. So we know who Jesus is. He's the
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.600]   second person of the Trinity. We know that he's the Messiah. We know he's the Savior. We know he
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.240]   is God. But what does that mean to you? The purpose of the book of Hebrews is not to simply get
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.360]   Christology correct. It's not simply so that at the end of the study of the book of Hebrews and
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   say, you know what, you know I spent so much time in understanding who Jesus is and how he fulfilled
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.640]   all the things that God was doing in the Old Testament and I can answer these questions. The
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.880]   goal of the book of Hebrews is not simply get the Christology right. He says again in chapter 2 verse
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.160]   1, as he concludes this section, he says, for this reason, because Jesus is greater than the prophets
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.040]   and greater than the angels, for this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.160]   heard so that we do not drift away from it. When he says drifting away from it, he's not simply
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.840]   talking about theology. That at one point you believe that he was God and then you kind of
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.480]   drifted and you started saying that he's not God. He's saying because you believe that he is God,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.840]   what does that mean? What does that look like in your life? The goal of our study is not simply
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.280]   Christology. It's by understanding his true identity. Again, this is, I would say, Hebrews chapter 1 and
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.960]   2 in particular, I've probably spent more time in these two texts in evangelism, talking to Jehovah
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   Witnesses and about the Trinity than any other text. Because to me, and people may disagree
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.720]   with me, and some people may have different opinion, it is the clearest text that teaches
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.560]   about the Trinity, about who Jesus is in his identity, in his relationship with the Father,
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.080]   and to the rest of creation. And so oftentimes I find myself, if I'm talking to Jehovah Witnesses,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.400]   this is the text I end up going to. And you'll see that if you, especially with the Jehovah
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.720]   Witnesses, because we have a very different view of who Jesus is, even though the language sounds
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.000]   the same, that this is the text I usually come to. And you'll find out that their translation is
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.080]   deliberately mistranslated because they can't interpret and understand what he is saying here.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.160]   And so I've had many discussions with Jehovah Witnesses in this text. And so I hope that through
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.360]   this study that you'll get a firmer grasp of who Jesus is. But again, the ultimate goal of this
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   study is not so that at the end of it say, "Oh, I can now have a discussion with the Jehovah
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.240]   Witnesses and I can refute false doctrines." Because that is not the goal of the writer.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.520]   The goal of the writer is if you know that, if you believe that, and if you can confess that,
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:32.080]   if you can argue that, then what does that mean to you? Who does Jesus mean to you? Last week we
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.320]   talked about how Jesus is greater than the prophets and all of that was a setup to pay attention. And
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.240]   so now he begins this week in this text to talk about how Jesus is greater than the angels. And
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.760]   I've already stated that the angels were believed to be the greatest or the highest created beings.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:56.080]   So it was God and then the angels. In fact, in Hebrews chapter 2, 9, talking about Jesus's
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:03.560]   incarnation, he says, "For a little while Jesus was made a little lower than the angels." So it
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.640]   clearly states that even though man was the center of creation in Genesis chapter 1, 2,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.080]   it says that in God's total plan of creation that we were actually made a little bit lower. So they
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.560]   were higher than us. When we typically think of angels, you know, we have exaggerated versions
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.120]   of good angels and bad angels, right? And a lot of it, if not most of what I hear about angels,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.680]   usually come from television or movies. And that's why, you know, again, this is my personal thing,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.400]   that horror movies are horrible because it gives you bad theology. It gives you really horrible
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   theology. Because the horror movies, usually the superpower in horror movies is usually Satan. And
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.160]   nobody can do anything. And that's why it's so scary because there's nothing that they can do.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.560]   And like it or not, even though, no matter how strong you think you are mentally, if you sit in
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.520]   front of that and you're entertained by that, it's gonna affect your theology in your head,
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   at least emotionally. Again, so that's my opinion. That's not a fact, but you know,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.480]   like I would encourage you to stay away from it if you can, okay? And I know you can. All right?
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:22.280]   So most of what we think about angels are usually exaggerated. So you typically, you know, you have
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:28.480]   angels, the good angels are the white angels with wings, right? And they can fly and they're
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.040]   benevolent. They're always caring, looking out for you. And that's the angels. And then you have
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.320]   the bad angels who are demonic and they're usually in dark colors. They have horns, right? And they're
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.920]   bad and they're ugly, right? They're either in red, some cape, and so they're ugly. According
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.840]   to scripture, in their nature, it's the same. So if you were to take a bunch of people who committed
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.560]   crime and maybe straight-A students and you put them in the same line, you're not gonna simply say,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.240]   "Criminal, not criminal. Criminal, not criminal." Because the only distinction may be their moral
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.320]   nature. And that's exactly how the Bible describes angels. They, on the surface, probably look exactly
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:15.120]   the same. And the reason why demonic angels have so much power to lure people into the world is
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.800]   because they're just as attractive. In fact, the greatest and the highest, most attractive angel
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:29.960]   is Lucifer. So he doesn't scare us into chasing after the world. He lures us, much like Babylon.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:37.280]   But what he's referring to here is not the demons. What he's referring here are the angels who are
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.320]   still in service. In fact, just to understand the context before we even get into what Paul says,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360]   we need to know what they understood, what the Jewish community understood about the angels.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:58.520]   They were considered holy, powerful, above human beings. The Bible describes the numbers of angels
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   as myriads of myriads. Now, the term "myriads of myriads" literally just means tens of thousands.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.800]   Now, tens of thousands doesn't sound like a lot, right? I remember when we were younger,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.120]   when somebody said, "Oh, he's a millionaire." And that meant a lot. It's like, "Oh, you know,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   by the time I'm 30, I'm gonna be a millionaire." Now, if somebody says, "I'm a millionaire," it's
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:26.640]   like, "What? That's your goal?" Now people say "billionaire" because the devaluing of money and
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.320]   that you have to make a lot more. So tens of thousands, the way they use it, literally means
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.840]   tens of thousands, but the way the Bible uses it as numbers that you can't count. Like today,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.880]   if you want to have a high number, you don't just say "million," you say "billions" or "gazillion"
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.720]   or "google." Or if you want to go even beyond that, you say "infinity times infinity." Basically,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.520]   what that means is you can't count. And so when the Bible says that there are myriads upon myriads
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:59.800]   of angels, they're numberless. That's how many there are. So nobody knows exactly how many angels
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   were created, but they were created in large numbers to the point where we couldn't count.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.800]   The Bible says that the angels actually have their own language. In Corinthians, it says it's
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:18.560]   speaking of tongues of men and of angels. So they're a community. They're not just random
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:27.240]   beings just roaming around. The Bible also says that they have emotion. And so scripture describes
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   that when a sinner repents, he says all the angels in heaven rejoices. They are highly organized. The
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.520]   Bible says that there's Archangel Michael, Gabriel, and Lucifer was the highest of the angels before
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.840]   he fell. So it sounds like the way that the angels are described, like a military. So you have
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.800]   commanding officers, you have the archangel, and you have various angels who are subordinate,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.760]   following, and so the community of angels is highly organized. In fact, the Jewish community
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:05.240]   had such high regard for the angels. Paul says in Colossians 2 18 to watch out for people who
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:11.920]   lead you into worship of angels. Colossians 2 18, "Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:18.960]   delighting in self-abasement and the worship of angels." To say that Jesus is superior to angels
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:27.920]   is basically saying Jesus is God, because there was nothing between the angels and God. And so again,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   some of the things that I'm gonna say this morning is gonna sound a bit technical, but this
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.960]   technicality is very important in understanding Jesus's identity. So again, I say this every
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.800]   once in a while because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose some of you. Okay, so I'm trying to gain some of
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:52.120]   you to pay a little bit more attention than normal. Okay, he begins by saying, verse 4, "Having become
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:59.160]   as much better than the angels, he has inherited a more excellent name, for to which of the sons you
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:07.480]   are my son, today I have begotten you." So when he says he became and he has begotten, the first
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.760]   thing that someone would ask was, Jesus is clearly a created being. That's what he says. He was begotten.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:25.440]   He became. The typical word for making something out of nothing is the word in Greek, "poieo." So if
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.240]   that's what the author meant, it would have been much more clear for him to use the word "poieos,"
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:37.680]   to make something out of nothing. But the word he uses here is not "poieo," but "ginomai." And the
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:44.080]   word "ginomai" basically means that to be transformed from one to another. It's not creation from nothing
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.640]   to something. The theologians call that "ex nihilo," something out of nothing, and only God has the
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.280]   ability to do that. He's not saying that Jesus was nothing and then he became something, but he was
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.920]   being transformed from one form to another. In 1st Corinthians 4 15, that same word is used this way,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.720]   "For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers. For in
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel." So here he's not saying that the Corinthians
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.400]   didn't exist and all of a sudden they came into existence because of Paul. He's saying that they
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   weren't Christians, they became Christians. Again, Philemon verse 10, "I appeal to you for my child
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:31.720]   Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment." He's not saying that he didn't exist and then he
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.400]   gave birth and all of a sudden he came to being. Obviously he's saying that he's using the word
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.880]   "begotten" in the same way, that he transformed from one to another. Now I think the best illustration
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.480]   of that is found in Philippians chapter 2 6 through 11, where Jesus humbles himself and then he is
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.960]   exalted and then he he receives a name that is greater than any other. So Philippians 2 6 through 11,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.880]   "Who although he existed in form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   but he emptied himself." So let me stop right there. So God, Jesus didn't all of a sudden appear out of
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.920]   nowhere in his humanity. He said he was God and he was pre-existent. But what he emptied himself was
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.400]   the glory. He said he emptied himself of his glory, he took on a form of a servant, being made in
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.200]   likeness of men, being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself becoming obedient to the
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.760]   point of death and even death on a cross. And for this reason, because he emptied himself, became
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   nothing, for this reason God highly exalted him, bestowed on him the name which is above every name,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.280]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:52.240]   So we clearly see here that Christ wasn't created. He was God. He veiled his glory in
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:16:02.840]   humanity and he humbled himself. And this humility is permanent. His union, his 100% God, 100% man,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.200]   is a permanent union where he veils his glory and as a result of what he has done, he says,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:17.120]   God the Father exalts him and causes him to be exalted in his name to be honored. Now all of
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   that may or may not be going over your head, but it is a clear teaching of Jesus's deity. It's a
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.000]   clear teaching that he is equal with God and yet he is also distinct. And I'm going to continue to
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.700]   go forward. So he begins by declaring that and then he goes even further than that and he says,
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:42.720]   Jesus inherited a better name than the angels. Now I've already shared that the angels were
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.440]   considered the highest of beings and they were considered so highly that many of them were
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.480]   tempted to worship the angels. In fact, oftentimes you'll see, and I'll mention this later, where you
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.480]   have encounters with the saints of the Old Testament and New Testament and their immediate
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.200]   reaction is to bow down and worship. And then angels stop them. And I'll mention a little bit
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:12.640]   more later. That's how they regarded the angels. But here the author says he inherited a better
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.600]   name. He was made a little bit lower in his humanity, but as a result he is exalted. He was
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.000]   placed higher than the angels, better than the angels. Now again, in our culture when we say
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.040]   your name is better than his name, we just mean it sounds better, right? You meet a guy named Dorcas,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.680]   right? That's the actual name in the Bible. His name is Dorcas and then you meet another guy named
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.400]   Roman, right? I told Roman so many times, I don't know if he's in the room, like he's my, that's my
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.920]   favorite name, okay? Centurion, Roman, right? So today when we say, you know, Roman, you have a
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.440]   better name than Dorcas. We just mean that it sounds better, right? In context, in culture,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.560]   you have to understand what they mean by better name. Because we don't use names in that way.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.840]   It's kind of like if we were to use nicknames to describe that person, like, oh Michael Jordan is
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.720]   the goat, right? Or he is this type of person, that type of person. Well the name in the Bibles were
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:20.280]   directly related to their character or God's purpose in their life. We see that with Abram,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:28.360]   which means exalted father. He doesn't have a child until his his senior year and then God
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:35.600]   says, I'm gonna make you a great nation and changes his name to Abraham, which means father of many,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:43.120]   multitudes. Can you imagine Abraham saying like, you know, my name is bad as it is, the exalted
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.720]   father when he's not a father, and then now he's gonna make him go around, introduce himself to
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   his friends and his family and say, I'm father of many, right? But that was clearly linked to
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.840]   God's purpose in his life because God chose Abraham to bear many children and he prophesied
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.240]   that it was going to be numerous and through that many other nations are going to be blessed. And
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:14.280]   so his name is directly linked to God's purpose in his life. Isaac, his name literally means laughter,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.240]   and they named him laughter for two reasons. One, because God said you're gonna have a child
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:25.560]   and they said at this age? And so in unbelief they laughed. But also they named him laughter
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.400]   because from that unbelief God was gracious and they gave him Isaac and they rejoice. And so he
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.440]   was named laughter. Again, it points to just by studying their name you can see the redemptive
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:46.200]   history and what God is doing. Jacob, his name literally means grasper of heel. Can you imagine that? He
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   came out and grasper of heels is like, oh Jacob, right? And that's what he was named all his life
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:57.720]   to remind him you're the guy who usurped your older brother of his birthright. Later on as he
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.000]   matures and his faith begins to grow and God blesses his life, he wrestles with God. You know
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.160]   that scene where Jacob is wrestling and as a result of wrestling he said I'm not gonna go until you
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.280]   bless me and he changes his name from Jacob to Israel. And the name Israel literally means one
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:21.760]   who wrestles with God. David, David is a man that God hand chooses and he says he's a man who's after
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:28.440]   my own heart. His name means beloved because that's exactly who he was. God hand-picked him because
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:36.480]   God favored him. Simon, Jesus changes his name to Peter which means the rock and he confesses who
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.600]   Jesus says. He says upon this confession, upon this rock I will build my church. So Peter becomes the
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:48.000]   first leader of the New Testament Church. Apostle Paul, before he starts ministry, he had two names.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.320]   He had a Hebrew name and he had a Gentile name. He was called Saul and then when he's called
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.040]   into ministry he begins to call himself Paul and then so after Acts chapter 13 we only hear him as
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.480]   Apostle Paul because Acts chapter 13 is when he begins his missionary journeys. So he begins to
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.320]   use his Gentile name to convey that he's an apostle to the Gentiles. So in the Bible, in the
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.760]   Old Testament and the New Testament, when they talk about name, it has much more significance
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:25.880]   than what you and I typically think. It is directly linked to their character, God's calling, redemptive
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:35.400]   history, and their very nature. So when the Bible says, Philippians 2 10, so that at the name of
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.600]   Jesus every knee will bow. They're not simply talking about when they hear his name. They're
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:51.400]   talking about in his essence, in his presence. Every knee will bow. It's not should bow. When they are
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.640]   in the presence of who is essence of who Jesus is, they will bow. Of those who are in heaven and
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   on earth and under the earth. That's how high he is exalted. Ephesians 1 21, far above all rule and
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:13.440]   authority and power and dominion. Again, the emphasis here is all. Not most, not a lot, all rule and all
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.840]   authority and power and dominion. Every name that is named, not only in the age, but also in the one
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:29.440]   to come. Again, the question is not, you know, you probably knew God is exalted. Jesus Christ is God.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.560]   I mean, you believe in the Trinity. I mean, that's taught in our membership class. But to the degree
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:42.720]   that he is emphasizing and making us sure that we know the details. There's over 500 different names
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.760]   and titles that are given to Jesus in the Bible, both in the Old and the New Testament. I want to
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:53.920]   highlight a few to you. Jesus is almighty one, Alpha and Omega. He's the advocate, author and
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:23:00.160]   perfect of our faith. He is the final authority. He's the bread of life, beloved son of God, bridegroom,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:07.480]   chief cornerstone, deliverer, faithful and true, good shepherd, great high priest. He's the head of
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:15.680]   the church. He's a holy servant. He's a great I am. He's Emmanuel, judge, king of kings, lamb of God, light
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:23.400]   of the world, lion of the tribe of Judah, Lord of all, mediator, Messiah, mighty one, redeemer. He's
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:31.040]   the rock, Savior, son of man, son of the Most High, creator, resurrection and the life, the good shepherd,
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.120]   the way and the truth, the word, the true vine, wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father,
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:45.400]   Prince of Peace. We can hear all of these things as separate titles, but again, if you hear this as a
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:52.240]   Jew who understood what these title means, every single one of these things are a clear description
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:24:01.440]   of who he is, his nature and what he does. And he is saying, when he says he is above the angels, see
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:09.520]   there is nothing above the angels but God. And that's why this passage is so clear about Jesus'
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   identity. He's not creating God, the Son and the angels. You're gonna see that the Bible clearly
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   teaches that God the Father and Jesus and the Holy Spirit, and I'm not gonna get into the Holy Spirit
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.680]   today, but the Holy Spirit are the same. He's not creating a space between God and the angels. And
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   that's why the second thing that he says, once he establishes that Jesus is above all that, he's above
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:46.080]   the angels, he has a name given above all the rest of creation. Second thing he says, the angels
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:55.280]   worship Jesus and not the other way around. Verse 6, "And let all the angels of God worship him." In
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:04.560]   every instance where the angels are in service and men realize that these powerful holy creatures are
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:12.640]   in their presence, their natural inclination is to worship. Because that's who we are. Whenever we're
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.920]   in the presence of something magnificent, we tend to worship. That may be you may go to some beautiful
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   place and you're just awed. You didn't sing songs like, you know, "Grand Canyon, you're so beautiful."
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:32.480]   You may not have written poems, but in your heart there was a sense of reverence. You might have
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.440]   seen a fantastic game or somebody, you know, had the dunk contest yesterday and it's like, "Whoa!"
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.120]   Natural reaction is reverence. We're in the presence of something much more magnificent than you and I.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:52.480]   So when we see men of the Bible, men and women of the Bible, in the presence of these creatures,
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.160]   of these angels, their natural inclination was to bow down and worship because we were created
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:05.280]   to worship. Not to be worshipped, but to worship. We see in Revelation chapter 19, 10.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.040]   A great angel is guiding John through and he's showing all the different revelations and things
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:20.080]   that are happening at the end. And John couldn't help himself but to be awed. And this is what it
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.640]   says, Revelation 19, 10, "Then I fell at his feet to worship him, the angel, but he said to me, the angel,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   'Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:40.080]   and worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.'" All of a sudden he, he
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.560]   stops him and he puts a brake on it. He's like, "Stop that!" Because he would get into trouble.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.520]   If the angel just sat there and allowed him to worship him, he might have felt good.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   But he said, "Do not do that because that's a breaking of the first and most important
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.480]   commandment. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. You are to worship no other gods but me."
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.920]   So it might have felt good for the angels and that was the problem with Lucifer.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:13.600]   Lucifer fell because he wanted that glory that was going to God. And he is fighting all through
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.320]   his existence to touch some of that glory. And do you think that the angels are not aware of that?
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:25.200]   You think this angel who sees John before him, he doesn't just say, "Hey, you know, thanks for
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:32.640]   your compliment." He says, "No, stop. Do not do that. I am like you. I'm just a servant."
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:40.080]   Again in Revelation chapter 22 verse 8 through 9, "I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:53.200]   But he said to me, 'Do not do that. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren, the prophets
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:02.720]   and those who heed the words of the book. Worship God.'" It would be blasphemy for the angel to stand
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:11.040]   there and allow that worship to happen. See, but it naturally tells us that the angels were highly
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.760]   regarded, that the natural reaction of man in the presence of something so much more
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:23.200]   magnificent than him was to bow down and worship. And to the author of Hebrew to say
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:31.600]   that Jesus is greater than the angels, basically in essence he was saying that Jesus is God.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   He's not a God. He's not a form of God. He's not a presentation of God. But he is God himself.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:47.360]   Because there is nothing in between. And I want to show you a passage in John chapter 5, 22 to 23
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.600]   that makes that crystal clear. I remember, again I shared this years ago, but you know,
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.160]   years ago when I was on campus, you know, when I was a youth pastor and took a bunch of our students
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.360]   out there to share the gospel, you know, I was I think a first or second year Bible student at Biola.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:10.080]   And I was sharing the gospel and this professor at UCI saw me witnessing. And he went out of his
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.800]   way to come track me down and he said, "I can't believe you guys are still doing this." And then
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.200]   he just started going off. And so I was standing there and I had about four or five other students
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.680]   with me. And he just kind of tore into me. The Bible never says that Jesus never claimed to be
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.480]   God. You guys, you know, first century started saying this and now you're repeating this lie.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.560]   Look at the Bible. And then he started quoting scripture. He started quoting the creek.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:41.520]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm getting rocked." Right? And one of the students that was with me,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.800]   that's exactly what he said. After that professor was done, he walked away and he said, "Dude,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:51.520]   you got rocked." You know, so I said, "You know, I better find out." So I went back to my professor
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.360]   and I basically jotted down all these questions that came up and I asked him. They were very
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.560]   simple answers to all of it. He was twisting certain passages to say what he wanted to say.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.600]   Since then, obviously, you know, I've studied the scriptures and it's, you know, the passage that he
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.680]   looked at and other passages and it is crystal clear what Jesus says. And I think one of the
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.640]   clearest passages what Jesus says of himself is found in this passage, in my opinion. John chapter
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:26.400]   5, 22 to 23. Listen to what he says. This is a small portion of a larger context of Jesus declaring
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:35.280]   to be God himself. Verse 22, "For not even the Father judges anyone, but he has given all judgment
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:43.120]   to the Son." Let me stop right there. Did you just hear what he said? He didn't simply say, "Me and
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   God are equal." He didn't simply just say that. I mean, he says that in all these other places. He
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:58.560]   says, "Even the Father does not judge, but I do." Think about that. To even say that you're near God,
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:05.920]   they would have stoned you for that. To enter into the Holy of Holies and you're not a high priest,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.840]   they would have stoned you for that. How dare you show that kind of irreverence for God? Jesus said
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:20.560]   out of his own mouth, "Even the Father does not judge, but I do." I mean, you can't go beyond that.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:28.160]   Jesus did not simply say he was a God, or he's below God, he's a son of God. He says he does
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:36.400]   things that even the Father does not do. He is co-equal with God. He is the second person of the
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:46.320]   Trinity. And then he explains, "So that all will honor the Son, even as they honor the Father."
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:53.600]   The angels were trembling because John bowed down to worship. They said, "Stop that. Don't do that.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   Don't get me in trouble. I'm just like you." But Jesus says, "I do what even the Father does not do
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   in order to be what? To be honored." It's another way of saying to be worshiped like the Father.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.600]   How can anybody read that and say Jesus did not say that he's God?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:22.640]   Jesus is clearly declaring his deity. All throughout scripture, he's saying he is God,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.960]   he is God, he is God, he is God. He's not a God. He's not a form of God. He's not a presentation
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:35.040]   of God. But he is God himself. Now, let me stop right here and declare what is obvious,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:41.200]   because you all know that. Most of you already confessed that and you believe that.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.440]   But the problem with whatever theology that is so fundamental to our faith,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.080]   and we hear it often enough, it becomes mundane.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   Take a step back and think about that. The God who created your inner being walked among us.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:13.520]   He was here. He tasted our food. He struggled the same struggle that we struggle. He took on human
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:23.520]   flesh and then he was crucified. All in order to be a sympathetic high priest, to be a perfect
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   mediator between God and us. That's what we celebrate. That's what we sing about when we
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.800]   talk about the Trinity. The whole purpose of creation is that everything was made by him,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.680]   everything is held together because of him, and everything is ultimately for him.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:50.000]   Revelation chapter 5, 11 through 14, it gives us a glimpse of heaven. John sees this vision,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.640]   and this is what he sees in heaven. "Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.960]   around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders, and the numbers of them was myriads
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.320]   upon myriads, thousands upon thousands, saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.480]   slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.'"
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:16.800]   Who are the angels worshiping? Jesus. Who are the elders worshiping? Jesus.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.760]   The Lamb of God. Jesus is not standing on the side declaring glory to the Father. He is the object
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.480]   of their worship. "Thirteen, and every created thing which is in heaven and on earth and under
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:34.480]   the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, 'To him who sits on the throne and
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.440]   to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.' And the four living
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:50.720]   creatures kept saying, 'Amen,' and the elders fell down and worshipped." Jesus is not a god. He's not
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:58.240]   simply a presentation of God. He is God himself. And the Bible repeatedly over and over says again,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:11.280]   "This God loved us. This God walked among us. This God counts the hairs on our head and he cares."
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:21.520]   Believing this is what changes us. When we are in the presence of this glory that we could not get
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.400]   to, we could not simply make up our mind, "You know what? I'm going to go to go Holy of Holies. I'm
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.680]   going to have a conversation with this God because I need his help." We couldn't do that.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:37.040]   And because we couldn't go to him, Scripture says, "He veiled his glory and came to us."
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   That's what the Trinity is. He didn't simply send his messenger.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.960]   He didn't send a servant. He didn't send his angels. He came off of his throne and came to us.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.640]   The angels, the elders, the four living creatures, everything in heaven and on earth,
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.720]   forever and ever and ever, said, "We'll be worshipping Jesus, the Lamb of God."
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:14.320]   The Bible has many different words, especially in the New Testament, to describe the word "worship."
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:20.720]   The three of them are the most prominent. The first one is the word "serv" — "le truo."
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.680]   So oftentimes, you'll see in some of your translations that the priest went in and they
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.400]   worshiped God, and a lot of times that word in the Greek is "le truo." So the word "le truo,"
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:37.440]   it means to physically serve. So we use that word in our churches to say, "Throwing out trash can
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.840]   could be an act of worship to God." Babysitting, teaching, giving, all of that we do for the
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.920]   purpose of building up his kingdom is an act of worship. It's not investing. It's worship.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.320]   So that's the word "le truo." The second word is "sabomai." It means to have reverence.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.520]   So you know that you can sit here with no reverence. You can regurgitate words and go
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   through the action, but there's no sense of reverence toward God. But the second word for
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:12.240]   worship is internal, something going on internally, reverence. But the most prominent word,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.920]   majority of the words in the New Testament that is translated for worship is "proskuneo."
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:26.160]   And the word "proskuneo" literally means to fall down and worship. Literally, it means to go
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.840]   toward to kiss somebody's feet. The word "feet" is not there, but that's just assumed.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:39.040]   It's to bow down, go toward to kiss. In other words, you are so enamored, you are so awed
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:48.080]   that it causes you to be prostrated. And so in our generation, when we think of worship,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.960]   we think of Sunday morning, we think of service, maybe even a reverence in our heart and spirit
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:38:00.720]   and in truth. But the idea of being prostrated before the Almighty God has been lost,
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:09.600]   or we're beginning to lose it. Everything has become casual. We've become so concerned
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.480]   about getting more people into the church that we've made God into a lesser God.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.200]   The scripture describes Him when they're in the presence of His glory every single time,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.320]   not because they were discipled, not because they were taught, not because of years of training,
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:33.920]   but simply in the presence of this God, they prostrate themselves in surrender. That's why
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.880]   in our culture, when people like, let's say, again, at dunk contest, somebody does a great job
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.960]   and we act out, it's like, "Oh, we're not worthy, we're not worthy." Even the secular world understands
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.640]   when they're in the presence of something spectacular that they surrender, and that is
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:58.000]   the act of worship, is to surrender. So a man who has not surrendered, no matter how reverent you
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:06.800]   feel in your heart, no matter how much activity that you are engaged in, until you see and you're
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:17.200]   in the presence of the glory of who He is, and it causes us to be prostrated and go toward Him
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:26.080]   to kiss His feet in adoration, because that's how the Bible has described worship. You know
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.680]   you can come to church every single Sunday and learn all the right things and say the right things,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.840]   and you know when your heart is far from God, because proskuneo causes us to surrender.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:48.640]   The goal of the study of the book of Hebrews is not simply Christology. It's to get us to
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.120]   proskuneo. It's to get us to see the glory of who He is, that everything else in this world becomes
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:03.840]   rubbish. Those of you who've tasted the goodness of God, those of you who've seen even a glimpse
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:13.120]   of His glory, this world is ruined for you. It's ruined for you. And that's why there's so much
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:20.640]   turmoil in your heart, because nothing that you are tapping into from this world ever comes any
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:27.680]   close to what you have already experienced in Christ. And so even through trials and tribulation,
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:38.480]   why you keep coming. All my life I've only tasted sizzler's steak. I had Ruth Chris one day.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.840]   I never ordered sizzler's steak again, because it just wouldn't do it.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.280]   If you've ever tasted the goodness of God, the world is ruined for you.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:58.240]   You can make the money, you can gain the fame, you can gain the adoration, you can gain the
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.760]   friendship, but it will never come close to the glory of Christ. So the goal of the author of
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.360]   Hebrews is not simply to get them to get the right theology. It's so that in revealing
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:20.880]   the majesty of Christ, that they would join the angels in worshiping the Son. And that's my prayer.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.760]   That's my prayer as we start the book of Hebrews, that each one of these things that we see about
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.920]   Christ will cause you to see a greater and greater glimpse of who He is, which will lead us to
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.440]   surrender our lives. Let's take our time to pray as we again invite our worship team to come up.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:45.280]   So I ask you again, take some time to pray for Elder Philip as he will be having surgery,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:52.080]   but at the same time, not just for today, ask the Lord to soften your heart and let the Word of God
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.320]   truly bear fruit in your heart, and that we may see a greater, greater glimpse of Christ
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.360]   through all of it. Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
