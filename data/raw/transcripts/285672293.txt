[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   What happens in Leviticus chapter 10?
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   What happens?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.280]   First sacrifice, right?
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.040]   After all the commandments are given about the sacrifice and being clean and what to
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   do, what not to do, the first sacrifice is made in Leviticus chapter 10 and what happens?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   When they've made up a Nebihu, Aaron's two sons give the first sacrifice, what happens?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.600]   They gave, right, unauthorized fire and then as a result of that, God says, God punishes
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   them.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.840]   Fire comes down from heaven and consumes both of them.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.040]   And then it's in that context, God says, Moses said to Aaron, it is what the Lord spoke,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.120]   saying, by those who come near me, I will be treated as holy and before all people,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.840]   I will be honored.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.120]   So basically God says to the nation of Israel, you can't just approach me any way you desire,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   right?
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960]   So they approached God in a manner that God didn't tell them.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600]   So it doesn't spell out what it is.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   It was just something that God did not authorize.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.700]   They put it up on the altar and as a result of that, they die.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.960]   And so that verse is kind of like the theme verse of the book of Leviticus because the
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.000]   whole point of book of Leviticus is teaching a sinful people how to have a relationship
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.560]   with the holy God.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.720]   And so they needed to recognize what holiness is and holiness because of God's holiness,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.120]   you can't just enter into God.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.960]   So book of Leviticus is kind of a microcosm of the whole totality of redemptive history.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.400]   God is trying to teach the nation of Israel, God's trying to teach all of mankind that
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.000]   there needs to be a blood atonement that covers over the sins of mankind in order for that
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880]   relationship to be restored.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.360]   And basically Leviticus is kind of like a play playing out in human history, showing
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.680]   them that this must happen.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.800]   Ultimately, obviously this is preparing for the coming of Christ.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.880]   I didn't have notes for you because again, if you've been here for the study of all of
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.560]   book of Leviticus, you've gotten this review twice, so I don't have it for you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.400]   But those of you who want to have these slides, just email me and I'll forward it to you.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:31.480]   Actually, we're probably going to put it up on the Facebook page.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.840]   Okay.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Can you take the dongle out and put it back in?
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   Take it out and put it back in.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   Oh, there we go.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.880]   All right.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   So the title of the book Leviticus, it's appropriate considering that whole book of Leviticus is
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.240]   basically a record of God's laws, right?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   About how to approach him, what kind of sacrifices, what are acceptable, what are not acceptable,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   who can handle the sacrifices, where do they need to sacrifice, what do you do with the
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.040]   blood, what kind of clothes do you need to wear, what makes you clean, what makes you
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   unclean.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   So the whole book of Leviticus is basically a book of regulations and how to worship God.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.940]   That's what that is, right?
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.160]   How many of you have ever studied the book of Leviticus before, other than those who've
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.720]   been sitting here?
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.840]   Okay.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.560]   So a few of you, a handful of you, okay.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.440]   Book of Leviticus is probably one of those books that you probably read a couple pages
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.800]   and then if you don't get it, you're going to flip through and then you just kind of
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   quickly flip.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.520]   If you've been, if you're faithful in your Bible reading, you might've read it before,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.760]   but may have just caught bits and pieces.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.800]   I can't emphasize enough how important this book is.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.680]   Everything that we've been studying in the book of Romans is founded upon the principles
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.520]   that are taught in the book of Leviticus.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.960]   So can you understand the gospel without Leviticus?
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.320]   Of course.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:16.200]   But Leviticus is the precursor that prepared the nation of Israel to understand why the
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.860]   gospel was necessary, right?
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.320]   So if you've never studied it or you didn't understand it before, Leviticus is really
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.060]   going to open up the New Testament to you.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.200]   There's a lot of phrases and words and concepts that you probably already know, but may have
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.680]   attached your own understanding to it without realizing that it's not what the Bible says,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   right?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.120]   The idea of inheritance, the idea of punishment, the idea of atonement, holiness, all of these
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.560]   things are things that a lot of times you receive from sermons or maybe movies that
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.800]   you've watched or maybe bits and pieces of Bible studies that you've heard.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.000]   Leviticus is what sets the foundation, the behind the scenes stories that set up for
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.040]   the gospel.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.180]   So again, I can't emphasize just how important this is in understanding our faith.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.400]   The key to understanding the book of Leviticus is to do our best to decipher what it is a
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.640]   shadow of in the new covenant.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.660]   So in Colossians 2, 16-17 it says, "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge in regard to
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.920]   food or drink or in respect to festivals or new moon or the Sabbath day, things which
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.200]   are mere shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ."
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.480]   So everything that's mentioned in the book of Leviticus is a shadow, meaning the more
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.160]   you study the shadow, it builds anticipation for the reality, right?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.660]   There used to be a game show a long time ago where somebody would stand behind and then
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.160]   you would see their shadow and the whole game show was trying to match the shadow with the
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   celebrity, right?
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.120]   And so basically that's what book of Leviticus is.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.960]   It's giving the outline of the necessity of Christ so that when Christ came, you can match
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   what you're seeing in Leviticus with what Christ did and who he is.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.800]   Does that make any sense?
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:17.080]   So the benefit of the study of the book of Leviticus, it points us to a deeper understanding
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.920]   of Christ and what he has done, right?
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.880]   Leviticus is not going to make any sense.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.040]   If you don't learn how to connect that to the reality found in Christ, because it was
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.920]   meant to be a shadow, not the reality.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.960]   So if you study that this animal is clean, this animal is unclean, the end result is
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.280]   going to be, "Okay, so what?"
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.640]   We talked about menstrual cycle of women, right?
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   Like they have to be isolated for seven days.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.960]   If it happens to be a female child that is born, they have to be isolated for 14 days.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.200]   And you have all these strange laws that make absolutely no sense until you begin to realize
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.040]   what that points to ultimately.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.000]   What does it teach about the gospel, about redemptive history, about sin, about God,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.220]   about sacrifice, right?
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.000]   And so as we're studying through the book of Leviticus, our job is going to try to find
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   what do these strange laws to us in and of itself, what does it point to in Christ?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.840]   So whenever you're reading through the book of Leviticus, you have to ask yourself, "How
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.840]   is this fulfilled in Christ?"
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.540]   To give you a broad outline, the book of Exodus is the beginning of the relationship with
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.560]   Israel and God as a nation, right?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   So Exodus concluded with the tabernacle constructed and glory of the Lord filling it.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.080]   So if you remember in Exodus 40, 34 to 38, I'm not going to read all of it, but it says,
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.040]   "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.480]   Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it and the glory
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.160]   of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.600]   Now the picture I have for you there is not the tabernacle, obviously.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.500]   It's a mountain, right?
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.000]   But the whole point of the book of Leviticus is God is trying to come near Israel, but
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.240]   the whole story in the book of Exodus is telling people what?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   Does God tell them to come?
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   No.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.600]   He says, "No, do not come.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.080]   If they come, they're going to be destroyed."
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.360]   So the whole book of Exodus, God gives the law up in the mountain and they're not even
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   allowed to come and touch the mountain until he communicates with Moses.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.480]   And then at the end, all throughout the book of Exodus, if you remember the content, God
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.200]   is giving instructions to set up the tabernacle.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   So he appoints the people.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.160]   He appoints the people who are able to make it.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   How long, how big, where, what, what kind of poles to use, what kind of materials to
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.440]   use, even the garment of the priest.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.880]   So all these details of how to establish a tabernacle happens in the book of Exodus.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.520]   So at the end of Exodus, the tabernacle is established, right?
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.960]   And then the glory of the Lord begins to come off the mountain to the tabernacle, and that's
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.120]   how the book of Exodus ends, right?
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.740]   The glory of God moves from the mountain onto the tabernacle.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.400]   And then in Leviticus chapter, in the beginning of Leviticus, it begins with the Lord speaking
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.160]   to Moses from the 10th of meeting.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.960]   So Leviticus 1.1, it says, "Then the Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.660]   10th of meeting saying," right?
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.520]   And that's how the book of Leviticus begins.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:42.280]   The very word of the book in Leviticus, "waikra," which means, "and he called," and that's the
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.880]   very first word that is used in the Hebrew Bible, right?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.080]   He called, then he called.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   So Exodus ends with God coming.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   Leviticus begins by saying, "And he called," right?
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.760]   And he's beginning to talk to them from the 10th, but they're not allowed to enter the
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.500]   10th yet because the sacrifices haven't started, okay?
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.320]   So that's the picture of the tabernacle with the glory of God through the cloud hovering
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.100]   over it, and God is beginning to come drawn near, right?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:24.120]   Book of Numbers, 1.1, it says, "Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.640]   in the 10th of meeting," okay?
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.720]   You notice that?
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:44.240]   So if you go back, it says, "They were not able to enter," oops, and then Leviticus 1.1,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.440]   God speaks from the 10th, and then in Numbers 1.1, he speaks from in the 10th, okay?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.960]   So that's the progression, those three books, right?
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.080]   So you see the redemptive history of God.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.760]   You know, Genesis begins with the fall, and then mankind rebelling against God, and as
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.400]   a result in Chapter 12, God makes a promise to Abraham and then his descendants, and his
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.560]   descendants begin to grow in number, and then we go to Exodus, and they begin, and they
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.160]   grow in mass number.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   God delivers them.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.600]   As soon as he delivers them, right, he says, "Let my people go that they may," do what?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.880]   "That they may worship me," right?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.440]   That's what God says to tell Pharaoh to deliver them for the purpose of worship.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.600]   So as soon as they come out, God gives them these patterns of what to do in worship.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.040]   So the whole book of Leviticus is to establish how sinful people are going to worship God
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.320]   through the tabernacle, and then God draws near.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.040]   Leviticus teaches them what specifically to do, and then so Leviticus is the beginning
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   of that relationship.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.940]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:56.640]   And then numbers is when, is the actual practice of that.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.300]   The tabernacle in the camp of Israel is established right in the middle, okay?
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:09.820]   The four blocks that you see are the four different Levitical tribes, and then the 12
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:16.020]   tribes, 3, 3, 3, 3, are the 12 tribes of Israel, and if you look at the way God tells them
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:23.180]   to be established, every single one of them are equal distance to the tabernacle, okay?
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.100]   What do you think the point of this is?
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.220]   God's presence is at the center.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.060]   So the tabernacle wasn't some far distant thing where they established up in the mountain
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.060]   and then the nation of Israel lived far off, right?
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.260]   God's presence was at the center, the tabernacle worship, just like any group of people, even
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.260]   today, right?
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.980]   We talked about that many times.
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:52.060]   The central part of any saved Christian is the worship of God.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.620]   And so that's what God was establishing in the nation of Israel, through this tabernacle
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.540]   to teach the nation of Israel that God is at their center, right?
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.660]   And the only way that God can be in their presence is through blood sacrifice, okay?
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.500]   And all of this is a shadow that was going to ultimately point to Christ.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   So when we were going through the different offerings, we talked about how bloody the
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.220]   scene was, right?
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.780]   There was an animal being sacrificed morning and night, and they were being burned.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.840]   So there's two things that they probably saw, right?
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.500]   One is the smoke coming from the tent.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.900]   It was probably constant.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.260]   So if you were an Israelite, the smell of burnt animals was probably constant.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.780]   It was like being at a barbecue, right?
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.780]   Nonstop.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.780]   Even just on July 4th.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.740]   It was like every day, morning and night, you smelled the animals being burned.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.260]   And then if you were near the tent, you probably saw blood just constantly.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.400]   No matter how much you cleaned it, it was given morning and night, all the time.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.840]   So it was a very bloody scene, right?
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   And so you smelled it, you saw it, you probably heard the animals being slaughtered.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   And so this is right at the middle of the camp, constantly reminding them that a holy
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   God is in their presence, and sacrifice needs to be made.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:18.800]   That's embedded in them.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.580]   The ultimate goal of Leviticus is to reveal the extent of God's holiness and the need
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:28.080]   for a perfect sacrifice to atone for our sins.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.840]   Leviticus is the foundation upon which all the explanation of the gospel and the new
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.400]   covenant is built on.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.440]   So some of you guys who were with us through the 17 chapters of Leviticus, what are some
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.600]   terms that are related to the gospel that are found in Leviticus that you remember?
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.360]   I know it's been seven weeks, but...
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   What do you remember?
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.400]   There's some obvious terms.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   Atonement.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   Huh?
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.040]   Clean and unclean, right?
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   Pure and impure.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.480]   Is that it?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.160]   Blood sacrifice.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:36.400]   Inside the camp, outside the camp.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:45.580]   Holy and unholy.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.720]   Peace with God, peace with man.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.800]   It's been seven weeks, I understand.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.960]   What else?
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:05.440]   We just scratched the surface.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.160]   The depth of sin, the devastation of sin, remember?
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   Where did that come from?
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.440]   I see your brains hurting.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.360]   Where did that come from?
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.120]   Remember we talked about the degree of sin, the devastation of sin?
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.880]   What was that related to?
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.520]   The skin disease, leprosy, right?
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.080]   You don't remember?
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.920]   Okay, you remember.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.040]   You just don't want to say it.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.360]   So we just scratched the surface.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.000]   Everything about the gospel message is embedded into the book of Leviticus, and it is that
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   crucial.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.840]   It's like if you understand the gospel only from the New Testament, it's kind of like
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.600]   you jumped into the middle of the story.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.040]   It's like 30 chapters and you started in chapter maybe 20.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   And so you got the gist of it, because you got the tail end of it, and you know how it
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.280]   ended, and you know the main characters, and you know all of that, but you missed 20 chapters,
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   right?
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.800]   Two-thirds of the Bible is the Old Testament.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.480]   So if you have a very loose understanding of what God did to prepare the nation of Israel,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.000]   in particular the book of Leviticus, you can still understand the gospel, but it's going
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.400]   to be very superficial.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.960]   The word "holy" is mentioned over 93 times in the book of Leviticus.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.360]   When something is repeated that many times, you have to pay attention, right?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   God is holy.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.300]   And not only is God holy, everything related to God is holy.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.200]   And then He's trying to make His people holy, and everything that relates to God's holy
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.180]   people holy, right?
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.640]   So the whole point of this is holy people became unholy because of their sins, and by
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.160]   this blood sacrifice, He's trying to make them holy again.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:06.120]   And here's a word that reveals the meaning of holiness, the restoration of holiness that
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.360]   oftentimes we don't talk about, because typically when we think of holiness, we think of something
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.320]   pure or moral or something that's set apart, right?
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.600]   And that's the typical understanding of holy.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.980]   The English word for holy, it comes from an old English word, "halig," which means "whole"
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.980]   or "to be healthy."
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.880]   Oftentimes, you'll see in the New Testament, when it talks about sound doctrine, it means
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.520]   healthy doctrine, right?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.820]   Right doctrine.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:40.300]   So the word for right or healthy or whole is related to the word "holy" that we understand.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:48.500]   And so as a theme, to be made holy means to be made whole, something that went wrong,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.460]   to restore it back to what it was meant to be.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.900]   Okay, do you understand?
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.420]   So the whole point of holiness is not to simply separate from sin.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.540]   That is true.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.380]   But the whole point of holiness is to be set apart from what went wrong so that God can
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.820]   restore what He originally intended.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.420]   So for human beings to become holy is to go back to the state that God desired when He
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.720]   first created us, right?
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.200]   So everything that God is doing in redemptive history is to bring us back to what He originally
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.180]   intended, what He intended in marriage, what He intended in human relationship, what He
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:31.100]   intended for work, what He intended for women, what He intended for man.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.900]   All of that is to be restored back, right?
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:41.580]   And so that's why He's making us holy, not simply to keep us away from sin, but by doing
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.940]   so bring us back to what He intended, to be made whole.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.820]   And so that's what it means, these five basic themes that are related in the book of Leviticus,
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.060]   that God is holy.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.860]   Now, He's never been unholy, right?
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.220]   He's always been the standard of what is right, right?
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.800]   So our idea of understanding of love, right?
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.100]   When people have a preconceived idea of what love is and then they go to God and God doesn't
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.780]   fit the idea of love in this world, what do they do?
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.940]   God is unfair or He's unloving because He did this, this, and this.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.860]   Well, the scripture says God's love is holy, right?
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.840]   God's love is the standard.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.620]   God's love is what love was meant to be.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.860]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.420]   So right and wrong starts from God.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.940]   We don't have a sense of right and wrong and then we come to God and measure Him to see
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.620]   if He lives up to it.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.020]   God is King and He is holy.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.700]   He is whole.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:48.180]   So whatever doesn't fit His idea of right, whatever doesn't fit His idea of righteousness
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.180]   and love, something, we're the one who strayed, not Him.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.220]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.620]   So if you approach the Bible and you begin to study God and say, "Well, you know, this
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.260]   is what I understand, fairness," and then you go back to God and then begin to measure
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.980]   Him by our standard, we get into all kinds of problems, right?
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.980]   Why did God do this?
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.980]   Why did God do that?
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.500]   I said, "Well, He's the standard, right?
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.300]   He's holy and so when we approach scripture, we're learning, right?
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.780]   That's what it means not to be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:29.220]   of our mind because God is the standard of everything."
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.540]   And as a result of that, He makes His priesthood holy.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.460]   The people who are going to be the first of the ones who are going to represent Him to
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.900]   the world and world to God also need to be whole, right?
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.780]   So you can't have an ambassador for a holy God and Him give a different message, right?
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.540]   He needs to represent God properly so that's why after He gives sacrifices, the first thing
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.740]   that He teaches is the priesthood needs to properly represent God so they needed to be
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:07.720]   holy and all for the purpose of making the people holy, right?
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.660]   Making them whole, making them what God intended to begin with.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.740]   And fourthly, He makes the land holy.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.500]   I'm not going to get into this theology much.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.980]   We're going to get into this later on as we started Leviticus but the scripture does
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.860]   not just talk about God being holy, priest, man, but even the land being holy and there's
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.460]   a reason for that, okay?
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.820]   I'm going to get to that not too much in Leviticus but at some point it's going to come up, right?
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.580]   Because the Bible talks about land being holy all the time.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:44.460]   I might get into it a little bit next week, okay?
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:50.100]   And ultimately that leads to a holy Savior, right?
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:55.380]   And so this is the theme all throughout the book of Leviticus.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:02.280]   Leviticus is divided into, this is the general outline to your left, okay?
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.940]   Into two major parts.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.180]   Chapter 1 through 15 is about the priestly holiness which gives instructions about sacrifices,
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.300]   rituals, which ceremony relate to holiness.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:17.060]   And then chapter 17 to 27, the bottom part, deal with more of a practical holiness which
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.180]   worked out in the daily lives of the people, okay?
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:26.460]   So holiness of the priest in the tabernacle and worship and then 17 to 27, holiness in
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.220]   the people of God, okay?
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.200]   So it's divided into two major parts.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.980]   So this, if you look at this outline, it has an introduction and then starting from the
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.860]   priesthood, chapter 8 through chapter 10, priesthood and then 11 through 15, laws of
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.460]   clean and unclean things and then at the center is the day of atonement, chapter 16.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.660]   So if you remember the video, like, do you remember how they divided it?
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.780]   It's a little bit different than this.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.940]   How do they divide it?
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.580]   There's only one thing that's different.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.420]   16, 17 was together.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.820]   And the reason why they put it together was because chapter 17 describes what?
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.260]   Preciously of blood.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:12.100]   And so they connect that to that day of atonement that God allowed cleansing to happen because
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.560]   of shedding of blood.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.580]   So they connected it together.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.340]   In this outline, we separated it.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:23.700]   We're 17, the clean and unclean and how to handle the blood and the purpose of it.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.860]   But 17 to 20, again, it mirrors the other side where law of clean and unclean things,
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.700]   law of clean and unclean things as it pertains to God's people in their daily life and then
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   the priesthood again.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.380]   What do you call this?
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.300]   Okay, the kiastic, right?
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:45.220]   It's a kiastic outline where the outline from the first part, right, goes and then the main
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.740]   point is at the center and then it mirrors it backwards.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.460]   So when you see a kiastic outline, you're supposed to read the main point where?
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.460]   Right in the center.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.420]   Not in the beginning, not at the end, at the center.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:04.140]   So the center of the book of Leviticus is chapter 16 and 17, which is the day of atonement.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.460]   Okay?
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.940]   Okay, let me wrap up with the five major sacrifices.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.660]   And I'm just going to put it up there for sake of time.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.660]   Okay?
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:24.060]   These five offerings gives a presentation or teaching of how God views sin and how to
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.140]   restore, be restored.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.500]   And so much of this is reflected upon our Christian lives.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.200]   Burnt offering was the most important and the most frequent.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.160]   This was basically, remember we talked about that?
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.940]   What does it represent in the new covenant?
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.100]   Justification, right?
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.700]   That's a sacrifice that needed to be given.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.720]   It needs to be given repeatedly for general atonement for every sin.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.700]   And so they had to give that morning and night.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.820]   So in order to give the other sacrifices, their general sins needed to be atoned for.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.280]   So oftentimes before they gave grain offering, they would give the burnt offering first.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.440]   Before they gave thank offering, they would give the burnt offering first.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.060]   Because without the burnt offering, your sins aren't atoned for.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.700]   So you have to have your sins atoned for before you can approach God and give the other offerings.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.620]   So burnt offering was the most important offering, which represented justification, right, in
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.140]   the new covenant.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.140]   And then the grain offering was given for dedication and thank offering.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.260]   And that's where the tithe offering was given, a tenth, right?
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.580]   It was to acknowledge the lordship of God.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.740]   In the New Testament, again, the offering is a freewill offering that we give to God
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.980]   in dedication, right, confessing His Lord and Savior.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.460]   Third offering, the peace offering, it was for reconciliation and celebration.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.380]   Remember what was unique about that offering?
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.780]   That was the only offering where the offerer actually ate.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.940]   They had a picnic.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:58.500]   So for our references, it's basically a picnic offering, right?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.180]   They would give the offering, and then whoever came with them would sit on the side and eat
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.180]   meat.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.660]   So how special was that?
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.140]   Did that happen a lot?
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.780]   No.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.820]   They didn't eat meat like we eat meat, right?
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.780]   They say, "Oh, I haven't had meat in a while.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.780]   Let's just go tomorrow."
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.860]   Okay, done, right?
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:24.820]   So none of us are in a situation where you're starving for meat and you've never had meat.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.500]   It's been a year or two.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:32.100]   In Israelites, it was a very, very, very rare occasion that they were able to eat meat.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:38.180]   So that offering basically meant that because of peace with God, they were able to have
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.060]   peace with one another, right?
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.780]   And it pointed to the Old Testament in the book of Genesis when they sinned against God,
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.540]   right?
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.060]   Fellowship between husband and wife was broken.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.320]   And as a result of that, all human beings were tainted because of sin.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:02.820]   So our relationship, human relationship, is directly connected to reconciling with God,
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.580]   right?
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.860]   That's what that offering taught.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.460]   Sin offering was for cleansing of what we considered unclean.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.340]   So if you touch something that you shouldn't have touched.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:19.100]   So if you remember, if we were going through the purification laws, all of it pointed to
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.500]   you have to give a burnt offering and then you have to give a sin offering, right, to
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.260]   be cleaned.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.400]   Guilt offering for restoration and restitution.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.580]   So if you took something that didn't belong to you, right, by accident, or somebody was
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.380]   offering something, you touched it and defiled it, you would have to give that offering.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.380]   And then you have to give how much more?
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.360]   Yeah, a fifth as restitution.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.940]   So the guilt offering was for the purpose of restoration and restitution.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.820]   So all of these offerings, the five major offerings, these are not all of the offering.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.220]   This is not the total of all the offerings.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:29:00.620]   But the five major offerings give us an outline of our relationship with God, what God desires,
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.380]   not only in justification, but also in sanctification, right?
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.540]   Those of you who are married and who've gone through marriage counseling, you know, one
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.940]   of the things that I mention all the time is, you know, your priority first and foremost
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.140]   is your walk with God.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.220]   If as a Christian, if your walk with God is not right, and then you're trying to like,
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.540]   well, how do we communicate better?
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.540]   How do we love each other?
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.940]   You know, he's so insensitive.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.960]   All these things are necessary and important.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.620]   But the scripture clearly tells us that our peace with one another is directly linked
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.380]   to a peace with God, right?
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.340]   So our priority is first and foremost, make peace with God, because until you make peace
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.340]   with God, you can have all the tools to do the right things and then not do it.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.020]   You say, you know, if I say this, my wife is going to be pleased, but then she didn't
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.580]   please me, so why should I please her?
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.180]   So you know what to do, but you don't want to do it, right?
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.180]   That's mankind.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:01.100]   It's like, you know, proper communication is not rocket science necessarily, but the
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.220]   problem is our heart.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.220]   We're hurt.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.460]   We think it's unfair.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.820]   Why is she or he doing this?
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.620]   And so the scripture tells us it's reconciling with God.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.260]   When we are compelled by the love of Christ, God gives us the fuel to be able to love sinners,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.360]   right?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:25.220]   So all of this have direct application to our Christian life, justification and sanctification,
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.220]   okay?
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.540]   I think that's it for the overview.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.940]   All right.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.640]   I don't have a handout for you, so if you can take a picture of it, this is for study
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.080]   for next week.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.620]   Next week's study is on sexual immorality, okay?
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:46.060]   So those of you who are jumping in, you jumped in at the right time.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.020]   We're going to be talking about bestiality.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.820]   We're going to be talking about homosexuality.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.860]   We're going to be talking about incest, all kinds of stuff, okay?
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.580]   That's mentioned in chapter 18.
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.380]   So these are all questions that are related to that.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:08.960]   And I think this is, again, sexual immorality is probably one of the biggest issues that
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.320]   are eroding the fellowship of the church today.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.980]   And so this goes into, again, how God feels about it.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.140]   And clearly it was not just an issue of today, right?
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.140]   It wasn't just the internet.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.780]   They didn't have internet back then.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.660]   And yet they had all kinds of, so they say, "What?
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.660]   They had incest?
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.660]   They had bestiality?
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.660]   They had homosexuality?"
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.860]   Yes.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.180]   This is not a modern day problem.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:42.300]   Every sexual deviance that came, we think, because of internet was never because of internet.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.520]   Internet was just gave a, made the access easier.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.260]   This was always a sin issue of the heart, okay?
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.380]   So that's what we're going to be looking at next week.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.340]   And if you can come, just at least do your best to answer these questions.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.200]   For the rest of the time, I'm going to ask you guys to get into your small group.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.920]   So Pastor Mark is going to come and he's going to help us break up into small group.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.740]   But the questions that I've asked, a couple of them are related to the retreat.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.140]   And I know not all of you went to the retreat.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.180]   And even if you didn't go to the retreat, you can still participate because the questions
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:21.140]   are broad enough that you're going to be able to participate.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.300]   It's pretty self-explanatory.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   I'll just give it to you.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.100]   So today, since it's the first session, we're going to ask you guys to take some time to
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.660]   get to know one another and then try to go through these questions together.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.180]   So Pastor Mark is going to divide us up, okay?
