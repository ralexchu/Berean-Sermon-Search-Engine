[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   If you could turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 2 verses 5 through 8.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.400]   Hebrews chapter 2 verses 5 through 8.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.920]   I'm going to read that text again.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.520]   For he did not subject to angels the world to come concerning which we are speaking.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.720]   But one has testified somewhere saying, "What is man that you remember him, or the son of
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.760]   man that you are concerned about him?
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.860]   You have made him for a little while lower than the angels.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.080]   You have crowned him with glory and honor and have appointed him over the works of your
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.080]   hands.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.920]   You have put all things in subjection under his feet, for in subjecting all things to
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.860]   him he left nothing that is not subject to him.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.720]   But now we do not see all things subjected to him."
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:55.560]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for your consistent love and grace that
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.040]   attracts us, where we desire to honor you, to know you, to love you.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.280]   We pray that this morning that you would remind us and refresh us again with your word.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.560]   And I pray that the glory of Christ, Lord God, may be evident in all that we say and
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560]   do.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.000]   We pray that from now until the end that it is you that speaks through the Holy Spirit
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.560]   and that it would not return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.080]   And so we pray for your blessing this time, in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   Amen.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.760]   All right, as you guys know, we are continuing our series in the book of Hebrews, and the
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.840]   primary subject in the book of Hebrews is obviously Christ.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.420]   And the warning that he was giving to them is not to drift.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.320]   And our temptation in where we are is constantly drifting.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.200]   There's a reason why Jesus said it is harder for a rich man to enter through into the kingdom
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.120]   than for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.760]   And the reason why is not because innately the rich are more immoral or they're more
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.480]   sinful than anybody else, it's because the rich man has a tendency to rely on himself.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.340]   And so there is no desperate spirit clinging to God.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.800]   And as a natural result of that, we tend to drift because we don't need God.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.680]   We don't need God to pay our bills.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.240]   We don't need God to take care of our children.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.880]   So it's good to have God, but it is not a necessity.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.960]   And as a result of that, we cling to him when we are reminded, when we have fellowship,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.680]   you might hear good sermons, or go to a conference and then you get jolted for a period, or you
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.080]   go to short-term missions.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.120]   But on a day-to-day basis, our natural tendency is to just conform to wherever we are.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   So if you happen to go to one church, you conform to whatever that church's standard
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   is.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   You happen to have a group of friends who do this, and you just naturally conform to
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   that.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.800]   And it's a little bit easier when you're in college because your community is primarily
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.480]   of Christians.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.720]   So whether you're at church, or you're at a CCM, or WACF, or whatever you go to, that's
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.960]   your natural flow when you're in college.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   But as soon as you graduate, you get a job, you have children, you are in the part of
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.480]   a regular society.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.040]   We're not reminded day-to-day like we were back in college.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.800]   On a day-to-day basis, we're constantly reminded that you don't fit in here, that you're not
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000]   like the rest of the people.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.160]   You're not like your CEO.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.400]   You're not like the salespeople who are getting ahead and getting great jobs.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.520]   We're constantly reminded we don't fit here.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.000]   So our natural tendency is, "Who wants to be a weirdo?"
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   So we drift, we forget, we learn how to function.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.720]   And so we're constantly coming to church just being reminded who we are.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.360]   Don't forget who we are because it doesn't take long for us to forget that.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.060]   Christ is our anchor.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.480]   Without Christ, the church can easily become a social club.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.160]   Without Christ, everything that you desire from the world, you can pursue it in the church.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.440]   I want honor, I want glory, I want recognition.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   All of that in the context of worshiping God and building a church.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.160]   So he's pounding over and over again.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.640]   Christ is superior to the angels, to Moses, to the prophets, to everybody.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.920]   That's basically, in a nutshell, the argument that the author has been making and will continue
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   to make.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.480]   And so the text that we're looking at this morning is a continuation of the argument
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.320]   of why Jesus is superior to the angels.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.940]   The goal of that is to get us to refocus on his glory and his promise.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.360]   So he starts in verse 5 saying, "It is not to the angels that the world will come that
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.680]   it's subject under, concerning which we are speaking."
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.600]   In other words, it's not about this world.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.720]   The world that we're going to go to, that's going to be permanent.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.980]   If we're confessing Christians, we all believe that we're just passing through and eventually
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.960]   we're going to end up into the kingdom of God where Christ is going to be the king and
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   he's going to reign forever.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.120]   He said in that kingdom, the angels are no longer going to be in charge.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.360]   And obviously when he's talking about angels here, Paul and other apostles have made it
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   very clear.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.040]   The God of this age is Satan.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.280]   The battle that we are engaging in is not politics, it's not about economy, it's not
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.000]   about the world system.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.480]   He says our struggle is against flesh and blood, rulers, against the powers, against
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.840]   the world forces in darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in this heavenly
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   place.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   So we've been reminded all over the New Testament that the angels have taken over the fallen
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.040]   world.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.100]   But the world that we are headed to is going to be reestablished with what God intended.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.620]   The text that we're looking at this morning basically covers redemptive history.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.860]   One of the questions I asked in the Facebook page about this passage is, "Is this section
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.740]   talking about Jesus or is it talking about man?"
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.100]   And I'm just going to answer it for you.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.500]   And I'm not going to go through, you know, to make my whole sermon try to convince you
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.540]   that he's talking about man because I think it's going to be fleshed out as we're going
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.340]   through it.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.400]   He's talking about man's history, where we stand before God, where we were and where
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.500]   we are now, and what Jesus is going to be doing about it.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.580]   So basically it's redemptive history in a nutshell.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.360]   And so where does Christ fit in with what's happening in history?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:50.980]   So if you want a concise history of God's creation, what happened, and where we stand
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:58.260]   now, and so why did Jesus come, what did he accomplish, and where he has taken us, it's
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.380]   Hebrews chapter 2.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.780]   So starting from verse 5 all the way to the end of the chapter, that's going to be his
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   primary argument.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.300]   So we're looking at the first part of it, right?
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.420]   Redemptive history.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.420]   Where do we come from?
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.620]   Where do we stand before God?
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:18.820]   So he starts by asking the question in verse 6, "But one has testified somewhere," right?
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.860]   In other words, first let's begin, where do we stand before God?
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.460]   What is man that you remember him, or the son of man that you are concerned about him?
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:35.380]   That question that he asks, it's a direct quote of David's quote as he is praying before
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.600]   God.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.420]   What is man?
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.820]   Who are we that you are so mindful of him?
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.040]   That question is the beginning of salvation.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.420]   In a nutshell, basically the question that he's asking is, "Why do you care?"
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.140]   That's the question that he's asking.
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.500]   The difference between a Christian who believes in a sovereign God and recognizes who God
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.020]   is and in light of that knows who he is, versus somebody who does not believe who God is,
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.420]   or maybe a Christian who rejects the sovereignty of God and who he is, or the goodness of God,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.740]   the question sounds similar but is a world apart.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:28.080]   And again, the psalmist is asking the question, "Why do you care?"
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.980]   In Psalm chapter 8, 3-4, "When I consider your heavens, the works of your fingers, the
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.220]   moon and the stars which you have ordained, what is man that you take thought of him and
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.660]   the son of man that you care for him?"
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.060]   The fundamental difference between somebody who knows God and recognizes him versus the
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.980]   world who rejects him is, the question that the world asks is, "Why don't you care?"
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   Why don't you care?
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.540]   When's the last time you talked to a non-Christian, tried to share the gospel with him, and said,
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.180]   "I can't believe God if..."
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.980]   Look at all the mess in the world.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.980]   Look at 9/11.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.100]   Why does he allow that to happen?
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.740]   Why does he allow sex trafficking?
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.580]   Why are there so many kids who are orphans?
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.500]   Why is HIV spreading all over the world?
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.180]   Why is this happening?
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.260]   Why doesn't he care?
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:22.580]   So until we satisfy that question, they said, "I can't accept your God," because why does
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:27.500]   he not care if he really is God?
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.620]   But the correct question that every human being should be asking is, "Why should he
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.160]   care?"
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.780]   He says, when he considers the heavens, when he considers the fingerprints of what he has
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:49.460]   made, the moon, the stars, in other words, the more he begins to understand the world,
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.380]   the natural question that he comes to is not, "Why does the God who created all of this
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.840]   not care about me?"
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.420]   Because that's a foolish question.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.640]   I mean, if a famous movie star or a rock star said, "Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?"
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.520]   As he is running out of the stadium, he looks over and sees you, and he said, "Hey, hey,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   who are you?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   Come here."
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   You'd be like, "Me?
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.380]   Why are you interested in me?
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   What did I do?
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.960]   Are you going to give me?"
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.720]   And so even by the fact that he pointed to you and asked you to come down, automatically
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   you feel special.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.120]   He picked me out of thousands of people to engage me.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   Now, I have no idea what he's going to do.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.520]   He didn't give me anything, but just the fact that he recognized me, he's like, "Oh, me?
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.440]   Yeah, me."
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.000]   But it is a foolish question to ask, considering all that we know about the universe, that
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.120]   the question that the speck, in light of the universe, would ask, "Why don't you care?"
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.720]   It'd be a foolish thing.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.160]   Again, if you were to reverse that in the stadium, and let's say LeBron James is running
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.000]   out and said, "You, you, you," and then the guy next to him is like, "What a jerk.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.360]   Why didn't he call me?"
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.200]   And you have thousands of people leaving the stadium, it's like, "Why didn't he call me?"
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.320]   That would be a foolish question.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.440]   Why should he call you?
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   Who are you?
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.000]   He's busy, he's tired, he's running into the locker room to get ready for whatever else,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.600]   to go home, to relax.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.120]   Why does he have to call you?
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.260]   That question in itself is an arrogant question that does not understand who he is.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.600]   He doesn't understand who he is, he doesn't understand who God is.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.080]   And that's why that question in itself is an arrogant question.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.100]   Fundamentally, is a man who does not understand who he is.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.240]   You kill a bug, you don't think about how that's immoral.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.080]   You don't think about how, you don't think about that bug's family, children, where he's
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   buried.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.160]   You don't think about any of that, right?
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.680]   You just kill it because it's annoying.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   You don't want it in your house.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.000]   Who are we to this God of the universe?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.240]   Have you ever seen how small, how small we are in the light of the galaxy?
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   You ever seen the comparison?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.600]   Earth itself, you can't see the earth.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.800]   You almost need a microscope to see the earth and we are a speck on this earth.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.480]   And that speck comes to a God who created all of this, sustains all of this.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:38.460]   Everything is made by him and for his glory, is asking the question, "Why don't you care?"
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   Already in that question there is rebellion.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.820]   Already in that question there is sinfulness.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.800]   Why would he care?
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.940]   And so when you begin our contact with God as, "Why don't you care?"
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.880]   We become the judge and he becomes the person that we are judging.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.040]   And so the world is judging him saying like, "Well, if you care, you should be doing this.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.100]   If you care, you should be doing that."
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.720]   But a man who recognizes who he is, comes before God and the fundamental question is,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.100]   "Why does he care?"
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.720]   Why does he care that we have fallen?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.900]   Why does he care that we are in rebellion?
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.780]   Why would he care to send his only begotten son?
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.120]   Why?
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.240]   What is man that you are mindful of him?
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.660]   He doesn't even talk about, "What is man that you would send his only begotten son to be
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.380]   crucified and take up my sins?"
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.580]   He says, "No, what is man that you are even thinking of him?"
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.860]   That's the Old Testament version of that.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.300]   In the New Testament, it goes way beyond that.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   David is just asking, "Why do you care?
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.900]   Why do you even know my name?"
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.500]   But in the New Covenant, "Oh my God, that's...
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.220]   I mean, why do you even know my name?
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.220]   Not only did he call my name, he called me out, put on the jersey, right?
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.060]   Said, "Hey, do you need a ride home?
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   Took me home.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   I was hungry."
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.900]   "The only dollar that he had, he used it for me."
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.580]   I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.540]   Why would he care?
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.940]   Until we come to that point, we recognize who he is and recognize who we are, we will
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:24.860]   never see who he is because we're examining him to judge him.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.380]   Psalm 90, verse 12 is a passage that I quoted last week.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:34.460]   It says, "So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.820]   Why do we need to number our days?
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.380]   One, to recognize that this life is fleeting.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.980]   The things that matter so much from day to day is fleeting.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.940]   Just like if you were to travel and you know that you're going to come home, you're not
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.220]   going to go and see the price of the buildings and how you're going to invest and you're
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.180]   going to purchase stuff that you can't bring home because you know you're not going to
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   be here.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.060]   So in other words, one, help us to see how fleeting this life is.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.260]   So we do not build and invest in things that's going to perish.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   Invest in things that are eternal.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:18.100]   But not only is this talking about the larger life and how fleeting it is, but our insignificance.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:27.220]   Recognizing in light of eternity, we're just a flash that comes and we disappear.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.500]   Every once in a while somebody would ask, you know, you should write a book or you should
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:38.420]   say this or you should do that, and you've got to work hard to build a legacy.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.540]   And that's a thing that I hear more these days.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   Legacy.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540]   Building a legacy.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.540]   How are people going to remember you?
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.340]   What a futile attempt to prolong our life.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.020]   We come, we go.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.820]   By next generation, no one's going to know who Peter Kim is.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.420]   I'm not sure if this church is going to be around, to be honest.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.300]   In another 30 years, who knows?
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.060]   And I'm not trying to be fatalistic.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.260]   I'm not like cup is half empty type of guy.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.500]   I'm not saying that.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.140]   It's just history.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:21.140]   I mean there are churches that men of God stood like Charles Spurgeon, that the church
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.620]   is just an empty shell now.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.860]   And it's not because they weren't faithful.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.820]   It wasn't because God didn't use them powerfully.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.700]   I mean we read his books, we know all that, but you go to their church, it's empty.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.020]   So I can only be faithful to what God has given today, but like I'm, what happens tomorrow,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.980]   that's in God's hands.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.540]   We're just here today and gone tomorrow.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:50.780]   He says, "Teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.600]   Until we are humble before God, we are useless.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:02.020]   The moment that you begin to think that I have knowledge, I have education, I have experience,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:12.220]   you know, and I knew somebody years ago who told me that he thinks that Japan, the reason
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:17.260]   why they are not receptive to the gospel as a whole is because they didn't send the right
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   people.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.860]   You know, meaning that if we had the right training, if we had the right gifted guys
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.380]   and we go there, you know why, years and years and years of people have gone and the arrogance
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:35.700]   to think that if we just sent the right people, that revival would break out.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:42.740]   Until we recognize our weakness before God, we don't pray.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.740]   Prayer is the first thing that we do when we recognize that we're weak.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.420]   Not just to get the task done, but even to decipher my own heart.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:59.020]   If I'm not regularly in the Word of God and being judged by my thoughts and my intention,
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.780]   and I think like, "Oh, if we just apply this, and you know, last time I did this and it
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.140]   worked, so let's do that and do this over here."
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.460]   There's nothing wrong with any of that, but if our first encounter with God, if the first
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:16.020]   thing that God doesn't convict us is how weak we are and how fleeting we are and how dependent
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.140]   we are on Him, everything we build on top of that would be vanity.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.500]   That's why the heart of wisdom, the beginning of wisdom is recognizing our need.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   Who are we?
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.540]   Why do you care?
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:38.900]   How do you save somebody who doesn't recognize the need to be saved?
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.260]   Simple answer, you can't.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.540]   John 8, 31-33, and I want to look at this passage.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.500]   So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, and remember that, believing
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   Jews.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.740]   Jesus was preaching about the kingdom of God, Jews were hearing it, and He's talking to
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.100]   a group of people who said that they believed.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.700]   If you continue my words, then you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth,
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.980]   and the truth will make you free.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:15.420]   So Jesus continues saying, this is the way to the kingdom, to allow the Son of God, Son
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.540]   of Man to set you free.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   They answered Him, we are Abram's descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.340]   How is it that you say you will become free?
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.660]   They were offended, because when Jesus said they needed to be set free, they were probably
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.760]   thinking of the indentured servants.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.100]   They were on the lowest of the totem pole.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.420]   These guys, if you went into society, they would have the last seat of wherever they
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.420]   went.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.980]   And when Jesus says, I've come to set you free, it's like, free?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.020]   We're children of Abraham, we've never been enslaved, so they were offended.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.900]   How can you say that?
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:20:00.620]   See, as long as Jesus was talking about the kingdom, the leaders loved John the Baptist
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.020]   and Jesus in the beginning.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.460]   Do you remember when you read the Gospels, in the very beginning part of their ministry,
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:13.220]   the Pharisees and the leaders came all the way from Jerusalem to check Him out.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.540]   If He's the Messiah, we need to get close to that guy.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:22.340]   They were all coming out until Jesus and John the Baptist called them out and said, who
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.900]   told you to come here?
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.320]   Bear fruit in accordance to repentance.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:36.820]   It wasn't until they were called out for their sins that they started to turn on Him.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:41.860]   They refused to recognize who they were before God.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.820]   Until we recognize who we are, we will never be able to truly understand what He means
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.540]   for us.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:58.940]   Our love for Him goes up and down based upon finances, relationships, circumstance.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.100]   He's good when things look great, and where is God?
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.740]   How come He doesn't care when things don't work out the way we hope for?
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.700]   But the question that every believer should be asking every single day, why does He even
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.700]   care?
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.740]   Do you remember the book of Job?
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.380]   Satan comes and asks, you know, only reason why He's a godly man is because you protected
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.940]   Him with a hedge.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.380]   Take that away and let me at Him and see what kind of man He is.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.380]   And so that's what happens.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.580]   He just, God gives Him permission, Satan goes at it.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.380]   And then the book of Job is three cycles of three of His friends coming and saying, you
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.100]   know what, God doesn't just punish anybody.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.540]   You must have done something wrong.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.100]   And so the book of Job is a cycle of Job defending himself.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.420]   I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.540]   I'm a righteous man.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.280]   I have no idea why God is doing this to me.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.180]   So the whole book of Job is Job standing up for his righteousness and his friends saying,
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.740]   no, there must be something.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:04.700]   Well, at the end of his suffering, he loses his family, his children, his wealth, and
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.300]   then his even own health.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.380]   I mean, he is suffocating to death.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   And he finally snaps and he comes to God and he says, God, why are you doing this to me?
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.300]   I was a righteous man.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.520]   I did everything that you told me to do.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.580]   Why are you doing this to me?
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:28.460]   And then finally, when his pride breaks and his friends get to him and his circumstance
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.100]   gets to him and he begins to cry out to God, why don't you care?
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.060]   Why are you not allowing this to happen to me?
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.740]   God finally shows up.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.380]   And when God shows up, he doesn't explain.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.380]   There is no explanation.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.100]   Well, this happened because Satan asked permission and so this was my goal.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.820]   He doesn't ask for any of that.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.940]   God shows up and he tells Job, put on your big boy pants, right?
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.940]   Or gird up your loins, right?
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940]   That's the actual words.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.700]   But basically, that's what he's saying.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.580]   I'm going to talk to you like a man, right?
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.300]   And I'm going to speak to you and you're just going to listen.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.520]   All God says is, where were you when I created the universe?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.100]   Do you understand the ways of the gazelle?
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.180]   Do you understand the ways of the whale?
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.740]   Do you understand when I created the universe, when I told the ocean to stop right here and
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.740]   they stopped?
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.980]   Do you understand any of this?
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.980]   Do you understand the leopard?
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.980]   Do you understand the way of a child?
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.260]   And he just goes long list of what he did in creation.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.420]   Where were you?
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.980]   And you're there judging me?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.860]   You're asking the question, why do you not care?
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.020]   And you're examining me.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.860]   I'm going to examine you.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:44.780]   And then he goes, upcycle, put on your big boy pants, and I'm going to walk you through
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.380]   who I am, and that's what he does.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:58.140]   At the tail end of that, Job sees his glory and he recognizes what he has done.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.900]   And this is what he says, Job chapter 42, 36.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.780]   Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.180]   He's talking about himself.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.900]   Therefore, I have declared that which I did not understand.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.460]   Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:19.180]   Hear now and I will speak, I will ask you and you instruct me.
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:24.780]   I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eyes sees you, therefore I
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.780]   retract.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.460]   What is he retracting?
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.940]   The whole book of Job was defending his righteousness.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.180]   The whole book of Job was trying to figure out, I've done nothing wrong, why did you
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.660]   allow this to happen?
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.440]   Why are you allowing this to happen?
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.940]   And then at the tail end, God, you are unfair.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.620]   And so he's retracting all that.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.980]   I had no idea what I was talking about, and then I repent in dust and ashes.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.220]   In other words, what is he saying?
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:04.740]   When I consider the heavens and the stars and the moons, who am I that you would even
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.320]   be mindful of me?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.180]   Why do you even care that I suffer?
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.180]   Why do you even care?
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:16.220]   Why do you even show up and talk to me?
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.660]   And it leads him to repentance.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:27.340]   Until we recognize who we are before God, the gospel will not make sense.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:35.100]   Until we recognize who it is that we are approaching, worship just becomes superstition.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.540]   They just come and put in your time and give you an offering and hopefully if I've done
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   good things that God will bless my life and bless my children, but you will not understand
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.040]   the gospel.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.300]   The beginning of wisdom is recognizing who he is and who we are and where we stand in
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.940]   his presence.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.660]   He says, first of all, he says, "Who are we?"
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:01.140]   And then the second he says in verse 7 through 9, to realize that in the end, God created
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.380]   us to have glory and honor, verse 7 through 9.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.220]   You have made him for a little while lower than the angels.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.380]   You have crowned him with glory and honor and have appointed him over the works of your
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380]   hands.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.220]   You have put all things in subjection under his feet, for in subjecting all things to
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.220]   him he left nothing that is not subject to him.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:25.720]   Everything he says here, verses 7, 8, and 9, is pointing back to the creation.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.940]   This is exactly, if you want to like word for word, for the sake of time, I'm not going
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.340]   to read the whole passage, but what he says in verse 7, 8, and 9, that's exactly what
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.700]   he says in creation.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.980]   In Genesis chapter 2, verse 7, "The Lord God formed man of dust from the ground and breathed
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.500]   into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being."
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.900]   We are not like animals.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.020]   God created the animals and he says he created them in their kind, over and over again.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.540]   He created them in their kind.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.500]   He created the cattle in their kind.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.580]   He created the beast in their kind.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:08.020]   But when he comes to man in verse 6, 26, God said, "Let us make man in our image, according
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.500]   to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.060]   sky, and over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.060]   on the earth."
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.620]   He said he distinguished us from the rest of creation.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:29.900]   He put his own image upon us, so that when the rest of the creation saw us, mankind,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.660]   that they would see God's glory off of us.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.880]   And because they saw God's glory off of us, they would be in submission.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.260]   That's how he created the universe.
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.180]   Verse 27, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.220]   Male and female he created them."
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.620]   You know what's going on right now, this gender neutrality thing?
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.340]   At the core of it is satanic rebellion against God.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:02.060]   I know some of you may, I don't know what your background is, but I make that very clear.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.420]   Male and female he created it.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:12.080]   To erase the gender between male and female is an ultimate rebellion against God's creation.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.540]   God had declared us male and female to interact, to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.260]   It is part of his creation.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.380]   It is part of his design.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.740]   And yet Satan is attacking that.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.900]   And he says, you know, we say, we live in a country where we, you know, I believe it's
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:36.700]   a great country, United States, you know, we're all born with inalienable rights, right?
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.080]   But where does this right come from?
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.860]   Just because you declared it?
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.620]   Just because you said I have it?
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.580]   I can't walk into a department store and I have a right over these products, right?
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.660]   You can't say that.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.020]   Who gave you that right?
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.260]   It's what authority.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.820]   You can't just come out of nowhere and say, I have these rights.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:06.700]   The reason why mankind has certain glory is because God created us to reflect his image.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.580]   We're not like animals.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.580]   We're not dogs.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.780]   That's why when the Bible describes a man who's in rebellion against God and he returns
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.820]   back to his sin, he describes what?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.260]   A dog returning to its vomit.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.060]   When a dog returns from its vomit, we don't say, oh, what kind of a disgusting dog is
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.060]   that?
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.180]   Well, that's a dog.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.820]   Dogs do that when they get hungry.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:34.860]   He said, but a man who does that is outside of his nature.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.060]   He's in rebellion against God and his sin.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:43.900]   The reason why there is dignity in man, in all mankind, why there's value even in an
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:52.420]   unborn child is because God declared his glory upon every human being.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.420]   It is not innately.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.860]   He didn't declare it for himself.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.980]   He didn't all of a sudden randomly have dignity.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.420]   If God does not exist, if God didn't place his image upon us, we are no different than
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.900]   animals, just because we're smarter than the animals?
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.980]   He said, no.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.820]   Our dignity and our glory comes from the very reason why we were created, to reflect his
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.300]   glory.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.700]   But he says in verse 8, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him."
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:31.540]   That's what God intended, and that's why man is of value, because we were created in his
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:39.660]   image, but as of now, that's not what we experience.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:46.260]   You know, years ago, when we would go out to Santa Ana and feed the homeless, and there
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   was this one particular girl, even to this day, she stands out, because she must have
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:56.100]   been about 5'7", 5'8", blonde hair, blue eyes, she looked like a cheerleader, and she's just
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   so out of place.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.580]   We would be there every Tuesday feeding the homeless, and that area that we were feeding
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.020]   the homeless is not a place that a young girl should be walking around.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.420]   Well, she was out there, and I was kind of curious, because we would always see her about
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   a block away.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.940]   She would never come to where we are, and obviously it caught our attention, "What's
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.940]   that girl doing here?
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.940]   What's that girl doing here?"
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:22.020]   And then eventually, we got to ask one of the guys who would come, and they would feed,
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.380]   and he said, "Well, that girl's hooked on crack."
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.460]   It was a period of time when crack cocaine was just spreading rampantly, and she got
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.460]   hooked on crack.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.700]   So I don't know what her family background was, I don't know what was happening in her
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.700]   life, but she just didn't fit.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.140]   And we didn't see her every single week, but every once in a while, we would see her out
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.580]   there on the street and found out that she, you know, when young pretty girls come out
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:51.420]   there for their own safety, they have to get attached to an older or stronger guy for protection.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.620]   We found out that she was selling her body to get crack, and then she got attached to
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.980]   this one of the bigger guys for protection, and you could see her deterioration.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.940]   And after about a year period, we would see her every once in a while, and you would have
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.500]   never known that that girl that we saw a year later was that same girl that we saw a year
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.900]   ago, because of what the drug did to her.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.460]   It's her hair, it's her appearance.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:25.540]   The Bible describes mankind as created in glory, in honor, to reflect God.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:33.300]   Everything that we love about God, God created us in creation to reflect that glory.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.500]   And in that glory, we were to represent Him to the rest of creation, to rule over it,
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.820]   to subdue it.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.260]   Think about creation, I mean, it'd be awesome, you know, when we think about heaven, you
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.420]   know, everybody has their own imagination, but much of it is not biblical.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.140]   You think about, "Oh, when I get there, I'm going to have mansions."
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.820]   Mansion itself is a creation of a fallen world, right?
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.180]   Why do we have walls?
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.020]   Because we don't want weirdos coming into our house for protection.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:11.220]   The fact that we have homes, we have clothes, we have walls, we have doors, we have gates,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.780]   these are all byproducts of a fallen world.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.100]   If you go to heaven, when there is no sin, there's no perpetrators, there is no shame,
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.300]   there's no need for a home.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.940]   The weather's going to be perfect all the time, that's my, I don't know, I just made
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.780]   that up, I'm just thinking, maybe, right?
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.380]   But there is no need for protection.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.880]   There's no need for walls.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.760]   There's no need for locks.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.380]   There's no need for alarms.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.260]   You said in the creation, they walked around without shame, and the animals would come,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:49.300]   and they were naming these animals, and they were happy.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.260]   There was no misunderstanding between husband and wife.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.620]   I said this, and they're like, "Well, I didn't mean that, but you did say it."
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.620]   Right?
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.020]   None of that in creation.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.060]   There's no misunderstanding between friends.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.820]   Animals would come and say, "Lion."
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:11.140]   You know, it's kind of a side thing, but I was thinking about if the Chinese culture
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.140]   named everything.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.540]   This is completely off the wall.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.780]   It's completely off the wall.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.700]   It has nothing to do with what I'm talking about, but I just had a thought.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.900]   You know one thing I really like about the Chinese culture?
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.700]   They're very simple in the way that they name everything.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   Right?
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.860]   So you know exactly what dish you're getting when you order in a Chinese restaurant.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.780]   It's cabbage over nuts.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.500]   Like that's what comes out.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   Right?
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.380]   Or you order a stir-fry, you know, whatever, and that's exactly what comes out.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.660]   So I'm thinking like if a Chinese person was naming the animals, it'd be like, you know,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.540]   big cat, small cat, black cat, furry cat.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.620]   So you know exactly what.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.020]   Anyway, that has nothing to do with anything, but I was just thinking about it.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.020]   Right?
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:59.700]   Now I've got to get back to my sermon.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.580]   I mean, that was the creation.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:06.020]   When you look at Genesis chapter 1 and 2, before the fall, it was paradise.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:12.580]   He said, "But now that's not what we see."
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:19.660]   And the reason why is because in Isaiah chapter 14, 12 through 15, it describes Satan's fall,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.820]   Lucifer's fall, and this is what it says.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:27.620]   How you have fallen from heaven, O star of morning, Lucifer, literally, son of the dawn.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.660]   You have been cut down to the earth, you who have weakened the nations.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.740]   You said in your heart, I will ascend to heaven and I will raise my throne above the stars
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.900]   of God and I will sit on the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.860]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.980]   I will make myself like the most high.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:53.380]   Nevertheless, you will be thrust down to the recesses of the pit.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.900]   The power of Satan's rebellion is he saw the glory of God and said, "I want that."
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.340]   And he tempted Adam and Eve, "You can be like God too."
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.220]   And then when mankind began to multiply, they used all their resources and built the Tower
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.900]   of Babel to do what?
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.300]   To be like God.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:20.080]   All of human history is challenging and wanting to usurp where God is.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:28.220]   And the reason why is because that's at the center of Satan's rebellion.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.420]   And he's trying to recruit people to do the same.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.220]   There's a reason why Jesus, at the very end of his life, before he goes to the cross,
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:43.140]   the last thing that he teaches his disciples, he humbles himself and he washes their feet.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.980]   And then he says, "He who is the greatest on the earth is the least in the kingdom.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.940]   He who is the least will be the greatest in the kingdom of God."
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.260]   He wasn't just simply teaching them life lesson on how to be good citizens.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.660]   Like if you just kind of humble yourself and take care of yourself, you would have a great
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.460]   church that you can enjoy.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:09.100]   That's true, but he was telling something much more profound and deeper than that.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:15.240]   Because at the heart of Satan's rebellion and mankind's rebellion is he wants to recapture
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.780]   that glory outside of Christ.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:26.180]   There's a reason why Paul calls everything he lost "dung."
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.220]   Because in light of who Jesus is, you know, the whole world is playing a game like the
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.460]   king of the hill, right?
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460]   You guys all play king of the hill?
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:38.180]   King of the hill is basically the guy, toughest guy, is up on the top and everybody's trying
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.260]   to throw him off.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.820]   And then at the end of the game, whoever's at the top wins.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.660]   That's king of the hill.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.620]   In a nutshell, that's what the world is like.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.340]   We're all playing king of the hill.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.620]   We invite the guy who's on top.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:57.340]   And we're not necessarily swinging and hitting people, but we're working hard to get education
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.580]   and make the right decision, raise up our children, all so that we can be the king of
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   the hill.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:11.180]   But the problem is even if you win the game, you became the king of a dung hill.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:20.820]   Until we recognize who he is and who we are, you will never understand why he came.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.020]   We will continue to fight to be a little bit higher on this dung hill.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:31.180]   And that's why Paul says in light of Christ, everything became dung in light of who he
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.620]   is.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.260]   And that's why he's bringing us back to Christ and his glory.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.180]   Until we see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, until we see the glory that we fell
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:51.980]   from, that we reflected, then what he has done will only be a good story.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.740]   I'm not going to go into that today, but I'm just going to give you a preview.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.780]   And obviously we know how it goes.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:04.260]   He says, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him, but we do see him," referring
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.500]   to Jesus, "who was made for a little while lower than the angels, because that's where
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.540]   we were."
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.500]   So basically he came to get us.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.940]   Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory, honored so that by the
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.100]   grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.140]   Let me conclude by reading this one passage where it tells us where we are headed.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.740]   In Romans 8, 15 to 17, "For you have not received the spirit of slavery, leading to fear again,
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.500]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.780]   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:50.060]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God, fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.940]   with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:59.380]   I pray that the promises of God and the vision of Christ, even a glimpse that we've seen,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.300]   would cause us to see this world as God sees it.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:09.780]   And that every single day we would be asking the question, "Why do you care?
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.020]   Who am I that you know my name?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.340]   Who am I that you give me this promise?"
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.580]   And I pray that that would lead to a heart of worship before God.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.780]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come.
