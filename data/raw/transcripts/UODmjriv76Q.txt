[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.060]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.140]   For those of you guys who are there in the back hallway,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.720]   please make your way to your seats.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.840]   We are gonna get started in just a moment.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.100]   As you entered in,
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.480]   you should have received a prayer guide for tonight.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   If you don't have one, you can, on your devices,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.100]   go to our Facebook, and the prayer guide is there.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.940]   Post it.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.720]   It's also on our app if you just look at Sunday worship,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.440]   and then just go to the lyrics portion of it.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   You'll see the notes for tonight there as well.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.320]   So it's an absolute privilege for us to come together
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.060]   and seek the Lord in prayer.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.020]   Let's begin bowing our heads, praying together,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.320]   and then we'll have a time of worship tonight.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.160]   Let's pray.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.360]   Heavenly Father, we are so grateful to you, God.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.580]   Lord, to consider that we can lift up to you
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.860]   our requests, our thoughts.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.320]   God, that we can approach you in this way.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.620]   Lord, we are filled with gratitude.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.700]   Father, we're thankful that we are able to call you
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.240]   our Abba Father, and Lord God, to seek from you
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.460]   your blessings as our heavenly Lord.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.840]   And so I ask, God, that when we come,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.700]   Lord, that we will come to you with eagerness, Father,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.380]   to seek your presence, eagerness, Lord,
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.540]   to hear your instruction, eagerness, Father God,
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.400]   to connect with you first and foremost.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.340]   I also pray, Father God, that tonight,
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.760]   as the church is gathered, Lord, may this be
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.260]   a blessed time, as an opportunity for us
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.300]   to lift up to you our hearts of worship.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.140]   As we sing to you, God, as we lift you up,
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.640]   Lord, we pray that you would be honored
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.420]   and that you would be blessed.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.040]   And so, God, tonight, as we again spend this time,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.100]   we pray that it would be a time that is pleasing
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.700]   in your sight and a blessing to us, Lord.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.040]   Father, we lift this time up to you.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.640]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.060]   - All right, would you all please stand with us?

[00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   [piano]
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   What a friend we have in Jesus,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   all our sins and griefs to bear.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   What a privilege to carry
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   everything to God in prayer.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   oh, what needless pain we know,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:05.320]   all because we do not carry
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   everything to God in prayer.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   Have we trials and temptations?
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   Is there trouble anywhere?
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   We should never be discouraged
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   to get to the Lord in prayer.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:53.320]   Can we find a friend so faithful
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   who will all our sorrow bear?
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   Jesus knows our every weakness,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   Are we weak and heavy laden,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   clumbered with a load of care?
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   Has your Savior still our refuge?
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   Do thy friends despise forsaken thee?
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   In His arms we'll take and share,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   faith that will find us all this day.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   [piano]
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   Blessed Savior, blessed Savior,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   thou hast promised
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   thou wilt all our burdens bear.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   May we ever, Lord, be brave
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   unto thee in earnest prayer.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   Soon in glory bright and clouded
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   there will be no need for prayer.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   Rapture, praise and endless worship
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   there be our sweet portion there.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   Rapture, praise and endless worship

[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   All right, good evening again, everyone.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   Just to mention again,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   for those of you who don't have the prayer guide for tonight,
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   it is on the public Facebook group.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   Also on our church app, it's underneath our Sunday.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   And if you just tap lyrics, you'll see the notes for tonight.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   We want to have our extended prayer time
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   just like we did in the previous Praise and Prayer,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   where I'm going to take about 5, 10 minutes
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   to go over various topics to inspire you to pray.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   And then we'll give you a chunk of time
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   so that you can have an extended time
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   for you to pray before the Lord.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   So that you're not confined to these things,
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   but using these as a guide for you
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   to help you along in that time.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   And tonight, as a way of just introducing
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   a lot of these topics,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   I want us to think about really reflecting
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   and having introspection
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   on the various topics that are shown in Scripture.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   The very first thing I want to highlight
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   is we want to always be praying for the glory of God.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   That we want to see God exalted in our lives,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.320]   and that that should be at the highest of our priority.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   Every single one of us, we have certain ideas
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   of the success we want to achieve in our lives.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   Every single one of us, through various seasons of life,
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   we have certain agendas.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   Sometimes we have felt needs.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   Individually, we have etc. and etc.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   But what we want to say is,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   not that any of those things are horrendous and bad,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   but that above and beyond all those things,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   that we are seeking the glory of God.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   And it's a great opportunity for us, collectively,
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.320]   to be praying that tonight.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   But by way of self-reflection,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   to be more specific,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.320]   we want to ask some of these questions.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   So I have some questions there for you to reflect on.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   If this is really the heart's cry of every Christian,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   that God should be glorified in my life,
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   then there's a question to be asked of,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   have you made recent decisions
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   where God then was considered?
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   What is most glorifying to the Lord in these decisions?
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   Are you right now going through some pivotal moments?
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   Are you having to make certain decision calls?
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   And the question is, have you considered the Lord?
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   Are you working through that?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   We obviously, again, have various ambitions for our careers,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   what we want our family life to be like.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   And the question is, have these ambitions
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   have at the forefront of it, the question of,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   is this glorifying to God?
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   So take that time to just ask the question,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   the stuff that I'm doing now,
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   the decisions that I'm making now,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   does it have any reference to the Lord?
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   And so, moving to the next part of it,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   we want to make sure that when we think about praying
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   about the glory of God and seeing the glory of God in our lives,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   we want to make sure to avoid this generation's,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   what I like to say, like greatest tendency,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   which is a lot of times to think that God is obligated
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   to provide for us certain benefits,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   to make of God as we wish,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   and to hope that he's going to come along onto our agenda.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   But let's really pray that we're going to be growing
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   in the knowledge of God as high and exalted, amen?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   Moving to number two, we want to pray then
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   for a heart of adoration and thankfulness to God,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   and one of the primary ways to fight that common tendency we have,
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   where we're seeking of God to constantly receive, receive,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   is to make sure that our hearts are so thankful.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   So by way of reflection, take time as you pray
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.320]   to think through and maybe even just list, right?
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   In what ways have God given you so much provision?
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   In what ways has God in his fatherly love given you protection,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   instruction and guidance, wisdom and so forth?
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   Be able to highlight those things and reflect upon your situation now
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   so that you can be full with gratitude and appreciation
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   for what God is doing in your life currently.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   So, in various situations we experience his kind intention,
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   sometimes we experience his power,
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   but every single day we experience his provision.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   So let's make sure we're thanking God for that.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Moving to number three, okay?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   We want to be praying that our eyes are like Christ
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   and our heart towards other people are like Christ as well.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   I think right now we should be praying for how we
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   essentially engage other people, you know?
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   Again, we are in a unique situation, perhaps scenario politically,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   in people's ideologies, and I have a funny question here.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   It's, "Are there any specific people that you've called fool?"
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   You know that in the Scriptures, okay, in the Scriptures,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   Jesus talks about how if you hate a brother
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   and call him, "You fool, good for nothing," right?
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.320]   God's going to actually hold you accountable for that.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   But right now in the debates and the back and forth,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   there is a lot of animosity where people are just calling each other
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   all sorts of heinous things.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   Well, take some time to reflect, like,
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   are there people that are getting on, you know, your bad side, your odds?
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   You know, are you frustrated?
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Have you had any kind of bitterness and resentment towards individuals?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   Because what we're praying for is the heart and eyes of Christ,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   that we're not seeing people as, like, just purely our enemies,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   potential threats and risks, maybe even costly to us, right?
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   We're actually praying for hearts that are redemptive
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   and wanting even to lift up in prayer those individuals.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   So my guess is every single one of us,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   we have certain relationships that rub completely the wrong way.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   Let's really take time to pray for those things.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   Okay, let's move to number four in describing this prayer,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   some of the topics in self-reflection here.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   Let's take time to really pray for our sanctification.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   Now, that's really broad.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   But please take time to consider,
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   are there specific patterns of sin in your thought
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   or specific patterns of sin in your speech,
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   specific patterns of sin that's expressed itself over time, right?
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   I think we really want to make sure that in this day,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   we want to fight against the very common struggles
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   that we experience every day.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   And it's really good to at least take some time to review.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   Is my heart given to materialism where the fantasy daydreams of my--
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   you know, every day has with it tons of everything that I can purchase
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   and everything that I can own and collect, right?
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   Perhaps you have to ask yourself the questions of,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   are there these lusts for just pure pleasure?
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   Am I seeking nothing but simple pleasures in my life?
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   Are there roots of bitterness taking place in your heart?
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   Are there destructive words that are constantly coming out of your mouth
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   and you've been so accustomed to where if something upsets you,
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   immediately stuff comes out?
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   Now, I can keep going on, but my question is, are there observable things
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   that you can identify, patterns of sin in your life?
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   Pray that God would give you victory over those things.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   Pray that God would help you remove those things from your life.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   The other thing I want to just quickly mention,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   I think that is absolutely needed for us,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   is pray that God would sanctify you by strengthening you
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   to overcome daily fatigue.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   I think I've said it many times, like in this generation,
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   we're not necessarily persecuted from every angle,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   but nevertheless, so many things just simply tire us out day to day.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   And we are, by ourselves and our flesh, weak individuals.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   We're just simply fatigued and being tired
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   could cause us to just drag our knuckles in following after God.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   And so let's pray for strength for every day.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   Number five, number five.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   Let's pray for those evangelistic opportunities and to really seize them.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   We want to make sure that we have a spiritual focus.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   We want to make sure that we are not succumbing to the,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   "Well, it's COVID, it's too hard" mentality,
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   but rather still looking for opportunities
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   and making room for those opportunities
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   and actually identifying where those chances may be,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   where God is leading.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   So whether it be your workplace, your home, or your school,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   let's take time to actually specifically ask,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   "Where can I actually make room?"
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   Right? "Am I going to work?"
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   Like, "Just as you know, I need to get stuff done."
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   And as soon as it's time, you're bouncing without any room for side conversations?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   Are you maxing out your lunch break in order to just get that nap in plus the lunch?
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Or are you leaving room for those opportunities
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   and then think about the people that are there in that space,
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   like where you are, and lift them up in prayer.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   Okay?
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   And let's keep praying that we are bold
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   and that we have clarity in our witness
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   that our speech and our actions shine bright. Amen?
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   Okay.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   Now I know all those topics are generalized topics of glory to God,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   loving others, right?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   Sanctification and evangelizing.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   Like, those are the general topics we regularly pray for.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.320]   But again, one of the themes for tonight is
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   when we pray, it is a great opportunity to say,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   "Lord, this is my heart on the table.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Everything I'm thinking, stuff that I'm doing,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   I want to lay before you so that God, you would watch them.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   You would sanctify those things."
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   So within each topic, please make sure you're asking yourself those questions
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   and reflecting. Amen?
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Okay.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   At this time, just like we did in the previous Praise and Prayer,
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   we're going to turn to our neighbor and ask them,
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   "How can I pray for you?"
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   But just so that it's a little bit more, okay, facilitated and not so crazy,
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   just do it in pairs.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   If there's three of you guys right there, you can do it in threes.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   But just turn to your neighbor, and in prayer,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   I'm going to give you three, four minutes to just ask,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   "How can I pray for you?"
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.320]   And then we'll bring us back, and then we'll have extended time.

[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.200]   And afterwards, we'll wrap up
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.160]   and end with the closing praise song, okay?
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.600]   So let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.880]   Father God, as we as a church collectively
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.480]   bow our heads before you and seek you in prayer,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.820]   Father, we are so thankful, God,
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.760]   that in you there is wisdom, truth,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.600]   discretion, and all knowledge.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   We thank you, Father God, that you have eyes
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.360]   a flame of fire, and Lord, that you see through everything.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.760]   And in many ways, Father God, we want to acknowledge, God,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.560]   you know us better than we know ourselves.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.480]   And so we pray, Lord, that as we come to you in prayer,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   lifting up to you both our struggles,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.980]   our faith, our sins, our internal thoughts,
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.860]   all these things, again, we pray
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.900]   that you would transform us.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.120]   Lord, I pray, Father God, that in this prayer time,
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.780]   as we lift up to you the request
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.860]   that you would sanctify us, Lord,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.140]   we do in your mercies hear us.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   And God, that you continue to lead us
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.340]   in the blessing of being changed every day.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.500]   God, being conformed to the image of your son
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.580]   and having the ministry of your truth in us
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.700]   and your spirit in us, be so powerful.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.900]   We want to thank you again for this time,
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.940]   and pray, Father God, that, Lord, you would lead us.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.520]   It's in Christ's name, amen.

[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.940]   we're gonna conclude our extended period of prayer,
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.640]   and I'll say a prayer for us to wrap up.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.760]   And then our worship team is gonna come up
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.340]   and lead us in a closing song.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.340]   So let's take a moment to pray together.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:34.840]   Our God,
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.940]   our prayer is that we, as individuals
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.480]   and collectively as a church,
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.900]   would truly continue to grow
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.640]   in our sight of who you are.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.800]   Lord, that we would recognize you
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.300]   as truly the powerful God,
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.060]   the absolute sovereign God,
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.720]   who has saved us and who is leading us now.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.680]   And so we pray that, God,
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.300]   the regular pattern of our day
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.520]   would be to depend on you,
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.020]   would be to go to you for everything.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.840]   And Father God, I pray that in that way,
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.560]   that the ministry of our church,
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.800]   the evangelism that we do,
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.520]   the teaching that we participate in,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.480]   that all these things would be empowered by you.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.920]   And I pray, Father God, that for us,
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.520]   the determining factors of what we are participating in
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.000]   would not be whether it's working or not,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.240]   but whether, Father, that you have instructed us to do so.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.720]   For we do believe, God, that you are 100% sovereign,
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.880]   and, God, you will bear your fruit
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.980]   according to your design and your time.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.800]   And so I pray, God, that we would be a church
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.220]   truly moved in confidence,
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.040]   that we're walking this life in faith as we abide in you.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.820]   So, Lord, again, we want to thank you so much,
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:58.780]   and we ask that as each one of us are being strengthened,
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:01.340]   each one of us were being challenged,
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.140]   may you continue to use us, God, for your ministry,
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.720]   that, Lord, for the people in our lives,
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.000]   that, God, you would have us be your mouthpieces,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.760]   and, Lord, that you would have us be your witnesses,
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   and that as we see your glorious light,
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.680]   as we continue to see your amazing power,

[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.140]   Lord, that we would share with the world.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.360]   Lord, again, we want to thank you for this evening.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.120]   We lift this last song up to you in Christ's name, amen.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.560]   - All right, church family,

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.280]   what circumstance we're in, that Jesus is our steady anchor.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.120]   He is our sure foundation, our solid rock.

[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.320]   as you leave, please make sure you just help us.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.280]   Lend a hand in stacking away the chairs, okay?
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   And at this time, this room too,
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.480]   you can use the side exit or use the main exit.
