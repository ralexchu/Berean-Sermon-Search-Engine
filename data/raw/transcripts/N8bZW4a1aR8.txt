[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   is having a Christmas party on December 14th.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   That's gonna be at 5.30 here in the main sanctuary.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   Please make sure you sign up for that.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   And the logistics and team organizing that event
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   has made a special request
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   to please show up dressed festively, okay?
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   So that means bright colors, red, green,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   all that kind of stuff, but come ready for fellowship,
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   games, and a great time together.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   Likewise, the family ministry is gonna be having
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   their separate Christmas party here,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   again, in the main sanctuary,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   but that's gonna be on December 7th.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   Today is the last day to sign up for that,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   so please make sure you register.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   There is gonna be childcare,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   and then also, if you're having a tough time
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   finding the link, et cetera,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   there's gonna be a table outside
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   to make sure we capture everybody.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   For the family members who are doing a performance,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   you are not automatically signed up
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   because you're doing a performance,
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   so please make sure you all register for that, okay?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   The last thing is going to be that our--
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   Oh, for that family Christmas party,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   they are looking for some babysitters,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   so if you are able to help out, lend a hand
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   in taking care of the children during that event,
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   please sign up for that as well.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   The last announcement is that we have,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   for the sake of fellowship and bringing people together,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   our BBA season that's gonna start,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   our basketball season,
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   so the league for the men and the women
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   are gonna be taking place starting from January 5th,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   and so please make sure to sign up for that.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   The requirement is,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   because it's a commitment of sequential weeks,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   the requirement for that is either you are a member
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   or you are in the process
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   of becoming a member at the church.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   So again, look out for the sign-up,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   and there will be a table outside
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   for any questions that you may have.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   All right, at this time, we'll go into time of offering.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   If you do have a physical check,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   there is a drop box right by the entrance as you come in.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Otherwise, you can go ahead and give that online.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   Heavenly Father, we are so grateful to you.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   God, we want to lift up to you our heart of thanks,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   knowing, God, that every single thing we have,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   it comes, Lord God, through your mercy, your love,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   and the grace that you have poured out to us.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   So we thank you this morning and gather with appreciation
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   and also gather with our offering.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Lord, the offering of our heart, our attention,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   also, Lord God, even our finances,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   and I pray, Lord, that the condition of our heart, Lord,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   would always be so trusting in you,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   so thankful and abiding in you, God,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   that all that we're doing is blessed by you.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.

[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   - Let us all rise, and let's spend a few moments
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   just to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   (soft piano music)
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   (soft piano music)

[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   - There is an endless, there is an endless song
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   that goes in my soul.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   I hear the music ring.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   And though the storms may come,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   I am holding on
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   to the rock I came.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   How could I keep, how could I keep
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   from singing your praise?
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.800]   How could I ever say enough?
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   How amazing is your love?
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   How could I keep from shouting your name?
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   I know I am loved by the few,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   and it makes my heart want to sing.

[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   - Good morning once more.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   And if you would please go ahead
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   and take your Bibles and turn to Exodus chapter 15
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   verses one to three.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   Exodus chapter 15.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   And this morning we'll be,
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   as we head into a week of Thanksgiving,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   meditating on a thankful heart of the people of God
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   through many generations,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   designed for us also to have
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   a deep-seated gratitude in our soul.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   So let's take a moment to read this and it says,
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   "Then Moses and the sons of Israel
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   "sang this song to the Lord and said,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   "'I will sing to the Lord for he is highly exalted.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   "'The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   "'The Lord is my strength and song
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   "'and he has become my salvation.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   "'This is my God and I will praise him.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   "'My Father's God and I will extol him.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   "'The Lord is a warrior.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   "'The Lord is his name.'"
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   Let's pray.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for your grace.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Lord, for generations and generations,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   you have continued to reveal yourself
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   in all of your perfection, holiness, and love.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   And I pray, Father God, that we as a people
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   would not only see it with our eyes,
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   but be amazed and be so filled with gratitude
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   that we may know you.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   And what's more, God, that being known by you through Christ,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   Lord, that you provide for us,
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   you take care of us, and you love us to the end.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   We thank you so much, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   Well, as we think about the Thanksgiving season,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   it is tradition to get together as a family,
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   tradition to get together and put on a big feast,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   tradition to, you know, bake the turkey,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   And in our family, we try to make sure that,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   in many ways, we protect this tradition
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   because it is such a sweet time for our worship to God
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   and together as a family.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   And one of the ways we protect it is say,
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   "Hey, no premature Christmas song singing."
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   We try to make sure that we don't just bypass Christmas.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Obviously, we love Christmas carols,
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   we love all the Christmas songs and festivities,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   but we try not to bypass it.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   What's more, my request is let's not call this season
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   like Harvest Festival season because, as you know,
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Harvest Festival, that kind of thing,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   is practiced by almost every religion.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   I mean, you just go back as long as mankind
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   has ever planted a seed,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   they had some kind of annual festivities
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   for Harvest Season,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   praying that it would be bountiful,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   praying that the gods would bless them.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   So Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Korean,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   they have Harvest Festivals, right?
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   So obviously, we're not necessarily celebrating that
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   as a tradition, but here in America, we celebrate
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   what is typically known as, essentially,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   kind of the start of the country.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Looking back a little bit into history,
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   I want to take a moment to go back
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   and kind of appreciate what has happened.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   You guys know that on the Mayflower,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   102 pilgrims came to Plymouth, Massachusetts.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Unfortunately, they were actually headed to Virginia,
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   and they landed way north, okay?
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   Now, for a lot of people, this is a time when
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   they just recall that they had a rough time
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   trying to escape religious persecution.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   They wanted religious freedoms. They came.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   They had the meal with--
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   I have the name of the tribe here--
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   the Wampanoag tribe, okay?
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   And that they helped them.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   And so they had a feast together
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   because they survived, right?
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   But actually, when you look back into history,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   the Christian intent behind their endeavors to come
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   was really, really explicit.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   For example, this is going back now,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   like way back into your youthful education,
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   that in the Mayflower Compact,
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   this was the declaration that,
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   "In the name of God," okay, amen,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   "we, whose names are underwritten,
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   "have undertaken for the glory of God
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   "and the advancement of the Christian faith
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   "the honor of king and country,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   "a voyage to plant the first colony
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   "in the northern parts of Virginia."
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   They were praying and hoping
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   that God would allow for them
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   to have a constitution, a law,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   but a community and society
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   governed by the principles of Scripture.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   Now, in sharing you with this kind of history,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   I want to remind us
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   that these people with great intentions came,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   but they were met with incredible, incredible hardship.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   A lot of the individuals actually died
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   before ever setting foot on land.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   What's more, because they landed
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   in the approaching winter,
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   they didn't have food,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   they didn't have resources,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   and it was said that all but only three families,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   meaning every single family,
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   buried somebody,
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   whether it was their wife, their child.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   By the time the winter was over
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   and they were going into 1621,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   more than half of the entire ship,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   the people on the ship, had died.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Okay, so take a moment to think about that,
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   and what we're thinking about
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   is actually the story is more of monumental loss.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   The story would have been seen as like,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   this is an epic failure.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   When you have over 50% of your whole crew,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   of all the people who wanted to start this colony,
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   pass away before even it's a full year,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   this is an incredible moment
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   of crisis, sorrow, loss, and grief.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   But in the midst of that,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   as you know, a lot of these individuals
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   started to write,
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   "Praise and bless God,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   "because God has provided for us."
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   So William Bradford,
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   the first governor, so to speak,
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   of the colony writes,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   "Praise be to the Lord for his provision."
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   That is Christian faith.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   Now, I'm not here to just kind of magnify
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   or elevate the pilgrims,
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   but to ask this question, we too,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   we should be able to give thanks
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   in every single circumstance, amen?
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   Now, praise God, right now,
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   some of you guys may be going through
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   individual hardships,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   and I don't want to diminish any of that.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   But we live in an incredibly blessed time, right?
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   We live in a time of incredible provision,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   incredible comfort, and luxury,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   to say the least.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   But whether the times are good
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   or whether the times are bad,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   we're supposed to have such a strong foundation
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   in God that we don't need
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   to just simply say nice things
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   or put on like a positive thinking facade,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   but rather that we would feel
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   a deep-seated gratitude.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   And the question is, how do we do that?
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   How do we have such faith that,
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   yes, when times are good,
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   we should say, "Bless the Lord,"
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   because every good and perfect gift
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   comes from the Lord, right?
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   But when circumstances are so treacherous,
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   and when circumstances are so bad,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   how do we give thanks to God?
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   And the reason why I read to you
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   a passage in the book of Exodus
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   because our roots of pilgrimage,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   so to speak,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   we too are just sojourners
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   through this land.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   Our roots of going through uncharted territory
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   and all that kind of stuff
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   goes way back over 3,000 years
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   to the generation of the Exodus.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   And that is a generation
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   where they were both wrought
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   with all kinds of suffering,
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   delivered by God,
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   and praising the Lord in the desert.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   So, how do we have this kind of foundation
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   to have thankfulness in our heart?
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   First, we always have to remember
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   how much we've been forgiven.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   We always have to remember
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   where it is we came from.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   We always have to remember
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   the depths from which God has drawn us,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   the plight from which God has rescued us.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   And this is what the Scripture says,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   that we are so wrought with forgetfulness
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   that God has embedded into both culture,
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   the Word, the ordinances,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   future instruction,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   moments for us to remember.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   And so, I appreciate times like this,
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   seasons like this,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   near the end of the year
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   when we've had so many things happen
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   to start reflecting and say,
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord."
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   Now, the point that I'm going to make to you is this.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   God, I believe He knows us very well.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   He knew that often we'd forget.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   And in the midst of forgetfulness,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   we would forget to be thankful.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   And so, I want to walk with you
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   through certain portions of the book of Exodus
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   to highlight how God has embedded
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   times of remembrance for us
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   to remember this very thing.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   How much has He forgiven?
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   What kind of situation did He save us from?
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   So, first, if you go to Exodus 12,
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   Exodus 12, verse 25,
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   you'll see that the Passover
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   was a massive, massive ordinance of God.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   He has said that this is a holy ordinance.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   This is an ordinance that He wanted His people
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   to observe every single year,
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   every generation,
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   and for the times to come.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   And He said this.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   I'm going to read to you Exodus 12, 25.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   It says, "When you enter the land
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   which the Lord will give you,
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   as He has promised,
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   you shall observe this rite.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   So when your children ask and say to you,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   'What does this rite mean to you?'
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   you shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   to the Lord who passed over
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   when He smote the Egyptians,
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   but spared our homes.'"
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   You know that even to this very day
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   in the Jewish community,
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   if there was a pinnacle,
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   if there was a highlight
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   of the many festivals,
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   the many religious observances that they do,
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   this is at the pinnacle.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   And embedded into that was even more.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Did you know that there was such a feast
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   called the Feast of Love and Bread
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   bound within, attached to the Passover?
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   And in Exodus 12, verse 14, it says,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   "Now this day will be a memorial to you,
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   throughout your generations."
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   You're to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   "Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   but on that first day,
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   you shall remove leaven from your house,
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   for whoever eats anything leavened
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   from the first day until the seventh,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   that person shall be cut off."
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   Meaning it was serious.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   What I'm trying to highlight
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   and help us appreciate
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   is God was trying to make sure
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   that people did not forget.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Now, to us, it's like,
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   sometimes, honestly speaking,
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   we judge that generation.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   How in the world could you forget?
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   Like, so many of your people
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   died under the hands of the Egyptians.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   You saw water turn to blood.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   You saw the sky turn black.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   You heard the screams of people
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   who lost their firstborn.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   And God told you that very day,
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   "Don't wait for the bread to leaven."
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   That was the whole point.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   Why?
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   Because you were supposed to escape.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   How in the world would you forget this?
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   Well, embedded into that even more,
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   I'm just going to pass to the next portion,
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   was another kind of observance
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   called the redemption of the firstborn
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   that the Jewish people
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   still practice to this day.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   In Exodus 13,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   so I'll turn over there,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.800]   Exodus 13, verse 2,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   God said, "Sanctify to me every firstborn,
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   the first offspring of every womb
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   among the sons of Israel,
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   both of man and beast.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   It belongs to me."
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   Moses said to the people,
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   "Remember this day
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   in which you went out from Egypt,
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   from the house of slavery,
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   for by a powerful hand
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   the Lord brought you out from this place."
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   What is he referring to?
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   A lot of times the Jewish people,
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   and we too forget,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   yes, they were being delivered.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   Yes, they were being rescued
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   from the hands of the Egyptians.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   But the greatest thing they were rescued from
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   was the wrath of God
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   among the people, everybody.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   The firstborn of every single house
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   died unless there was the blood
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   of the sacrificial lamb on their home.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Right?
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   Finally,
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   within even this whole context
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   of God preparing
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   these people to move,
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   they haven't left yet.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   They're just getting prepared.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   God wanted people to have
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   phleracteries,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   man, that's a hard word to say.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   Teflon.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   In Exodus 13, verse 16,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   God said,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   "So it shall serve as a sign on your hand
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   and as phleracteries on your forehead,
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   for with a powerful hand
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   the Lord brought us out of Egypt."
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   If you just look it up on Google,
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   you'll see even to this day
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   there are people
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   with small decorative boxes
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   bound around their head,
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   and what they have
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   is little written scriptures in there
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   to help them remember.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   What is my point?
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   Well,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   sometimes it is flabbergasting
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   and a little bit, like, unbelievable,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   but literally
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   within this one first generation,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   you know they will forget.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   It's convicting, isn't it?
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   At the moment they step out
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   of seeing God's incredible power,
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   and with their eyes they see the desert,
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   they see the chariots behind them,
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   they see that they don't have water,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   they see that they don't have food.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Immediately they will forget.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   This is like us too,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   brothers and sisters.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   We have experienced
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   incredible mercies by God.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   We have experienced lavishing love
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   that we don't deserve.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   We've received forgiveness
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   that sometimes it just baffles our mind,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   like, it's too easy.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   The sins that we've committed,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   how could you forgive us so freely?
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   And yet we turn around,
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   something happens,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   and all of a sudden we forget.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   God knew.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   And that's why in Ephesians chapter 2,
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   turn there,
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11,
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   Scripture is calling to us,
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   you know through the gospel
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   that you were once dead.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   You walked among the sons of disobedience,
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   but it was God's mercy.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   So what you need to do is remember.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   In Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11,
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   it says, "Therefore remember
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   that formerly you,
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   the Gentiles in the flesh,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   who were called uncircumcision
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   by the so-called circumcision,
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   which is performed in the flesh
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   by human hands,
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   remember that you were at that time
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   separate from Christ,
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   excluded from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   strangers to the covenant of promise,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   having no hope without God in the world.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   But now in Christ Jesus,
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   you who were formerly so far off
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   have been brought near by the blood of Christ."
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   Amen.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   This is time for us to just remember.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   For us, even you know,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   just thinking how many years are we removed.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Thinking that yes,
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   we weren't part of the commonwealth of Israel.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   We were strangers, we were far off,
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   and yet brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   Essentially, what is a killer of thanksgiving
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   in our hearts is forgetfulness.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Essentially, what is a killer of thankfulness
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   in our hearts are getting so myopic to,
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   "Oh my goodness, I have to do this,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   and I have to do that,
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   and there are so many things going on."
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   So preoccupied and consumed
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   with whatever it is the agenda of your day
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   that we're forgetting to thank the Lord.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   But remember, there is this principle
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   that Jesus said.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   Pastor Peter has been preaching
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   through the book of Luke,
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   and in Luke chapter 7,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   there is a woman who comes to anoint Jesus,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   and she is, according to the world,
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   a defiled woman.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   She is, according to the world,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   an unworthy woman.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   She shouldn't be even stepping foot
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   in the house of the men who have gathered.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   But she comes,
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   and she starts to pour out the oil,
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   and Pastor Peter reminded us,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   "Do you have any idea how much
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   that oil would have been worth to her?"
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   And she starts crying and weeping
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   and going down to his feet
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   to kiss his feet.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   And self-righteously, the men in the room
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   look up and say,
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   "Jesus is no prophet.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   "If he was a prophet,
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   "he would know how dirty this woman is."
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   And in the midst of that,
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Jesus asks Simon a question.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   He says, "I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   "Who would be more thankful,
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   "one who's been forgiven a hundred
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.800]   "or one who's been forgiven thousands?"
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   Easy answer, of course,
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   the one who's been forgiven more.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   And Jesus Christ gave us this principle,
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   "Much forgiven, you will love much."
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   So for us, the call is just simple.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   Do we feel the gravity and the weight?
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Do we feel the extent to which
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   when we think about how far
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   Christ came down to this earth
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.800]   to walk this dirty and perverse land,
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   do we understand the depth
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   to which God has reached to save?
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   Point two is simply this.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   God must truly be your all in all.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   In order to have this thankful,
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   rejoicing sentiment in our heart
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   that's not contingent upon the stuff we have,
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   the people we have,
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   and the kind of life we live,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   but rather it transcends all that
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   to be much like the pilgrims,
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   to be much like the generation.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.800]   God must truly be your all in all.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.800]   In Exodus 15, I'm going to read to us
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   the passage that I read earlier,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   and it says,
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   "When Moses and the sons of Israel
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   "sang this song to the Lord."
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   So chapter 15 is immediately after the rescue.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   The incredible drama of running
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   and then hitting the sea,
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   and the chariots coming,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   and the sea splitting,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   this is immediately after
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   that great, great deliverance by God.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   And then so, singing to the Lord,
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   it says, "I will sing to the Lord,
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   "for he is highly exalted,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   "the horse and his rider he has hurled into the sea.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   "Lord is my strength and song,
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   "and he has become my salvation.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   "This is my God."
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   Pause there.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   If you take a moment to think
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   about the beautiful verses within Scripture,
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   we have everything describing
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   so many things that God gives to us,
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   and the Scripture actually says,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   what are we going to give in return
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.800]   to all the benefits that God gave to us?
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   I want you to think of sometimes the idiom,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   or maybe a cliche kind of phrase
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   that is thrown around during Thanksgiving,
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   which is, "Man, we really need to learn
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   "to count our blessings."
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   Especially, let's say,
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   if you're kind of in a humbug attitude,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   and you're going across both Thanksgiving
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   and Christmas season,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   and you're just like,
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   "Oh, there's all this stuff I need to do."
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   A lot of times, the idiom is just simply,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   "You need to count your blessings."
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Well, I will say, in one sense,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   it's absolutely right.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   We, as Christians, should be able to list off,
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   "This is how my God has been faithful.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   "This is everything that I have,
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   "according to his grace and mercy."
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Amen?
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   But you know that it's more than that, right?
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   You know that it's so much more than that,
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   because if you are talking to this generation,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   did the nation of Israel,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   did the God's people,
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   did they come out of that completely unscathed?
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.800]   Did they not lose people?
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   Did they not suffer?
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   Did they not, yes, they got delivered,
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   but did they not have nothing with them
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   but just what they could carry?
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   Were they not looking into a barren desert?
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.800]   It's hard to just be like,
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   "Hey, count your blessings," right?
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   So my point is,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   we have to do so much more than that.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   To say that God is my salvation
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   is to know that I have God as my everything,
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.800]   that I have God as my warrior,
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   I have God as my protection,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.800]   I have God as my provision.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.800]   And so this beautiful poem,
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   a song that Moses wrote,
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   it continues in verse 11.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.800]   So chapter 15, verse 11.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.800]   "Who is like you among the gods, O Lord?
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   "Who is like you, majestic in holiness,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   "awesome in praises, working wonders?
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   "You stretched out your right hand.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   "The earth swallowed them,
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   "and in your loving kindness,
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   "you have led the people whom you have redeemed.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   "In your strength, you have guided them
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   "to your holy habitation."
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   Amen.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.800]   The thankfulness that we have
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   moves us to see God
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   as truly the source of everything.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   But now I want us to think,
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   because how many times for you as a Christian,
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   have you heard that, right?
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   That you shouldn't love the gift,
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   but you should be in deep, deep love
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   with the gift giver, right?
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   That you shouldn't just want the temporary
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.800]   and the fleeting things of life,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   but that you should have God Almighty,
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   who is your sufficient supply of everything.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   How many times as a Christian have you heard that, right?
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   To not just see God as a cosmic vending machine,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   but rather to see Him as the one you love.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   And maybe even more appropriate to our season now,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   nobody loves Jeff Bezos.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.800]   For the people who don't know who he is,
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   he is the founder of Amazon.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   Nobody loves Amazon.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   They just love the stuff that comes next day delivery.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   You get the analogies.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   You've heard the preaching before,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   that for us to just simply love the stuff
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   and not the person who's giving,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   that doesn't actually equate to the kind of faith
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   and the kind of sentiment of thanksgiving we should have.
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   But what I'm going to say now is,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   God Himself will put to the test
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   the thanksgiving and the faith that we exercise.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   Okay?
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   We know that God is supposed to be everything,
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   but God will cause us to be tested in this.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   The people of this generation,
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   immediately after, are walking.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   And they start grumbling, saying,
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   "Where is the food? I'm so hungry."
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   And they grumble in such a way where it's absolutely offensive,
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.800]   and they start saying stuff like, "I wish we were back in Egypt.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   At least there we had stuff." Right?
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   I mean, they were enslaved.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   They had people of their own kinsmen
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   be just buried underneath the buildings.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   And yet they say stuff like this.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   I want you to take a moment now to turn
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   to the very next chapter, chapter 16,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   and see how quickly people turn to complaining.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.800]   Okay?
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   In Exodus 16, I'm going to read for us
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   a little longer segment from verse 1 through 7.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.800]   Exodus 16, 1 through 7.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   It says, "They set out from Elim,
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   and all the congregation of the sons of Israel
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   came to the wilderness of Sin,"
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.800]   which is between Elim and Sinai.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   "On the fifteenth day of the second month,
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   after their departure from the land of Egypt."
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   Okay?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.800]   So this is only a month and a half.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   Fifteenth day of the second month.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   Okay?
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   "The whole congregation of the sons of Israel
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   The sons of Israel said to them,
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   'With that we have died by the Lord's hand
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   in the land of Egypt.'"
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   What?
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   What did they just say?
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   That God himself would have just killed us there.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   "When we sat by the pots of meat,
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   when we ate bread to the full,
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   for you have brought us out into this wilderness
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.800]   to kill this whole assembly with hunger?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800]   And the Lord said to Moses,
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   'Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.'"
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   Pause there.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   I mean, it wouldn't have been hard for us to be like,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   "And I will rain fire," right?
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   Instead of bread.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   And it says, "And the people shall go out
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   and gather a day's portion every day
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   that I may test them."
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   Huh.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   Did you ever think about that?
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   I thought the giving of the manna
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.800]   was just simply the blessing.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   It was God conceding to their grumbling.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   Are you sad that you're here?
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   Are you sad you don't have food?
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   Well, then here, at least here's the bread, right?
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800]   No.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   He says, "I'm going to test them
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   whether or not they will walk by my instruction."
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   And you know exactly what happens.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   It says, "On the sixth day,
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   when they prepare what they bring in,
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   it will be twice as much as they gather daily.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.800]   So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.800]   'At evening you will know that the Lord
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   has brought you out of the land of Egypt,
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   for here is your grumbling against the Lord.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   And what are we that you grumble against us?'"
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   So in looking at that passage,
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   I know I'm kind of making this point
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   that God is using the provision of the manna
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.800]   as a means to test the people.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   What do I mean by that?
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   You know that God gave this stipulation.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   "I'm going to give you this sweet bread."
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   Scripture says that it was like melting honey.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   And when the sun came out,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   it actually melted like honey, right?
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   So essentially, you just have like sweet,
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   I just imagine, you know, not 85 or anything like that,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   but it's something sweet, right?
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Okay.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   But God's rule was you are only allowed
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   to go out every day and pick up
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   what is good for your family that day.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   And you know what's crazy?
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   As God said, this bread is so miraculous
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   that for those of you guys who can't pick up enough,
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   you go to your house, you'll have enough.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   Those of you guys who are a little greedy
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   and you pick up too much,
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   you go to your house, it's going to disappear.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   Right?
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   That's what he said.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   It's magical bread.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   And then on the sixth day,
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   there will be a double portion
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   that rains down from heaven.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   It's going to be like dew on the ground.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   And guess what?
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   It's going to last two days.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   Why?
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   Because on the seventh day,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   you're supposed to observe the Sabbath.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   And remember who?
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   God, the creator.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   You're a deliverer.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   And you know exactly what they did.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   A lot of people started hoarding too much.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   And then so I started to think, like,
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   dude, the killer of Thanksgiving in our heart
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   is grumbling.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   Grumbling that we don't have food.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   But the thing is,
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   let me just take a moment to meditate together.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   You and I are way mature,
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   too mature to just grumble about food.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800]   Right?
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   I mean, how many of us would get sweet, sweet bread
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800]   and be like, "Oh, bread."
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   Right?
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   We'd all just eat it.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   I know I would.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   You guys know I love sweets.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   Right?
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Well, one, they grumbled
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   because they didn't have meat.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   Okay?
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   A lot of us,
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   maybe we just can't eat the same food
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   over and over again
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   for months and months and months.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   You know, they actually ate this for 40 years.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.800]   They ate this for the whole generation.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   Okay?
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   So then you kind of ask,
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   what were they actually grumbling about?
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   I started to think and meditate.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   I got to be honest with you,
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   in my kind of self-righteous heart,
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   I was getting frustrated with these people.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   How can you be grumbling?
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   Right?
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   You straight up don't even need to work.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   You don't even need, like,
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   imagine God said,
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   "I want you to plant this magical seed,"
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   so that they had to go and till the ground.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   That would be so hard.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   But they were always moving.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   There would be more complaining.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   So God just gave them stuff
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   they can pick up along the way.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   And I'm sitting here self-righteously thinking,
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   "What's wrong with you people?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   How can you complain to God?"
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   Right?
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   And then you realize,
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   "Oh, wait a minute.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.800]   I probably would have complained too."
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   Because if I have to pick up stuff
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   every single day,
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   my first thought would have been like,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.800]   the, you know, efficiency part of me.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800]   I'd be like,
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   "We could just gather everything
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   and we don't have to do this every morning."
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   And that's probably what the people did.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   And that, you know,
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   you always have that person who's like,
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.800]   "Moses, Moses, I got an idea."
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   You know?
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Maybe that would have been me.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   What's more,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   once you guys are parents in here,
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   imagine giving this stuff to your children
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   every single day.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   Imagine you having to carry this
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800]   and all that stuff,
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   and you have to carry it to your family members,
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   and your family members are complaining,
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   you're dealing with this,
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.800]   and like, "Oh, how come we can't have that stuff?"
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   My point is,
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   you take a moment to imagine,
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.800]   you take a moment to drop that into their shoes,
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   we're not very different.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   If I was walking around aimlessly,
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.800]   it's hard to be thankful when you're thirsty.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.800]   It's hard to be thankful
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   when you start feeling like
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   there's not going to be any change in your life.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   For those of you guys who are struggling with
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800]   feeling like you're at,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   "Dude, this job is kind of dead end."
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   Those of you guys who kind of feel like,
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   "I don't have the best people around me."
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Those people who kind of feel like,
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   "You know what, it would be so much better if..."
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   And you have all these fantasies of,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   "If only certain things would happen,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   "this would be so much easier, so much better."
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.800]   We're not so different.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   And so what am I saying?
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   Well, quick question to you is,
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800]   is there any grumbling,
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   complaining in your heart about your lot in life?
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   God has been testing you.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   God has been testing these people just with bread.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   Would you obey and follow?
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   Would you be content with the provision that I give you?
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   There is a reason why God was teaching them
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   that his provision for them
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   was going to be sufficient for that day,
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]   and then he's teaching us to pray,
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   "Give me my daily bread."
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   Yes?
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   But are we getting so caught up,
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.800]   getting so discontent,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   that we would raise a grumbling heart to the Lord?
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.800]   What kills a thankful heart is grumbling.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.800]   My final point attached to this
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   is that a primary description
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   of the depraved people are a thankless people.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.800]   Now, that sounds so not in line with what I was saying.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   Like, how do you have a thankful heart?
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   It's like, well,
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   a primary thing of the unbelievers, essentially,
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.800]   is thanklessness.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   And here's the point that I'm making, okay?
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   Tying this together,
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   if we have eyes of the flesh,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   we're going to be complaining all the time.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   Why? It makes sense.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   There's so much, so much
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   in this world that is broken.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   There's so many things that are, like,
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.800]   not supposed to be, okay?
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   There's so much violence, wickedness,
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   selfishness, evil, perversion.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.800]   We completely, completely live in a depraved world.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.800]   If you have eyes of flesh,
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   when you complain, it makes sense.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   When you grumble, it's logical, right?
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.800]   I want you to take a moment to turn to Romans
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   and walk down a passage with me.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   What I'm going to say is this.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   There is a sensibility
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   to the unsaved, to the depraved.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.800]   Now, that's going to sound weird,
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   but take a moment to think with me.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.800]   Romans 1, verse 21.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.800]   "For even though they knew God,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   they did not honor Him as God or give thanks,
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   but they became futile in their speculations,
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   and their foolish heart was darkened."
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   This is a primary description
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   of the unbeliever,
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.800]   of the hardened of heart,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:21.800]   that he sees God but can't give thanks to Him.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Is that just all nonsensical, complete blindness?
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.800]   Yes, but what I'm saying also is
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.800]   that's a practical decision.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   Look at verse 25, same chapter.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   Romans 1, 25.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   "For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   and worshiped and served the creature
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.800]   rather than the Creator who is blessed forever."
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   Why?
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   Because they can see it.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   They can tangibly manipulate it.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.800]   They can carry their gods with them.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800]   They can control it.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   There's a rationale to this,
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   and it's almost practical.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   Romans 1, verse 28.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   "And just as they did not see fit
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   to acknowledge God any longer,
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   God gave them over to a depraved mind
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.800]   to do the things which are not proper."
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.800]   There is this progression within Romans 1.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.800]   Essentially, they see God,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   and they kind of see Him,
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.800]   but they really don't, right?
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.800]   And it's not like the other gods
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.800]   where they can just go however they want.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.800]   You understand that the people back in their time
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.800]   couldn't just approach God however they wanted.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   It was so much more convenient
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   to have an idol in your house, right?
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800]   And what's more,
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   they continued down this path
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800]   of seeing and not really seeing,
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.800]   seeing and not really seeing.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   Who is Romans 1 primarily talking about, you think?
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   It's the people of the past.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   It's the people who had the law.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800]   In verse 32, it says,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.800]   "Although they knew the ordinance of God,
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   but those who practiced such vile wickedness
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   and they were worthy of death,
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   they not only did the same,
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   but also gave hearty approval
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   to those who practiced it."
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   Basically, it was the wilderness generation
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   who were given the law.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.800]   And why do I say it this way?
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   It's because the challenge for us
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   is to have eyes not of practicality,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   not have eyes of efficiency,
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   not have eyes of productivity,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   not have eyes that are fleshly
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   in terms of what I can see,
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   what I can touch and control,
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:30.800]   which is so the bent of every non-Christian.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.800]   In order for us to have a thankful heart,
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   we have to have eyes of faith, amen?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   We have to see beyond what our eyes see
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   and have trust.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   The great call and exhortation for the Christian
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.800]   is to walk not by sight, but by trust.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   By trust.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   There's a passage in Philippians 2, verse 13-15,
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   I want to read to you.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800]   And it says,
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.800]   "For it is God who is at work in you."
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800]   Do you believe that?
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.800]   "For those of you who are very discontent
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.800]   "with where you are now,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.800]   "and so your heart would complain
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.800]   "about just simply your own maturity,
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   "do you believe and trust that God is working in you?"
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.800]   It says in Scripture here
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   that He is working in you both to will
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   and to work for His good pleasure.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   "So do all things without grumbling or disputing
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   "so that you will prove yourselves
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   "to be blameless and innocent children of God,
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   "above reproach in the midst of a crooked
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.800]   "and perverse generation,
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   "among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   Brothers and sisters, it is God's will for us
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800]   that we would be absolutely thankful.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.800]   In order to do this,
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   I reminded us, remember.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   Remember deeply how much we have been forgiven,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   how desperate we were.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   Remember that we have to see God
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   not simply as a source of things,
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   but rather that He himself is our all in all.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.800]   And what's more, in every circumstance and situation,
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.800]   we look up, not with pragmatic eyes,
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.800]   not with our own logical eyes,
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   not with our own senses,
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   but with absolute trust.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.800]   Heavenly Father,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   we do want to take time to thank you.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.800]   Our hearts are filled with gratitude.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.800]   God, we do count our blessings.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.800]   Lord, we take a moment to look at our lives
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.800]   in the grace that you've poured out.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800]   We take a look at our whole church,
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.800]   the people you have provided, the provisions,
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.800]   the teaching, the love, the grace,
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.800]   the fellowship, and more.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.800]   But ultimately, God, we know
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   there is absolutely, God, no one like you,
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.800]   and to have you is everything.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.800]   We know, Father God, we could lose the world.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   People can take it away.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   We could even lose our health.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   We could lose our own senses.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   And yet, to have you means we have it all.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   And I pray then, Father God,
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   from knowing this and from having faith
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   and trusting in you,
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   you would grant to us an overwhelming joy
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   and peace in our lives.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800]   We thank you this in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.800]   Let us all rise for the closing praise.

[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   Heavenly Father, as a congregation gathered,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   we lift to you our praises and our thanksgiving.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   God, we are so grateful for every single thing
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   you have granted to us in life.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   We are so grateful, Father God,
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.800]   for all the common mercies, daily grace,

[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800]   We want to say to you, Lord, I wish, Father God,
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   that our faith will continue to grow in such a way
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800]   where we can say, God, to the world,

[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.800]   Take away the friends, take away the luxuries,

[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   And I pray, Father God, that you would continue then
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.800]   to work in us in such a way that we are drawn so close,
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   Father God, that we have all the hope

[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   They called him Jesus.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.800]   He came to earth.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:29.800]   He looked for pain.

[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
