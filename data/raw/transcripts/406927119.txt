[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.280]   As we celebrate the Lord's resurrection,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.920]   we're going to spend some time in John chapter 11,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.320]   and we're actually going to work backwards
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.000]   because what happens in John chapter 11
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.920]   is really a setup for the resurrection
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.640]   that will take place.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.080]   And so I'm not going to read a text,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.880]   but I'm going to pray for us,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.360]   and then we'll jump right into the sermon this morning.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.360]   So let's pray.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.680]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.840]   Help us to understand the significance of this day
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.680]   and be impacted by it,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.160]   that our confession as you being our Lord and Savior
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.440]   will be more than mere words.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.800]   I pray for radical changes in our hearts, Lord God,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.160]   that we may reevaluate every part of who we are,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.120]   what we think, what we do,
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.160]   our goals, our hopes, our dreams, Lord God.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.000]   May all be satisfied in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.840]   May your word be highlighted.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.320]   May your very breath, Lord God,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.280]   be experienced by the people who hear it.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.600]   You know, if you did a survey online
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.200]   to see what's the greatest fear of mankind,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680]   you'll probably get many different lists.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.240]   On some lists, they say that the greatest fear
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.080]   that most people will say is public speaking,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.440]   which is kind of weird,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   but, you know, like people fear judgment
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.360]   when they speak in public.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.000]   Some people fear -- their greatest fear is rejection,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.920]   fear of heights, fear of failing.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.600]   Now, fear of death is always in the top 10,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.760]   but for whatever the reason, it was never number one.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.080]   And I think the reason why it's not number one
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560]   in most people's list is because for most people
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.720]   on a day-to-day basis, death is not real
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800]   until we actually pass away
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   or we experience the death in some way, in an intimate way.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.960]   But I think most of us will agree
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.320]   that death is the greatest fear of all mankind.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.000]   I mean, part of the reason why we're having service online
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.080]   is because of this fear of death.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.480]   The world did not get shut down
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.920]   because of fear of public speaking.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   The world didn't shut down because of fear of rejection.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200]   The world shut down because of this pandemic,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.400]   and it's not just a pandemic.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.920]   If there was a cure to this pandemic, people --
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   We didn't shut down. The world did not shut down
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   because of fear of getting ill.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.320]   The world shut down because there is a possibility
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.360]   that this illness can lead to death.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.680]   But according to statistics, at least in the United States,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.080]   the fatality rate is somewhere between 1% to 1.2%.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000]   At least that's what it is now.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.640]   And they've had enough samples
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880]   to say that that's probably accurate.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.640]   It may even go down further as they do more testing.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.040]   But that's 1% fatality of people
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   who actually get the disease.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.480]   So if you take that totality of everybody
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.840]   who's in the United States, it's not high.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.640]   But it's enough that this fear of death is strong enough
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.760]   that whatever will come out of this pandemic
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.840]   and this shutdown,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   it was worth shutting down to save lives.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   Now, this Resurrection Sunday is all about death.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.760]   It's about the hope that Christ brings.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.960]   The greatest fear of mankind
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.560]   turns into the greatest hope of mankind
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.360]   because of what Christ has done today.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.920]   In Hebrews 2, 14 to 15, it says,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.120]   "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   "he," meaning Christ,
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.560]   "himself likewise also partook of the same,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.240]   "that through death he might render powerless
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.440]   "him who had the power of death," that is the devil,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.960]   "and might free those who through fear of death
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   "were subject to slavery all their lives."
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.360]   And I think this verse is relevant in any generation
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.560]   at any time, even when we're living in peace.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.160]   But especially now,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.520]   as the whole world is in lockdown temporarily,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.840]   to try our best to avoid this death.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.040]   This Resurrection Sunday is really about that,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.720]   about turning this dark pandemic,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.520]   this possibility of death, ultimately to glory.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.640]   Well, I'm going to be working backwards today
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.040]   because we looked at his crucifixion, his trial on Friday.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.320]   We talked about Palm Sunday,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080]   but we're actually going to walk backwards
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   into John chapter 11,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.080]   where Jesus foreshadows what he was going to do
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   in John chapter 11.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.840]   And it is one of his I am statements,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.600]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.520]   So as we work through chapter 11,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.560]   I want you to pay attention to the various responses
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.440]   that people are giving to this resurrection
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.080]   or this bringing back to life, Lazarus.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.160]   And so what I want to do is starting from chapter one,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.760]   there are five specific scenes.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.520]   So if you were making a movie or doing a play,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.800]   there's five specific scenes
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.000]   that highlight certain events that are taking place.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.200]   And through it all,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.040]   what I'd like you to pay attention to
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.080]   is the different responses that people are giving
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.200]   to Jesus's resurrection.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.520]   So scene one.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.920]   So if you have the children's outline,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.200]   that outline is basically the sermon outline.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.040]   So if you parents want to follow that as well,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.440]   if that's going to help you.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.240]   Scene one, starting from verse one through six.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.360]   So what I encourage you to do is,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.920]   the verses will be displayed on the screen,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.600]   at least parts of it.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.280]   But if you have your Bible, open it up,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.680]   and I encourage you to just keep it there
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   because we're going to be working through
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.640]   the whole text, chapter 11 today.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.120]   Scene one, verse one through six,
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.080]   the sickness that leads to glory.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.200]   And this is the setup behind what is going to take place.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.640]   Verse 11, I'm not going to read everything,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.760]   but I want you to pay attention.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.200]   Now, a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   the village of Mary and the sister Martha.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.720]   It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.540]   and wiped his feet with her hair,
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.880]   whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.740]   So first thing I want us to remember or to highlight
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.480]   is that Lazarus was not just any man.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   Lazarus was a man who was the younger brother,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.340]   most likely of Mary and Martha.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.260]   Mary Martha, as you know, is a very prominent figure
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.320]   in Jesus's ministry.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.040]   Their name is mentioned many times
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.060]   throughout the scriptures.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.680]   And it highlights Mary was the one who anointed Jesus.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   When everybody else was paying attention to other things,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.800]   either Mary knew what was going to happen
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280]   or Mary's love for Christ was so overwhelming
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.800]   that she was willing to break a year's worth
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.360]   of an average pay to prepare Jesus for his burial.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.720]   She's the one who got on her knees
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.920]   and humbled herself and washed Jesus's feet.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.900]   And it's highlighted that this relationship
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.020]   that Jesus has with this family was special.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.820]   It was not just any family.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.140]   And he goes on to say,
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.140]   so the sister sent word to him saying,
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.920]   "Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick."
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   Now, Jesus healed complete strangers in crowds.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.820]   Sometimes he was very gracious to people
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.020]   who were even hostile to him.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.220]   Remember the lepers who he healed
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.100]   and nine of them just celebrated
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.380]   and just took off, forgot about him,
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.580]   and only one returned?
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.020]   So it's highlighting if God was gracious
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.180]   to just strangers or multitudes,
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.260]   how much more would he be to whom he loved?
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.180]   And all of this is a setup for what's about to happen.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.280]   Verse four, when Jesus heard this, he said,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.940]   "This sickness is not to end in death,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.060]   "but the glory of God,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.980]   "so that the Son of Man may be glorified by it."
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.580]   And again, all of this is a setup
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.980]   for what he's about to do in chapter 11,
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.940]   to raise Lazarus at the end of this chapter.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.900]   He said, "All of this is God-ordained.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.880]   "This darkness is going to turn to glory.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.240]   "You guys are worried and you call the right person.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.140]   "I am gonna go, but it's not gonna end in sadness.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.380]   "It's gonna end in glory."
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.380]   So you would expect that Lazarus, whom he loved,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.080]   whose sister Mary was the one who anointed his feet,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.740]   Martha is constantly busy serving the disciples.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.320]   And he says, "Don't worry, he's not gonna die.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.400]   "It's gonna end in his glory."
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   That he would pack up his bag, whatever he was doing,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.200]   he would pack up his bag and get his disciples to go.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   But instead, in verse six, it says,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.020]   "So when he heard that he was sick,
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.120]   "he stayed then two days longer in the place where he was."
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   Which is a very strange way to end that.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.680]   Because every part of what he says in this scene,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.600]   you would expect him to pack up and hurry
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   and get out of there to make sure
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.880]   that he gets there in time.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.120]   Instead, he takes his sweet time.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.960]   He takes two days longer.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.320]   Now, why did he do that?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.880]   Because part of the display of God's glory
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.580]   is going to be him allowing them to experience the death.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.880]   He wasn't going to preserve him from this death.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.080]   He was going to allow them to experience his death
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.320]   and the grief that comes along with this death,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.760]   with the weeping and sadness that comes along with that.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.480]   And he stayed two days longer
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.320]   to allow them to experience this.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.800]   And he wanted to make sure
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.720]   that there was going to be darkness
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.380]   before he turns on the light.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.440]   Now, this is foreshadowing of what was going to happen
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.120]   to Israel and to mankind itself.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   When Jesus was crucified, he didn't just die in obscurity.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.300]   He was crucified by the hands
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.780]   of the leaders of Israel.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.840]   He was crucified by the hands of the people
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.640]   that he came and he wept for.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.840]   And so the reason why God allowed that
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.920]   is he allowed the room to get as dark as possible
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.520]   before he turns on the light.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.520]   If you have something to display,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.880]   you want to make sure that display is seen clearly.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.580]   And in order to do that, you have to turn down the light.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.300]   Jesus was allowing mankind to experience
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.220]   their lowest moment of history.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.880]   The darkest moment of mankind's history
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.520]   was the death of Jesus Christ
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.240]   because he was the one who was preparing.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   He was the one who loved us.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.640]   He was the one who took our sorrows and bore it on himself.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.880]   And it was he, the author of life, that we crucify.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.960]   The darkest moment of mankind's history
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.240]   is not the Holocaust.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.840]   Slavery, as ugly as it is, and it was,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.240]   was not the darkest part of human history.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.500]   It was a day that mankind chose to crucify,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.800]   the only one that could save us from our sins.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.300]   Jesus allows this to take place.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.060]   And so finally, after two days, we get to scene two.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.660]   And scene two, you know, if this wasn't a sermon,
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.020]   there's so much comical material in this section.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.160]   The cluelessness of the disciples, verses seven through 16.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.020]   Then after he said to the disciples,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.820]   let us go to Judea again,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.940]   the disciples said to him,
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.900]   Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.460]   and are you going there again?
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.500]   In other words, you know what's gonna happen
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.340]   when you go there.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.660]   All of our enemies who want to kill you,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.140]   all the leaders of Israel, their power,
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.620]   the soldiers, the temple soldiers,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.360]   they're all in that area.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.740]   Which, you know, the reason why this is so comical
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.620]   is because Jesus has been steadily moving down
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.660]   from Galilee to Jerusalem.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.540]   He made it very clear that his final destination
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.260]   was never going to be Bethany.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.460]   Bethany was just a place that he's passing through.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.340]   He said, not only is he gonna go to Bethany,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.700]   he's gonna go to the heart,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.060]   he's going to the heart of danger, into Jerusalem.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.540]   And he's been telling them this,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.980]   they've been on this journey for months.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.060]   When finally Jesus says,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.660]   with Bethany about two miles away from Jerusalem,
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.020]   it's almost like they weren't there.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.780]   It's almost like Jesus said all of these things
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.780]   and they didn't hear him at all.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.720]   And Jesus said, are there not 12 hours in the day?
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.400]   What does he mean by that?
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.620]   Well, if you read on, it says,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.660]   if anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.620]   because he sees the light of this world.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.200]   But if anyone walks in the night,
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.660]   he stumbles because the light is not in him.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.500]   Now, what Jesus meant by that was,
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.820]   again, the Jews typically counted a day
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.380]   in 12-hour increments.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.980]   So you had the day and then you had the 12-hour nights.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.900]   Unlike when we say a day, we say 24 hours.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.580]   What Jesus meant was, if you walk in the light,
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.100]   if you are living righteously,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.180]   and as long as you are with me,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.380]   in other words, Jesus is saying you are safe.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.400]   Now, Jesus was not saying
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.880]   that you're not gonna experience pain
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.700]   'cause Jesus told him, if you're gonna come after me,
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.700]   you have to pick up your cross.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.180]   He already told them that he was going to be crucified.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.220]   He was going to be beaten.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.100]   So what he means by that is that you will not stumble,
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.100]   means that safety means that you're gonna be in God's hand.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.460]   You're gonna be in God's purpose.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.320]   In other words, do not be afraid.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.420]   You're with the light.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.380]   This he said in verse 11,
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.580]   after that, he said to them,
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.780]   our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.940]   but I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.100]   The disciples then said to him,
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.380]   Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.740]   Again, they don't get it.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.580]   These guys are dead.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.740]   Of course, that's not what he meant.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.540]   And he says, now Jesus had spoken of his death,
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.140]   but they thought that he was speaking of literal sleep.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.980]   So when Jesus said he has fallen asleep,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.100]   was that, well, he's just gonna wake up then.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.700]   Why do we need to go to Bethany?
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.060]   You could just see the frustration in verse 14
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.860]   when Jesus says,
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.540]   so Jesus then said to them plainly,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.940]   Lazarus is dead.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.060]   I don't know about you, but I don't know why.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.780]   That seems very comical to me.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.180]   He's fallen asleep, he's sleeping.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.460]   Why do we need to go to Bethany?
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.020]   He's dead, I meant he's dead.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.620]   He's dead.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.820]   And he had to speak to them very plainly
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.340]   because Jesus is saying one thing
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.620]   and they're constantly hearing something else.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.940]   Why was that?
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.980]   Why were they having such a hard time
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.240]   understanding what we read so plainly?
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:55.500]   In fact, if you read the Gospel of Mark,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.320]   Mark makes it a point.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.100]   Mark makes it a point that Jesus made this very clear
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.660]   what he was doing.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.420]   Mark 8, 31 to 32.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.580]   And Jesus, he began to teach them
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.500]   that the Son of Man, Son of Man meaning Jesus,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.300]   must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.180]   and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.860]   And after three days, rise again,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.580]   and he was stating the matter plainly.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.420]   Now, Mark says that on purpose.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.100]   It wasn't miscommunication.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.820]   Maybe Jesus didn't use the right words
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.100]   or maybe there was a different context
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.980]   that we don't understand.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.940]   He said, no, Jesus made this very plainly.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.060]   And Peter seems to have understood,
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.500]   at least for the moment.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.860]   And it says, and Peter took him aside
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.620]   and began to rebuke him.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.580]   Now, think about the arrogance of that.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.460]   On one sense, humanly speaking,
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.100]   Peter loved Jesus and there's no question about that.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:59.260]   But it was also filled with his own arrogance and pride.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260]   And you see that as they get closer to the cross,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.620]   Peter's like, I'm gonna protect you.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.740]   All of these guys, all of these guys may fail you,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.580]   but not me.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.380]   Obviously, Peter actually fails miserably.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.700]   He's the one who denies Jesus to his face three times.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.340]   But what Jesus said just didn't make sense.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.820]   He's the Messiah.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.780]   I mean, he walks on water.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.060]   He calms a storm that would have easily wiped out
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.580]   generational fishermen.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.460]   Why would you be killed?
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.940]   Who's going to kill you?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.380]   Who's gonna beat you?
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.900]   He couldn't understand.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.140]   But if this is gonna happen, don't worry, you got me.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.980]   You got me.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.140]   Clearly, he didn't understand.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.020]   And Mark makes it a point to point that out.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.980]   Mark chapter nine, 31 through 34.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.340]   Again, he says, "For he was teaching his disciples
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.540]   "and telling them, the Son of Man is to be delivered
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.980]   "into the hands of men and they will kill him.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.740]   "And when he has been killed, he will rise three days later."
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.420]   Just in case you missed it the first time,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.860]   let me say it again.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.900]   I will be killed, I will be killed.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.620]   But they did not understand the statement
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.060]   and they were afraid to ask.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.220]   Next time you read the Gospels, highlight that statement.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.020]   They were afraid to ask.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.900]   'Cause this happens repeatedly in Jesus's ministry.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.140]   They just didn't get it because their paradigm
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.420]   of their worldview of the Messiah
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.500]   just didn't fit what Jesus was saying.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.260]   It fit what Jesus was doing
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.020]   because it said Messiah's going to come,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:45.220]   he's going to give bread, he's going to bring in an era
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.460]   where broken people are gonna be healed,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.780]   the lame are going to walk, the blind are going to see.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.540]   So he fulfills every part of the identification
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.260]   of the Messiah, but what he was saying
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.660]   didn't make any sense.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.180]   So they were hearing him say, "Oh, dying.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.940]   "Maybe he means sleeping now."
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.700]   Because sleeping means living, maybe living means dying.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.260]   I don't know what he means, but they didn't understand.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.940]   Verse 33, "They came to Capernaum
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.740]   "and when he was in the house, he began to question them,
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.580]   "What were you discussing on the way?
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.500]   "But they kept silent, for on the way
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.940]   "they had discussed with one another
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.820]   "which of them was the greatest."
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.940]   Can you imagine that?
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.540]   I mean, we can understand the frustration
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.380]   that Jesus may have been in.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.020]   He's preparing them for his death and burial
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.460]   and on the side, they're having a conversation
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.980]   about who's gonna be the greatest.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.100]   So it's the written word, so we don't have
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.020]   a lot of exclamation marks, but I'm guessing
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.900]   in this scene too, there's a bit of yelling.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.580]   That's my guess, right?
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.500]   There's a lot of knocking on the head, you knuckleheads.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.140]   I just told you I'm gonna die.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.780]   And the discussion that you're having,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.900]   the thing that you're concerned about,
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.700]   who's the greatest, who do you think?
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.940]   I'm gonna die in three days.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.980]   Yeah, okay, who's the greatest, who's the greatest?
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.580]   Mark makes it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.540]   It wasn't a misunderstanding.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.260]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't make it clear.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.860]   It just didn't fit their paradigm of what they wanted.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.500]   So they heard him and they filed it away
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.100]   because after his resurrection,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.700]   they recollect all of this stuff.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.100]   He did say this, he did say he was gonna get beaten.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.420]   He did say he was gonna resurrect on the third day,
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.220]   but all of that didn't click until it actually happened
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.740]   and then he was resurrected.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.220]   So they did hear him, they just didn't understand him
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.780]   because it didn't fit.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.340]   Finally, in Mark chapter 10, 33 to 37, saying,
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.820]   "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.200]   "and the Son of Man will be delivered
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.100]   "to the chief priests and the scribes,
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.840]   "and they will condemn him to death
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.420]   "and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.080]   "They will mock him and spit on him
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.780]   "and scourge him and kill him,
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.940]   "and three days later, he will rise again."
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.980]   They didn't hear him the two previous time,
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   the third time, he describes in detail
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.440]   that he's gonna be mocked, spit on, scourged, and then killed.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.980]   But look what it says in verse 35.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.660]   James and John, the two sons of Zebedee,
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.500]   came up to Jesus saying,
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.780]   "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you."
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.740]   And he said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.140]   They said to him, "Grant that we may sit one on your right
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.380]   "and one on your left in your glory."
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:39.320]   I mean, talk about like, can you imagine?
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.580]   Jesus just said he's gonna be spit on, scourged,
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.160]   mocked, and then killed.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.260]   And then said, "Okay, yeah, but who's gonna sit
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.580]   "on your left and right?"
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.340]   Man, Jesus was one patient man.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.480]   He was patient.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.240]   Like, what human being would tolerate this?
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.720]   And not only did they not understand,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.700]   Jesus already knew that at the time of his suffering
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.300]   that they were going to scatter.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.460]   And no matter how determined Peter was,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.100]   no matter how determined Thomas was,
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.040]   and the disciples were, when push came to shove,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.880]   they weren't going to stand with him.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.360]   And yet, Jesus kept on going to the cross.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.840]   The disciples were dense.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.040]   They just did not understand.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   And the reason why they did not understand
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.760]   is because Jesus and what he was saying
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.440]   did not fit their pursuit.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.680]   Their ambition blinded them to the truth.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.520]   Now, we could read this and say,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.020]   "Wow, they're so dense, they're so dumb."
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.620]   But I hope as we read this,
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.580]   that you and I could easily see ourselves
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.680]   in that same position.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.000]   Because there are very plain things
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.080]   that are taught in scripture
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.200]   that majority of the confessing Christians,
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.960]   almost like they've never heard it.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.400]   If you seek your life, he says, you will lose it.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.880]   But he who loses life for my sake, he will find it plain.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.640]   And he repeats that over and over.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.680]   If you want to follow after me,
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.520]   pick up the cross and follow after me.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.360]   Plain.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.960]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.740]   and all these other things shall be added unto you.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.980]   We memorize these scripture,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.920]   we teach this to our children,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.380]   but how much of this is actually being applied?
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.960]   If somebody was to read this 2000 years later
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.320]   of what our life looks like and what the Bible teaches,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.800]   and then they studied the disciples,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.840]   I don't know if there's gonna be a huge gap
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.200]   between them and us.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.520]   What this teaches us is that they had
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.840]   front row seats to Christ.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.740]   They saw him live.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.560]   They saw all of his powerful miracles
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.840]   and yet because of their ambition,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.520]   even though they believed him,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.860]   even though they trusted him,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.540]   because of their personal ambitions,
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.940]   he was going through one year and out the other.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.440]   Years ago, Steve Camp had a song called
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.400]   Marbles, Playing Marbles with Diamonds.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.920]   I'm not gonna read the whole thing.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.540]   And I think there's a few of you
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.840]   that may remember this song.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.280]   And this song goes like this.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.300]   Ah, there's a whole lot more than preaching to the choir,
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.920]   kneeling at the altar or paying our tithe.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.280]   We've been treating God like he's happiness for hire.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   We've been playing marbles with diamonds.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.120]   Isn't it a shame how his name gets thrown around?
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.460]   We pat God on the back like a buddy from out of town.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.480]   We thank the man upstairs for the things
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.120]   people praise us for.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.720]   Oh, we give God the glory,
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.600]   but we're happy to take the award.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.440]   Ah, there's a whole lot more than raising lots of money,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.860]   building our churches and spreading our fame.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.260]   Faith is just the dice that you roll to get lucky.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.900]   We've been playing marbles with diamonds.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.040]   As Jesus is heading to the cross
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.760]   and we celebrate his death and resurrection,
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.040]   do we recognize ourselves?
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.960]   Do we ourselves recognize what this day means for us?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.600]   Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected for our sins.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.860]   And we may also have a new life in him.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:28.640]   But to their credit, even though they didn't understand,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.560]   even though their own ambitions blinded them,
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.460]   they believed him.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.600]   And they continue to follow him.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.400]   Even if they failed, Thomas says at the end of that scene,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.560]   "Well, let us go then."
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.840]   I don't fully get what he is saying,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.160]   but let us go with him.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.300]   And if he's going to die, let us die with him.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.140]   And so they go.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.740]   Many of us are probably in that same situation.
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.020]   We don't fully understand what God is doing,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.520]   why I'm in the situation that we're in.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.940]   And I don't know what God has planned at the end of this,
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.380]   but I'm gonna keep following.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.700]   Scene three.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.640]   Jesus finally shows up in 17 to 27.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.480]   So when Jesus came,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.820]   he found that he had already been in the tomb for four days.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.020]   So he stays two days.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.580]   It takes him a couple of days to get there.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.540]   And by the time he shows up,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.140]   he's already been buried for four days.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.560]   Now, Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.020]   and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.540]   to console them concerning their brother,
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.180]   which already tells us that this was a very public miracle.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.940]   This didn't just involve a few people.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.300]   Many people were already there.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.740]   And this was because they were a very prominent family.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.800]   The fact that he was buried in a cave
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.180]   already tells us that he came from a rich family.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.900]   An average family would not have been able
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.220]   to afford that kind of a burial.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.900]   So he was a very well-known, well-respected family.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.540]   Many Jews are there to mourn with them.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.340]   In verse 20, "Martha, therefore,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.520]   "when she heard that Jesus was coming,
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.740]   "went to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.940]   "Martha then said to Jesus,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.560]   "Lord, if you had been here,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.380]   "my brother would not have died."
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.820]   In that statement, you can tell that there is disappointment.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.120]   I thought you cared.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.980]   We already told you that he was ill.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.920]   Why did it take you so long to get here?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.320]   If you had been here, he would not have died.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:31.220]   You see, for mankind, as long as we live,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.860]   as long as we live, there's always hope.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.480]   Because you can start over with the business,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.460]   you can get another job, relationship goes sour,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.760]   maybe have another relationship, there's always hope.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.200]   But the reason why the whole world is shut down right now
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.340]   is because if you die, that's it.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.700]   And even if we lose money, even if the economy tanks,
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.360]   even if all the businesses shut down,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.860]   because our greatest fear
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.800]   and our final judgment is the death,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.420]   we're gonna do, even if we sacrifice everything,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.300]   we have to live.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.860]   God allows Martha to experience this grief.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.380]   And when he says to Jesus, "If you had been here,
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.840]   "my brother would not have died."
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.040]   You know, but Martha, remember,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.480]   she's the one who's always running around busy,
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.680]   and she was complaining about Mary.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.440]   Remember, Jesus said, "Martha, Martha,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.960]   "you were worried about so many things."
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.720]   Mary has chosen what is best.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.780]   Mary was just sitting there eating up Jesus's words.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.660]   So maybe Martha paid attention
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.600]   because in the very next verse,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.260]   after she says that in an accusatory tone to Jesus,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.160]   she has some hope.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.180]   But even now, I know that whatever you ask God,
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.780]   God will give you.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.820]   Doesn't that sound a lot like us?
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.260]   But we believe.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.500]   We believe.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.540]   But God, what are you doing?
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.800]   I worship you.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.520]   I tithe, I give.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.680]   I serve.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.280]   But what are you doing?
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.420]   So you could see the conflict in Martha.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.820]   Why didn't you come?
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.200]   And even though she has very small faith,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.440]   but even now, see, Lazarus was not the first person
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.840]   that he was going to raise.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.660]   If you read the Gospels, in Luke chapter seven,
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.080]   he raises a widow's son, Nain.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.920]   In Matthew chapter nine, he raises Jairus's daughter.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.340]   So they might not have been there,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.320]   but they probably heard about this.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.340]   And even though they're experiencing grief,
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.560]   there is glimmer of hope.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.600]   Even now, I know that whatever you do,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.960]   like even now, that God will give you.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.620]   Now, she doesn't know what he's going to do,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.560]   but as long as you're here, I have some hope.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.960]   We are all in the same place.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.720]   And what the theologians call here and not yet.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.880]   We've all tasted the goodness of God.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.460]   As Christians, we confessed him as Lord and Savior.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.280]   But from now until he comes,
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.500]   we're going to be wrestling with that,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.740]   living in two worlds.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.200]   Where our hope goes up and down based upon what we see,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.040]   based upon our bank account,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.360]   whether the stimulus check gets put into our bank account,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   and that day, it's probably going to feel good for a day.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.260]   And then the memory of that fades,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.200]   and then our hope fades with it.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.360]   And we live, because we live in two worlds.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.720]   And we see Martha, she's disappointed with Christ,
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.280]   and yet she's maintaining her faith.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.040]   That's why in 2 Corinthians 4, 7, it says,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.740]   "so that the surpassing greatness of the power
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.860]   "will be of God, not from ourselves."
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.080]   That our hope may not look like anything,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   because it's contained in an earthen vessel,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.860]   jars of clay.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.000]   But what it contains is powerful.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.920]   Jesus, in response to that, says in John 11, 25,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:22.020]   "He who believes in me will live, even if he dies."
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.440]   And obviously, he's pointing to Lazarus.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   "I know he's dead, but even in death, he will live."
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:37.040]   See, for human beings, there is no hope after death.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.760]   At least during this lifetime, you can start over.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.960]   You can repeat, or you can do something else.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.720]   You can change your mind, you can move.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.960]   But if you die, it's final.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.440]   But Jesus says, at the core of mankind's darkness,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   it's that even in that, even if he dies, he shall live.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.120]   And everyone who lives and believes me will never die.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.580]   Says, do you believe this?
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.840]   Jesus didn't say, trust me, I'm gonna make him live.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.560]   Jesus didn't say, if you continue to come after me,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.720]   I will show you the way of life.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.600]   He says, I am the resurrection and the life, I am.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.480]   Meaning, Christ himself is life.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.000]   We talked about that last week.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   Jesus is not simply the way to life.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.920]   He says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.680]   That's why the greatest evidence of a man or a woman
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.160]   or a child who's been born again is his union with Christ.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.080]   Does he have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   The question is not, do you go to church,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.140]   do you read your Bible, do you do great things,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.200]   are you generous, are you involved in helping the poor?
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.840]   That's not a question, that's not the distinguishing mark
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.200]   of a Christian and non-Christian,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.080]   because Jesus says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.640]   Is there a personal affection relationship
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   with the man and God, Jesus Christ?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.600]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.840]   That's why in 1 John 5, verse 12, it says,
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.280]   he who has the son has the life.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.880]   If you have the son, you have the life.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.580]   He who does not have the son of God does not have the life.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.720]   The life he is talking about is not simply not dying.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.560]   The Bible uses two different words, bios and zoe.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.720]   Bios is the biological life, zoe means to be alive.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.400]   He's not simply saying that God is going to preserve us
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.740]   from physically dying.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.320]   He's going to give us life.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.920]   What God intended from the beginning,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.800]   this union with the author of life
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.300]   that was broken because of our sins.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.800]   He says, if you come to me, he says, I am the life.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:00.560]   You know how you can recognize somebody who is near Christ?
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.620]   Almost always.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.840]   There's joy.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.600]   It doesn't matter if they're sitting in prison.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   It doesn't matter if they have disease.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.180]   It doesn't matter if they're in their deathbed.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.440]   It doesn't matter if they have a large bank account
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.880]   or many friends.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.580]   You can always tell when somebody is near Christ,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.580]   there's always joy because Jesus is life.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.480]   Jesus is the resurrection.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.560]   And that's why Jesus turns to Martha.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.720]   He doesn't just say, I am the resurrection and the life
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.600]   because the point of why he came,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.400]   he could have said that up in heaven.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.720]   But the whole reason why he came was the next question.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.560]   Do you believe this?
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.200]   Do you believe this?
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.520]   He wasn't simply declaring to the world, I am life.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.120]   He wasn't simply trying to display his glory.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.280]   His whole point was from that, do you believe this?
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   Because the Bible says, if you confess with your mouth
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.520]   that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.440]   that Christ was raised from the dead,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.940]   that you will be saved.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:13.480]   The whole point of the resurrection Sunday is that question.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.520]   Do you believe that?
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:20.600]   Is the penalty of sin still dominating your life?
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.840]   Is the fear of death, has it gripped our lives
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.520]   and we're doing everything possible to avoid it
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.680]   because we don't know?
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.800]   Jesus says, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.160]   Scene four, Jesus meets Mary.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.960]   This section, I wanna start from verse 32.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.600]   Therefore, then Mary came where Jesus was.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.680]   She saw him and fell at his feet saying to him,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.840]   Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.520]   And again, her disappointment.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.760]   I mean, think about Mary just a few days earlier,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.960]   not that long ago.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.500]   She humiliated herself.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.000]   Now again, that would be humiliating for anybody,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.080]   but this was a prominent family,
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.320]   very wealthy family, a dignified family.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.920]   So for Mary to be on her knees,
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.200]   wiping Jesus' feet with oil,
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.320]   is a position of even a humble servant
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.760]   would have been humble to do.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   Mary, we don't know the depth of her faith,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   but she loved Jesus so much that she was willing to do that.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.460]   So you can see the disappointment in Mary's tone
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.840]   when she asked Jesus, Lord, if you had been here,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.140]   my brother would not have died.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.940]   You know, I think in the English, in the written word,
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.620]   it comes off the same, but I have a feeling
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.740]   that Martha's tone and Mary's tone was very different.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.180]   You know, 'cause Martha is the outgoing one.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.380]   She's the one who's outspoken,
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.740]   and she was the one who was telling Jesus, rebuke Mary!
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.540]   And Mary just sitting there quietly just studying.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.120]   So I have a feeling they said the exact same thing,
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.920]   but Martha probably said, Lord!
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.280]   She probably ran up to him
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.640]   and called his name from a distance.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.520]   If you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.440]   Mary, for whatever reason, I see her as an introvert.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.880]   You don't hear a lot from her.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.440]   She's just a woman of action.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   If you have been here, my brother would not have died.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.500]   And there's a deep-seated disappointment
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.440]   in Christ in those words.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.700]   Why did you allow this to happen?
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.780]   You know how much you mean to us.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.580]   And I know how much Lazarus meant to you,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.620]   and I know how much you loved our family,
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.300]   but why did you let this happen?
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.780]   Verse 33, "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping,
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.640]   "and the Jews who came with her also weeping,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.180]   "he was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled."
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.140]   And said, "Where have you laid him?"
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.340]   They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:12.380]   This is the shortest verse in all of the English Bible.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.780]   It says, "Jesus wept."
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.080]   Now, you have to understand
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.500]   that when the original Bible was written,
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.140]   there were no verses, there were no chapters.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.060]   It didn't happen until about 1300 AD.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.240]   The chapters came in,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.560]   and then it was another 300 years after that
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.440]   where the verses came in.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.360]   So whoever put the verses in wanted to highlight,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.640]   Jesus wept, 'cause he made it one verse.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.400]   Jesus wept.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.880]   So we shouldn't just pass this by and say, "Jesus wept."
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.080]   There's a reason why this one verse,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.760]   this shortest English verse, is highlighted,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.580]   because it has tremendous significance.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.800]   There's only two places, one other place outside of here,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.240]   where the same word for weeping is used of Christ,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.440]   and that was used last week at the Palm Sunday.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.720]   When Jesus looked at the multitude crying out to him,
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.980]   "Hosanna, hosanna," it says, "Jesus wept."
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:18.680]   Now, we can understand Jesus is in front of the burial site
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.200]   of Lazarus, whom he loved.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.940]   So it makes sense that he would weep,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.580]   because he saw the sorrow of the people.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.180]   And we can just superficially say, "Oh, he was sad,"
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.320]   like we would be sad.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.600]   But what is perplexing was Jesus himself said,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.240]   "He's not going to die."
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.020]   You know, if he was crying because of their sadness,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.900]   you would think that Jesus would kind of have a smirk
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.300]   on the side of his face, "Just wait, right?
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.860]   "I know you're sad, but just wait.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.480]   "I took two days on purpose."
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.140]   So did he forget?
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.800]   Or was he just emotionally overwhelmed,
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.020]   and he just kind of like couldn't help it,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.680]   'cause they were weeping?
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.240]   What is the meaning behind his weeping?
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.140]   You see, both times when Jesus was weeping,
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.980]   he saw judgment coming.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.800]   The Bible says that because of man's rebellion,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.000]   the final judgment on all mankind is death.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.260]   Right now, 100% of us who are born will die.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.500]   And that's not a guess.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.160]   100% of us at some point, whether we die early,
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.840]   whether we die late, we will die.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.560]   There's not a single human being that lived among us
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.740]   who didn't experience the termination of his life
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.800]   one way or the other.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.740]   The Bible says the clearest evidence
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.540]   of the ramification of man's sin is death.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:56.200]   So I believe that Jesus was weeping for the same reason
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.800]   that he was weeping on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   He was weeping because at the face of death,
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.160]   he sees the judgment on mankind.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.880]   He wasn't simply weeping because he was temporarily asleep,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.080]   like he said, 'cause he was just about to raise him.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.100]   I don't know about you, but it gives me tremendous,
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.480]   tremendous comfort to know
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:27.020]   that Jesus did not simply satisfy the legal code
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.840]   that God required.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.580]   He didn't just come into the court and say,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.520]   "You know what?
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.340]   "I'm a public defender, so I'm gonna do my best
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.160]   "to defend him and then go my way."
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.400]   That's not what happened.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.380]   He didn't just satisfy the legal requirement
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.120]   that we needed to save us from eternal judgment.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.260]   The Bible says he saw our sins and he had compassion on us.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.540]   This compassion is what led to his weeping.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.640]   I don't know about you, but it gives me tremendous comfort
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.120]   to know that my Savior loves me to this degree.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:14.820]   He wept for me and he wept for you.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.720]   And that's why we celebrate this day.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.580]   What was so ugly on Friday
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.140]   turns into the greatest celebration on Sunday
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.940]   because Christ wept for us.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:34.260]   Every single one of us, we know.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.020]   We know the darkness that's inside.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.460]   We know that in private, there are things
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.660]   that we don't wanna show the public,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.700]   so when we come to church, we put on the best dress,
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.420]   we put on, do our hair, and we make sure
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.820]   that we speak a certain way, we look a certain way,
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   we act a certain way, all of it because
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.380]   we don't want you to see behind the curtain.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:58.960]   Because there's a nervousness in all of us
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.060]   that there are certain parts of our lives
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.760]   that once they see, they might not want to be with us.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.060]   There's a certain fear in all of us
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.220]   that once the curtain is drawn
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.340]   and they're able to see every aspect,
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.580]   every thought that I have, everything that I do
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:20.040]   that people don't know of, they don't wanna be my friend.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.840]   They wouldn't want me in this community.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.720]   Every one of us has that fear.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.700]   And to be honest, to many degrees, it's true.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.180]   And that's why marriage oftentimes is so hard
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.300]   because you can't hide from your husband and your wife
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.800]   like you do everybody else.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.100]   You may do a good job with everybody else
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.660]   to keep enough distance and you've done a great job,
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.860]   but you get married, you can't hide.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.700]   And eventually, it comes out.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.060]   And when it comes out, there's that temptation.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.140]   This is not what I thought.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:58.020]   Christ saw every ugliness in a sinner like me and you.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:04.960]   And instead of being disgusted, he wept over us.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.260]   He embraced us even harder.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:15.020]   He drew near and he took our sorrows upon himself.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:20.180]   It's a tremendous comfort to know
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.000]   that this is the degree to which he loves us.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.020]   Finally, in scene five, Lazarus is raised,
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.020]   what we've been waiting for.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.460]   All of that was a setup for this.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.460]   So Jesus, again, being deeply moved within,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.080]   came to the tomb.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.380]   Now it was a cave and a stone was lying against it.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.700]   And Jesus said, "Remove the stone."
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.900]   Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him,
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.260]   "Lord, by this time, there will be a stench."
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.540]   You know what's funny about this?
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.360]   Because in the old English, in the KJV, it says,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.620]   "Lord, it stinketh."
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.520]   That's what it says.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.020]   In the King James Version, it's very direct.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.140]   "Lord, it's been four days.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.380]   "It stinketh."
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.060]   I don't know what it sounds like in Greek,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.740]   but in the old English, it's very direct.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.640]   "He stinks.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.500]   "If you roll that stone away now,
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.200]   "I mean, he's not gonna be Lazarus."
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.500]   Like, remember I told you,
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.260]   Martha is kind of like juggling this.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.460]   I believe you, but he's gonna stink.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.420]   What are you doing?
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.540]   Lord, verse 40, Jesus said to her,
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.900]   "Did I not say to you that if you believe,
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.540]   "you will see the glory of God?"
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.400]   In other words, do what I say.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.440]   Then Jesus raised his eyes and said,
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.600]   "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.780]   "I knew that you always hear me,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.600]   "but because of the people standing around,
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.660]   "I said it so that they may believe that you sent me."
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.960]   And when he had said these things,
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.480]   he cried out with a loud voice,
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.160]   "Lazarus, come out!"
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.780]   You know what's amazing about this?
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.020]   That's all it took.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.420]   Jesus didn't have a prayer meeting,
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.660]   he didn't have a fasting, he didn't put mud on,
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.880]   he didn't say, you know, give it some time.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.540]   You know, he didn't say, "Get the oil ready,
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.740]   "remove the stone, and we're gonna get on."
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.100]   Nothing, he's just like, "Step back.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.040]   "I told you what I'm gonna,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.340]   "you're about to see the glory of God."
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.900]   And all he does was, "Lazarus, come out!"
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   That's it.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.700]   And it may be amazing to us,
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.540]   but the Bible says, by the proclamation of his word,
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.960]   the whole world was created.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.300]   So it may be amazing to us, but for God,
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.300]   all it took was for him to say, "Come out."
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.620]   It was just simple words, "Come out,"
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.980]   coupled with his authority.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.580]   It was not a big deal.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.920]   I mean, that almost sounds blasphemous to say,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.920]   but to God, all he needed to do to raise a dead man
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.820]   who was dead for four days,
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.660]   with complete lost hope for every single person
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.740]   that was there who was weeping and crying
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:20.820]   because they're so saddened,
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.420]   'cause there's no hope in death,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.700]   all Jesus had to do was to say, "Come out."
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.820]   And he came out, look what happens.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.500]   Then the man who had died came forth,
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.320]   bound hand and foot with wrappings,
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.380]   and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.660]   Jesus said to them, "Unbind him and let him go."
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.860]   I don't know what Lazarus was thinking.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.180]   It'd be interesting if we were to do a play with this scene.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.940]   Lazarus coming up, jumping out from this,
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.260]   and what he was thinking.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.280]   What is this?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.520]   What happened?
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.820]   Did you see a bright light at the end of the tunnel
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:00.660]   when you died?
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.540]   What was it like?
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.220]   He'd be an interesting person to ask,
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.060]   'cause everybody's guessing,
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.300]   but he actually died for four days.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.340]   What were you doing?
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.780]   Did you see Moses?
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.140]   Was Elijah there?
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:16.740]   You know what's interesting?
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.580]   He comes out.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.980]   And then you would think they threw a party
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.540]   and there was a revival that broke out, nothing.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.460]   He came out.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.380]   Many people saw the glory and they believed.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:34.520]   And then some of them went to the Pharisees and told them.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.460]   Wow, even after that,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.200]   even after that,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.840]   people who are already committed,
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.000]   already shut their hearts,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.620]   even in the face of a great miracle,
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.500]   they were gonna go down that path.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.400]   Why did God allow this?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.500]   He allowed them to experience desperation,
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.720]   sadness, disappointment, grieving.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.800]   All of that was God ordained for the purpose of his glory.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.520]   It was ordained.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.400]   Much of our suffering is ordained for his glory.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.380]   Much of the persecution in the church
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.020]   has been ordained for his glory.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:27.280]   Even Lazarus's death was ordained for his glory.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.460]   Story just moves on.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.700]   You know, you would think that
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.580]   if you were to read any story
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.100]   and you have five scenes,
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.660]   that Lazarus comes back from the dead, the end.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.540]   It's like, how can it get any higher than this?
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:49.180]   But all of this was a precursor about the real story.
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.400]   Because he moves on from here.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.300]   And this is where he begins to prepare
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.060]   and he goes into Jerusalem.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.420]   Because all of this was to prepare for them
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.340]   for the real hope that is coming in Christ.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:08.340]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 52 to 57, it says,
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.960]   "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   "at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.760]   "and the dead will be raised imperishable
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.380]   "and we will be changed.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.340]   "For this perishable must put on the imperishable
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.340]   "and this mortal must put on immortality.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.980]   "But when the perishable will have put on the imperishable
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.660]   "and this mortal will have put on immortality,
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.740]   "then will come about the saying that is written,
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.920]   "death is swallowed up in victory.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.560]   "Oh, death, where is your victory?
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.720]   "Oh, death, where is your sting?
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.180]   "The sting of death is sin
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.780]   "and the power of sin is the law.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.260]   "But thanks be to God,
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.740]   "who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.040]   Lazarus's resurrection was just for himself.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.140]   Jesus's resurrection was for all of us.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.320]   He took the sting of death away.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.800]   Now, even as Christians, we don't wanna die.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.280]   We wanna spend as much time as we can with our children,
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.680]   with our friends and family.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.440]   But the sting of death has been taken away
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.640]   because death leads us
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.520]   to the eternal presence of Christ Jesus.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.420]   Colossians 3, 4 says, "When Christ, who is your life,
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.080]   "appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.880]   I pray that the resurrection of Christ
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.260]   would not just simply be something
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.760]   that we remember and celebrate
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   like we do like July 4th or our anniversaries,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.560]   and then we move on to the rest of our life.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.040]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ changes everything.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.200]   The Bible says that we were buried with him
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.880]   so that we may also be raised with him,
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.820]   not to a better life, but to a complete new life.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:06.000]   My prayer is that all of you out there listening,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.440]   our church members outside the church,
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.820]   do you know this Christ?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.440]   If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.360]   and believe in your heart
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.880]   that Christ was raised from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.400]   Are you weighed down by your sin?
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.320]   Are you afraid of death
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.400]   because you don't know what's coming after?
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.960]   I pray that you would meet this resurrected Christ.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.120]   I pray that you would meet this Christ
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.320]   that you and I would have this conviction
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.800]   that have this hope eternal.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.980]   Take some time to pray with me as we seek the Lord together.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:51.960]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.840]   Millions of us all around the world thank you in unison.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:59.040]   All the saints that have gone before us
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.280]   with cloud of witnesses,
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.520]   all the saints that will come after us,
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.840]   in unison we praise you and we thank you
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:11.300]   for not turning away when you saw our sins,
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.820]   for having compassion,
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:19.860]   for taking upon yourselves our sorrows, our griefs,
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.420]   that you may be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.660]   I pray, Father God, that as you invite us
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.260]   to come to the throne of grace with confidence,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.340]   that that is exactly what we will commit to do,
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.620]   to continue to come to you,
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.140]   that we may have this life and have it abundantly.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.900]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
