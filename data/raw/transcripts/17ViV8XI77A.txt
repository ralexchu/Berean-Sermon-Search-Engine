[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   It is an eight-week course that will cover
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   the foundational doctrines of the Christian faith,
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   but it's going to serve as a platform
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   to talk about, and this is why
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.340]   our philosophy of ministry
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.340]   and how we run church is this way.

[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.340]   And if you know that you're going

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   You could even prepay for the event
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   and then just come show them that you paid

[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   The family ministry is going to be
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   having several things happening
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   in the month of February 1st.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   On February 1st, Saturday at 2 p.m.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   here in the main sanctuary,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   the family ministry is going
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.460]   to be having a workshop.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   So there'll be some teaching,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.460]   talking about the ministry.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.460]   So please come to participate in that.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.460]   There will be child care provided
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.460]   and refreshments as well.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.460]   The family ministry also will be having
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.460]   a prayer meeting on Saturday the 8th
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   from 9.15 a.m. in the youth chapel,
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.460]   which is across the courtyard there
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.460]   to gather together to pray.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.460]   So please mark that on your calendar
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   and participate in that.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.460]   The last thing I'll say is that
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.460]   while we're still going on,
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.460]   please make sure you sign up as early as possible
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.460]   once you know your schedule
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   and how you'd like to sign up.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.460]   We've been mentioning that we are going
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.460]   to be studying the hermeneutics
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.460]   and the study of how to approach
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   the scriptures and the methodology
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.460]   of how to arrive at a correct interpretation.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   So we are going to be practicing
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.460]   how to cover different genres of scripture,
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.460]   studying specific passages
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.460]   both in the Old Testament and the New.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.460]   So make sure that you sign up
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.460]   so that we can put you into the proper groups.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.460]   Okay. Then the last thing I'll mention is,
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.460]   again, for those of you who may have missed it,
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   we have our same format of the offering
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.460]   that you can submit it both digitally on the app
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.460]   or through the link or we have the check.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.460]   But we did make a change at the beginning of the year.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.460]   So if you tap on the app
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.460]   and it prompts you to submit a new form of payment
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.460]   or to reenter the information,
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.520]   please know it's because we changed the service
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.520]   of who handles that kind of transaction
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   and nothing's wrong with the system,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   that kind of thing.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   You'll just have to reenter the information there, okay?
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.520]   So let me take a moment to pray for us
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   as we go into time of offering.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   Let's pray.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   Our God, we thank you so much.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   Heavenly Father, we are grateful
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   for your presence in our lives,
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   the strength that you provide,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.520]   and God, the encouragement
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.580]   that you give to us every day
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.580]   that, God, you sustain us in this life.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.580]   And what's more, we're so thankful
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.580]   for the promises, for the plans that you have for us,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.580]   a God that ultimately you desire
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.580]   a life of eternity with you
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.580]   in closeness and true harmony.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.580]   And for all of that, we thank you and praise you.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.580]   We ask, God, that the more and more time goes by
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.580]   and we look forward to your coming,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.580]   we look forward to our future abode with you,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.580]   that, God, our hearts would grow
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.580]   in anticipation, love, and affection for you.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.580]   And so even now, God, as we give offering,
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.580]   I pray that it would truly be the expression of our love.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.580]   I ask, God, that it would be
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.580]   the expression of our gratitude
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.580]   and also just knowing that you truly own all things.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.580]   God, everything belongs to you
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   and you deserve every part of who we are.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.580]   And we also pray that, God,
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.580]   you would continue to do your work
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.640]   and pray that you would use us,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.640]   this church and all of its testimony,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   the members, our time, our services,
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   that all of that would be truly used for your glory.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   Amen.

[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:21.480]   - As you guys know, the missions team to Korea,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.480]   they're off on Thursday night,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   and we wanna be praying for them for an effective time
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   of preaching the gospel.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   The Korea team, they're running English camps,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   they're setting up evening meetings,
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   and we really pray that even though it's a short trip,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   that God would truly maximize the time,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   allowing them to be energized and continue to work.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   And then right after, there's a good portion of the team
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   that will go straight to India.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   There's five members of the Korea team
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   that will go straight over,
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   and they're gonna be spending time there
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   visiting both the pastors and doing ongoing ministry,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   so let's lift that up in prayer.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   And then what's more, you guys are well aware
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   of the fires that's been happening,
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   and because it's so close to home,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   I know that there are members of our church
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   who have friends and family and parents or whatnot,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   and with the news stating that it's closing
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.480]   in our almost past 40,000 acres of land
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   and so many different properties that were burned,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   and then even the death toll continuing to rise.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   Let's really pray that God's comfort,
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   God's hand would be experienced and felt during this time.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Would you please join me in a word of prayer as we begin?
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   Our God, we know, Lord,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.480]   that you are mighty, sovereign, and strong.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   Therefore, God, we pray to you.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   Lord, in the situations like this
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   of natural disaster, of great loss,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   people losing life savings,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   people losing family members,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   people in incredible grief,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   God, there is very little that an individual may do,
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   but Lord God, we know that you can work mightily.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   So we pray for your presence.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   We pray for your comfort.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   We do ask that as we have members also
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   who are trying to provide aid,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.480]   whether even working in the fire department,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   we ask that you'd provide strength, energy,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.480]   and sustain them, God, throughout this entire time.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   We also pray, Lord, that in the endeavor,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   our desire to go overseas to reach the lost,
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   to preach the good news of Christ,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.480]   we ask that, God, you would provide the courage.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   You would provide words to say.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   You would lead our church members
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   to individuals where your spirit is working,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   breaking their hearts, causing their ears to be open,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   and illuminating, God, the truth of the Lord Jesus
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   so that, God, they would hear, see, and believe.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   We pray, Father God, in terms of the fruit
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   of the mission's endeavor,
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   in terms of the results.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   We know, Father God, that you are calling.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   We know, Lord, that you desire men to come
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   to repentance and faith.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   And so we ask for that, God,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   that you would cause these meetings,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   the events and programs,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   God, all to be glorifying to you
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   and successful in your sight.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   Please turn your Bible to James 1:1-4.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   And we are going to be
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   hearing familiar words,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   I'm sure you guys have heard this passage,
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   talking about suffering
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   and what perspective we ought to have.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   And in James 1-4,
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   it says, "James, a bondservant of God
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   "and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   "to the 12 tribes who are dispersed abroad,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   "greetings.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   "Consider it all joy, my brethren,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   "when you encounter various trials,
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   "knowing that the testing of your faith
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   "produces endurance.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   "And let endurance have its perfect result
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   "so that you may be perfect and complete,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   "lacking in nothing."
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   As we take a look at this passage,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   I want us to think about suffering,
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   I want us to think about hardships,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   and even just your fears and worries facing them.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   This New Year's, I had the privilege
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   of preaching for our evening service,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   and what I preached was that
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   we are a people beset with worry, anxiety, and fear.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   And so, in thought of last year,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   we want to evaluate what were the worries
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   that burdened us, caused us to be stumbled,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   so that we can look at the New Year with hope,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   with a sense of purpose, et cetera.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.480]   But if you think about it,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   of course we have worries and anxieties,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   and it's normal to have them,
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   because we live in a world that's decaying.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   You live in a body that's decaying.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   We live in a world that's corrupt,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.480]   we live in perilous times where
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   God has said that people will hate you
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   just because of my name.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   God has prepared us for a season of suffering,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   and maybe I should say it another way,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   God has prepared us for a life riddled with suffering.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   And my question to you is,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   do you expect life to be normally peaceful,
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   mostly successful,
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   and then once in a while you hit
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.480]   speed bumps, hurdles, and obstacles?
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   Or do you actually anticipate how the scriptures
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   paint this life for us?
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   And the reason why I say this is because, yes,
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   there are all kinds of things happening right now.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   Again, my face is kind of glued to the news
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   because there's so much going on,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   new fires popping up, et cetera.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   But what's more, just internationally
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   there has been threats of war,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   you know what I mean?
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   Conflict, all kinds of stuff.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   And so if you look at news all around,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   not just local, countrywide, or even internationally,
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   there is so much to worry about.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.480]   And sometimes when I read the news,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   what comes out of my mouth is,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   "What's happening?"
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   My reaction is, "Well, the world's going on!"
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   You know?
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   I mean, it's just a natural response.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   But when I take a moment to think,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   it's like, but that's what scripture said.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.480]   That as the days go by,
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   and as the last days near,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   it's going to be more and more
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   of whether it's moral kind of depravity and corruption,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   whether it's natural disasters,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   or even stuff completely just out of our control.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   We are going to be living a life
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   riddled with suffering.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   And so just jumping right into it,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   this passage challenges us
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   and says not, you know,
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   sometimes there is a time for everything,
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.480]   and once in a while,
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   it's not really a matter of if, is it?
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   It's a matter of when.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   When the various trials come,
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   consider it all joy.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   So to take a moment to meditate and think,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   the first point I wanted to have us meditate
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   is the fact that we are constantly facing trouble,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   and trials are no surprise to us.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   We are constantly facing trouble,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   and trials are no surprise to us.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   When James is speaking to the church,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   he wants this letter to be dispersed,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   primarily because he's speaking to those
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   who have been dispersed because of persecution.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.480]   He's speaking to those who've been displaced,
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   have lost their homes, and they are on the run.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   And when you talk about suffering,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   they've already been scattered.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   They've already been scattered.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   And if you think about just,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.480]   you can imagine what it means to be chased out of town,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   be threatened for your life,
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   have your property confiscated,
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   and then you have no home to go to.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   You don't have a homeland.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   And he says to those who have been dispersed,
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   consider it all joy.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   So, in thinking about this very first point,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   I know in some sense,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   I don't want to overly repeat myself,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   which is in life you will face trouble,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   and that's just a truism.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   But I want to ask you,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   is that something that you have accepted,
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   absorbed, and said it is true
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   from experience and from the scripture,
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   it's proven true,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   or is your response that you've been just fighting
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   as tooth and nail as much as you can,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   avoiding as much conflict,
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.480]   troubles, or hardships as possible.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   But meditate on this.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   It was the Lord Jesus Christ who told us in John 16,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   "These things I've spoken to you
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   so that in me you have peace,
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   but in the world you have tribulation."
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   This is just one of many different passages
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   where our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   was preparing his disciples and every disciple
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   to come after them,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.480]   that you should anticipate and expect
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   that there will be tribulation in your life.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   What's more, every apostle, Apostle Paul,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   I mean, you name it, he's gone through it.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   Loneliness, abandonment.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   He says, "Everybody ditched me in Asia.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   There's no one left."
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   Whether it was people, you know,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   the false accusations,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   false trials, persecutions,
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   being shipwrecked,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   having all kinds of stuff happening,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   going sleepless nights, and he names it,
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   but on top of that, my soul is burdened
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   because the weight of the church,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   the burden of my concern,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   I carry it with me.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   Apostle Peter telling us
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   that we have been left
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   an example of suffering
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   and we would do well to walk in them.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   Trouble comes
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   and it's nothing of a surprise.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   And what's really interesting is in this passage
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   in the book of James,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   it tells us that the trials are manifold.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   The word for, you know, various,
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   it can be translated multiple ways
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   and it's used as synonymously as
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.480]   whether it's multifaceted, okay?
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   Sometimes people make much of this,
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.480]   like in different sermons, that
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   one of the ways this was translated in the Greek text
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   is that this was the multicolored, you know?
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   You get trial of every flavor,
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   that kind of thing.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   And what's more, the term for trial,
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   which is parasmus,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   is where we get the word peril.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.480]   There is danger all about.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   You are not in peaceful times,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   even if, yes, we can thank the Lord
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   that our lives may be overall peaceful,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   but you know that spiritually
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   the scripture has been challenging us.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   You realize you live on a battlefield.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   You live in someone else's territory
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   with the constant threat.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   And that's why scripture tells us
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   that if you're confused,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   sometimes in counseling people always say,
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   "But why? What's the problem?
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   Where did this come from?"
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   Well, scripture says it can come from every direction
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   because you understand the world that you stand on,
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   it is crying out and groaning.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   It's groaning.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   And what kind of groaning is this?
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   It's the groaning of birth pains,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   in sheer pain,
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   intense pain,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   waiting for the day
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   when this earth will be destroyed
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   and when Christ will renew.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   And what's more, in Ephesians chapter 6,
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   Apostle Paul describes,
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   "You live not against just flesh and blood.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   You live fighting against the spiritual forces."
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.480]   And it says, "The spiritual forkness of darkness
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   around this earth,
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   and the prince of the air,
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   and the principalities that surround this world."
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   Meaning the powerful forces at be.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   The tide and the culture and the generation.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   It's all dark and wicked.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   You don't live in a safe place.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   And what's more,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   when we think about the depravity,
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   the moral wickedness,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   you recall that the Lord said in Genesis chapter 6,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.480]   at the time of the flood,
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.480]   "The Lord saw that the wickedness of man
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   was great on the earth
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   was only evil continually."
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   In some sense, we could ask the question,
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   is our generation any better
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   than the flood generation?
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   Is our generation any better
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   than the generation of Sodom and Gomorrah?
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   When God looks down,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   does he see a people whose morality,
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   whose moral sense and justice
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.480]   is actually any better than the days of old?
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   We can make the argument just by statistics.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   How much corruption there is
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.480]   in every layer of leadership to the people.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   How much grotesque immorality there is sexually.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   How much violence is done to the people
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   who are poor, young, or weak.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   You can make the argument it's no better.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   And then King Solomon reminds us and warns us,
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   "You understand that this life is wrought with vanity."
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   And you wonder, "Why?
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   Where is the suffering coming from?"
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   And he reminds us everywhere,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   "You thought you were going to have kids
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   and it was going to be so blessed?"
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.480]   It is. God said to have kids is a blessed thing.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   To have arrows in your quiver, amen.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   But then King Solomon says,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   "But in a world of sin and depravity,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   sometimes the greatest pains come from your children."
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   And he says, "I see this vanity."
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   You pour out into your kid and you give him everything.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   You give him your inheritance and he just curses you.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   And he talks about even the family
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   and he talks about how he was king
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   and he had everything and he thought,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   "If I knew and if I had wisdom, if I had money,
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   if I had possessions and the kingdom was successful."
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.480]   He said, "Vanity. All of it is just vanity."
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   To the point in Ecclesiastes 2, verse 17, he says,
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   "So I hated life.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   For the work which had been done under the sun
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   was grievous to me.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   Because everything is futility and striving after wind."
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.480]   And he was the one who said,
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   "If you had hope anywhere, in yourself, in your money,
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.480]   or even the government."
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   He would say, "You know what, I removed one corrupt guy
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   and another corrupt guy walked in his place.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   This is vanity."
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   And he says, "I hate this."
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   I want to take a moment to pause there and say,
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   I know that right now I'm painting a very depressing picture.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   But in some sense, this is the reality to which God said,
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   "It is wise for you sometime to go into the house of mourning
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   and realize how much this life and this world
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   is wrought with suffering."
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   Right?
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   It is.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   The reason why I'm sharing this is because
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   sometimes I take a moment, studying a passage like this,
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   and I ask myself,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   I'm preaching hard.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   Was your expectation, your value system,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   how you generally just thought of life,
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   in tune with this?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Or, Mark, did you falsely assume
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   that once you became Christian,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   it was just going to be joy, joy, joy,
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   and fellowship, fellowship, fellowship.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   And because, let's say I'm tracing my young adult life
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   and I was thinking about, yeah, because I'm not just dating around,
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   I'm in it for marriage, and I'm supposed to marry
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   a godly, peaceful, beautiful woman.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   I did.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   But did I just expect that to happen in every circumstance?
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   And because I studied the Bible, and because I came and served that church,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   and because I'm a faithful servant of God,
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   what's supposed to happen is,
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   I'm supposed to therefore have obedient children,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   I'm supposed to therefore be spared from all the suffering
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   that exists in this world.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   And when suffering comes my way, all of a sudden,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   I'm like, well, it gives, God.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   But why?
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   And then it starts to reveal,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.480]   I think there was a part of me that just simply assumed,
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   if I'm faithful, of course,
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   of course God is going to make my path smooth.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   Of course God is going to make everything work.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   And suffering is not for me.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   So not true.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   And what's more, God has said multiple times
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   that he is working in such a way
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   that suffering is such a part of life
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   that he is in control.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   Just meditating on this a little bit more,
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   when we look at this chapter in James,
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   I want us to go to chapter 1.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   The suffering, when we talk about where does it come from,
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   I mentioned everything in terms of the suffering that comes from the world
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.480]   that we can't control that comes to us.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   But actually, there's a lot of suffering that comes internally.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   And the book of James actually touches upon
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   the majority of the suffering that comes because of you.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.480]   And so before, I used to actually read James
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   and think like, that's interesting, he just jumps so fast from
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   consider it all joy when you suffer to,
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   and then you're supposed to ask for wisdom.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   And I realized, you know what?
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   A lot of my suffering is because of my stupidity.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   Because I lack wisdom.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   Because I can't make wise decisions.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.480]   What are we supposed to do?
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   We're supposed to pray.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   The suffering we experience causes us to ask God for the wisdom we need.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   What's more, later in verse 9,
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   he talks about how, yes, there is a brother who is in humble circumstance.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   Suffering can come because of your deficiencies.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   Now, it's comparing and contrasting because of your poverty versus riches.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   But he talks about this idea is, you understand, we're all finite.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   And so the suffering comes because we're embedded with finiteness.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   Our lives are short. Our power is limited.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   And my knowledge of all of that is limited.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   And so within that, my limitations produce my suffering.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   And then what's more, over in verse 13,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   he starts to talk about how when you are tempted,
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   let no one say, "Oh, I'm being tempted by God."
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   For God cannot be tempted by evil.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   He himself does not tempt anyone.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   But each one is tempted when he is carried away, enticed by his own lusts.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   Where does suffering come from?
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   Because I can't even control the stuff that's going on in here.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   And my desires are producing in me this bed of death
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   because of the sinfulness in my own heart.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   I hope by walking through some of these passages,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   we are sufficiently meditating on this idea
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   that, yes, there is a host of hardship that come.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   And just because I am in the church
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   and just because I've been trying to live faithful,
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   we dare not simply presume
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   that I am going to be safe from all the sufferings that people experience.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   But sometimes we get surprised.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   And I want to go down some areas
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   because I think people get surprised by loneliness.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   You're in the church.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   This is a church, and we're supposed to have community,
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   and we're supposed to have one another's backs,
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   and we're supposed to have all this stuff.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.480]   But I know that people regularly sometimes feel alone
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   in a room full of 500, 600 people.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   We have 1,200 people,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   and I know sometimes because of other experiences, hardships,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.480]   you may feel alone.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   And I want to minimize that because that is a grievous thing.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   God doesn't expect you to just be like, "I'm okay."
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.480]   You know how with kids when they fall and they start to quiver?
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   Sometimes the parents go, "You're okay. You're okay."
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   And the kid goes, "I'm okay."
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.480]   That's not what God expects you to do.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   We are realists.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.480]   We can face this reality because of Christ.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.480]   Now, sometimes people are shocked by that,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   but also, obviously, we have sometimes moments of great loss.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.480]   We have moments of great disappointment and failure.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   I mean, you can literally do everything right.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   You can be the A student.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   You can be the obedient child who just follows things to the T,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.480]   and yet you can suffer. Amen?
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   You can have a mounting burden, a stress,
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   stuff you never asked for.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   All of a sudden, you're burdened with responsibilities
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   that you never even wanted.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.480]   Sometimes you just are burdened with your own weakness,
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   and then sometimes you're shocked
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   because there is a kind of pain as you get older
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   where the pain doesn't come because someone inflicted you.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   The pain comes because you feel powerless
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.480]   when the people you love are in pain,
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   and you feel powerless to help them.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.480]   And all of a sudden, there's this strange, multicolored variety of suffering.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   Yes?
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   My question to you is, in the midst of that, how do you respond?
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   In the midst of that, what is your initial thought?
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   This isn't normal. What's going on?
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   Is God around? Is He paying attention?
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   That's not us.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.480]   We know the Lord has His careful eye on all of His children,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   and He never slumbers on us. Amen?
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   So I want to encourage you with this passage.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   1 Peter 4, verse 12, and on, it says,
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   which comes upon you for your testing,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ,
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   you may rejoice with exultation.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed,
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.480]   because the spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.480]   Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or thief or evildoer
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   or a troublesome meddler.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed,
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   but is to glorify God in His name."
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   What a beautiful passage.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   It mirrors the passage that we are in now.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   Saying, yes, there's going to be suffering.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   Do not be surprised.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   Do not think that something abnormal is happening to you,
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   that somehow God has it out for you,
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   that somehow He forgot about you, that somehow He doesn't see.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   But rather know the Lord is fully in control.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   He is testing you, and He is going to produce in you glory,
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.480]   and we're going to walk through that.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   In point two, the challenge of the passage is to,
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   rather than just simply react to the situation,
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.480]   rather than simply respond in your flesh when something bad happens,
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   to consider the joy that God has given you,
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   embedded not into your circumstance, but into your faith.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   And so what he says is, "Consider it all joy."
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   What does God expect from us?
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   He does not expect you to just simply think,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   "Happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts."
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   He doesn't want you to simply fake it till you make it,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   and He definitely doesn't want you to simply go into isolation and say,
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   "This is my slow death. I accept my fate."
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   That's called giving up.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   We have so many different ways that people react to suffering,
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   but God is going to say,
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.480]   "I want you to walk this narrow path that leads to joy and blessedness."
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   So in order to do that, within this idea of point number two,
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   first He says, "Consider and know."
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   At some point, you have to exercise a decision.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   In this passage, He says when you experience the suffering
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   or the testing of the various kinds,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   He wants you to consider it all joy,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   and then later He says,
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   "Knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance."
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   So in your mind, you're making biblical conclusions.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   In your mind, you're making actual decisions.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   When I counsel people, this is what I find as a tendency
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.480]   amongst people who have experienced a lot of suffering.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   A lot of times, sometimes people will tell me,
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   "I just can't get over it,"
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   and then I'll walk them through the question.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   I'll just tell me then what was the process, what was the journey, etc.,
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   and then they always have questions.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   "Why did this happen?"
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   "What went wrong?"
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   "Why would they do this?"
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   Then we would talk about God has a purpose, God has a plan,
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.480]   God is sovereign, etc., etc.,
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   and then they just simply repeat the question in another way.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   "But how come this?"
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   "But what was He doing?"
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   "But what's the..."
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   In the end, it's just, "But why?"
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   "But why, but why?"
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   Because they haven't made a decision to accept the fact
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   that God was sovereign in this.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   That's a decision you make.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   That's an end conclusion you make.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   It happened.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   Was God sovereign?
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   And then a lot of times, people who suffer,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   and I don't want to make light of it
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   because sometimes the suffering is so painful,
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   you totally get it.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   You're kind of shell-shocked.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   You're asking questions.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   You're trying to dissect and understand and process it.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   It totally makes sense.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   But at some point, the Scripture challenges us,
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   but you have to make a concerted decision
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   and accept the fact that God is sovereign,
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   past, present, and future.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   Amen?
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   And then what He's trying to do is say
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   that within all the timeline of everything you've experienced,
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   that there is joy embedded,
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   not specifically just in the circumstance,
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   but He's embedded it into you as the person.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.480]   And that's why He's able to say,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   "Consider the future joy."
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   "Consider the future joy."
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   Okay?
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   What do I mean by that?
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   The passage tells us that something you know by your faith
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   is that God has called, God has justified,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   God has sanctified.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   So what He's doing is He is working in you
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   to produce your faith of endurance.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   And what He's going to do is make that endurance
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.480]   produce great, great glory.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   And there is a future joy that we know by faith,
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   and Christ is the one who modeled it,
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   who executed it.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   What do I mean by that?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   You recall in the famous passage, Hebrews 12,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.480]   Hebrews 12, verses 1 through 3,
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.480]   as an encouragement for you to be faithful,
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   as an encouragement for you to not give up,
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.480]   keep on running.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   Scripture says,
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   "surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   "and the sin which so easily entangles us,
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   "and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   "fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   "who for the joy set before Him,"
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.480]   did you catch that?
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   "endured the cross, despising the shame,
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   "and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   "For consider Him who has endured such hostility
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   "by sinners against Himself,
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.480]   "so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   He says, "Fix your eyes on Jesus,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   "because you know that He is the perfecter of your faith."
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   And He Himself looked at the future joy
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   of what is to be accomplished,
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   looked at His future joy of the work
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   that God is accomplishing through Him
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   to bring many sons to glory.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   And He said, as He saw that joy,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   there was no joy in the situation.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   There are some people who think, like,
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Jesus was so powerful, God Almighty in the flesh,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   so nothing fazes Him, right?
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   He kind of walks around like, "Whoa," you know?
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   And He's got this, like, people are screaming at Him,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   doesn't say anything.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   Now, it's true, did He revile in return?
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   No, because He had so much composure, perfect composure.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   And people were threatening His life.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   Did He run for His life?
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   No, He didn't, He had so much composure.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.480]   But do not think that any of His suffering
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   was so beyond Him.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   Jesus wept.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   Jesus told His disciples, "My heart is troubled."
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   Jesus kept on pleading to God.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   Jesus kept on praying.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   Jesus was disturbed.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   It was not as though Jesus was not, like, fazed by anything.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   And then He says, "Ultimately, the cross,
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   which is truly the greatest suffering,"
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.480]   we could possibly begin to fathom.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   If we think about suffering,
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   and it'd be weird to rank or measure
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.480]   which is the greatest degree of suffering, right?
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   But do you know that something profound
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.480]   about the cross and the suffering of Christ
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   has embedded into it every kind of intense
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   and the severity of the suffering
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   was truly unimaginable by man?
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.480]   The sheer rejection, the shame, the humiliation,
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   the true injustice of it all,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.480]   the one pure Son of God,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   chastised, ridiculed, mocked by sinners,
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   vile men who deserve to die,
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.480]   the Creator.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.480]   Scripture says that there's not a thing
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   that came into existence aside from Christ.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   So therefore, these individuals mocking Him
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   are His little creatures,
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   judging Him to the cross.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.480]   But to ultimately face the wrath of God?
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   Unimaginable suffering, yes?
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   But Scripture says,
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   "See Christ, who saw future joy."
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.480]   And for us, we can do the same.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.480]   Why?
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   Because what God is doing in you
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.480]   is He is proving you.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   I'm not sure if you guys have ever heard that
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   or thought about that.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   But my next point, point number sub-point two, three,
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   is consider the joy of God's approval.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   Consider the joy of God's testing.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   But His testing is not to fail you.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   Some of you guys are in the most competitive field.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   You're either in the financial field,
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   you're either in the medical field.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   And the school's purpose
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   is to weed out the weak ones.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   And some of you guys have felt
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.480]   just that kind of pressure.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   Oh my gosh, I need to keep up with these guys
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   because if I don't put in the hours
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   and I'm going to fail.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   This is not the same kind of test.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.480]   The Scripture tells us that in James,
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   chapter one, verse 12.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   Turn your eyes there.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   James, chapter one, verse 12.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   That blessed is a man who perseveres under trial.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   Now that trial, again, it can mean various things
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   and it's been translated various things by context.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   But here and now,
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   it's because God is working in you.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   Because God is approving you,
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   it is better translated or the idea,
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   the trial is your testing.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.480]   Literally, that God is putting you on the exam,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.480]   on the purification.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   And then it says,
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.480]   "For once he has been," what?
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.480]   "Approved, he will receive the crown of life
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   "which the Lord has promised to those who love him."
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.480]   This is future joy.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   Future joy of the crown that God has promised,
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   but future joy to the path that leads us there.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.480]   And the path that leads us there,
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   God has not intended your failure.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   But God has intended the purification of your soul.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.480]   Right?
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   Think about that.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   You guys are probably in a field,
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   a good number of you guys are in a field
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   where you have, we have engineers
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   and we have software engineers
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   and we have people who are producing product, et cetera.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   What do you normally do when you have a launch, right?
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   You have a stress test.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   Even if you produce a software program,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   you just get the whole team and say,
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   "Everybody get on it, let's see if it crashes."
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   And then you're like, "Oh my gosh,
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   "we have so many bugs to fix, da-da-da-da-da."
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   Right?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   You build a structure, you're in architecture
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   or something like that, you have to do stress tests.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   You build a product, you're in mechanical engineering,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   you have to do a stress test, yes?
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.480]   And if you do not, you cannot say,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.480]   "It's proven to be reliable."
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Yes?
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   In the same way,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   God is not trying to just simply break you.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   He is in the work of proving you
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   to be what?
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   To be able to stand.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   To be without blame.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   To be without blemish.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.480]   This is the amazing work of God in your life.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   And God has said that as he looks upon us,
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   yes, any kind of pain is in the moment,
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   suffering and sorrow, and we're allowed to cry.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   But know this, there is joy embedded in this
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   because God, in his wisdom and sovereignty,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   he has said, "Nothing has seized you, but it was common to man,
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   and he will not allow you to be tested beyond what you can handle."
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   Why?
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   Because God is in this process of giving to us
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   that which is the product of our endurance,
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   which is a tenacity,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.480]   which is a strength we had not before,
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   which is a long-suffering,
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   an endurance that we probably did not know we could have.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Why?
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   In of ourselves, we are weak.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   And so, I want us to think about this idea
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   that if ever we have been tempted to think
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   that simply it's Satan who's just making me fail,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   it's other people who are pushing my buttons
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   and pushing me to my limits,
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   you don't have to be like,
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.480]   "Nah, that guy, I need to just get that guy out of my life."
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   You don't have to be like that.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   Why?
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.480]   God is testing you.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.480]   You know what scripture says in Isaiah chapter 45?
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.480]   Isaiah 45, it says that God wanted men to know,
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.480]   and he says, "That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   that there is no one besides me, and I am the Lord.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.480]   There is none other.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   The one forming light and creating darkness,
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.480]   causing well-being and creating calamity.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   I am the Lord who does all these."
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   Who does all these.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   So, I can't speak on behalf of the Lord things I don't know,
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   but if you are going through hardship,
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   and you're sitting there wondering like,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   "Is God involved in this?"
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   100% the answer is yes.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   And then you wonder like, "Is God testing me?"
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   Probably most certainly yes,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   because God says he is going to use every circumstance.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   I can't follow the trail of like,
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   "And God caused this, and that's why this happened,"
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   because my wisdom is too limited.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   But for sure, God called you,
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   and therefore he justified you.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   He is for sure going to sanctify you,
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.480]   and he is going to glorify you. Amen?
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   And therefore, I want to move to the next portion,
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.480]   which says that God is going to perfect us,
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   and knowing this, we have joy embedded again
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   outside of the circumstance of what he is doing in my life,
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.480]   which is he is causing me to be complete.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.480]   The passage in James 1.4 tells us this,
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   "And let endurance have its perfect result,
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   so that you may be perfect and complete,
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.480]   lacking in nothing."
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   It's like, "Wait a minute, but I don't have money."
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   You lack nothing when you have the hand of God on you.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   "But wait a minute, I'm still crying."
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   You lack nothing when God is at work maturing you.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:16.480]   If some of you guys have memorized James 1.4, amen.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   But I hope you don't go home with,
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.480]   "Consider it all joy, consider it all joy, consider it all joy,"
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   and you're experiencing hardship,
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.480]   and you're doing that awkward smile like,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.480]   you're kind of throwing up your hands like,
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   "I know I'm supposed to have a better attitude,
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   but it just hurts." Right?
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   I want to remind you that you have to know verse 4,
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.480]   that you may not be able to go around the trial,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.480]   but God for sure is causing you to go through the trial,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   because he is working in you perfection, completeness,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.480]   and lacking nothing.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   Scripture says that God has such a goal for you,
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   that you will be presented before him holy and blameless.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   God has valued so much that your character would rise
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   from previously depraved and sinful,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   to justified in Christ, previously still in the flesh,
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   to maturing, and God is working in you
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.480]   to rise to the maturity and the stature
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   of the perfect Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.480]   Amen?
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   And he desires in you such completeness,
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   that he wants the maturities of the Lord.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.480]   He wants you to have the maturity of Christ's mind,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   of the way you think and the way you judge.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   He wants you to have the maturity of his heart
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   and the way he feels, how he reacts to people,
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.480]   how much he has compassion, what he wants,
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.480]   and he wants you to react in every single way
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   as Christ would, so that you would have the mind,
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   the words, and the heart of Christ.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.480]   So that when Scripture talks about Jesus,
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.480]   who experienced all kinds of suffering,
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   and therefore he is an incredible mediator,
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.480]   an incredible high priest, who sympathizes with the weak
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   and come to our aid, God wants you to also mature
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.480]   to be that for other people.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   He wants you to have the perfections of Christ.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.480]   There is nothing more valuable than to have
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.480]   the personality, the character trait,
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   and the completeness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   Jesus is more valuable than a life of comfort.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   Amen?
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   The Lord's character in you is more valuable
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   than a life of ease, a life without suffering.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   And this is what God is doing in you.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   An interesting passage in Hebrews 2, verse 10,
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   Hebrews 2, verse 10, says,
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   "For it was fitting for him," that's Jesus,
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   "for whom are all things, and through whom are all things,
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   "in bringing many sons to glory,
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.480]   "to perfect the author of their salvation
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   "through suffering."
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.480]   That's a crazy passage that makes you think,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.480]   like, what?
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.480]   Jesus is perfect.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   Jesus was in perfect harmony with the Father.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.480]   He only did the works the Father wanted him to do,
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   and he only said that which the Father gave him to do.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.480]   There was nothing deficient about Jesus,
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.480]   so how in the world does this passage say
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.480]   that it was only fitting that God would perfect our Savior,
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   who was already perfect, through the suffering?
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   Why?
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.480]   The amazing truth about this passage
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   is his purpose was to bring you to glory.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   It was only fitting for the forerunner,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   the one who's going to be both our example,
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   our trailblazer, the one in which we abide,
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.480]   we get into, we have union with, we follow,
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   and therefore, as he is entering into glory,
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.480]   we enter into glory.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.480]   And when I said just a moment ago,
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.480]   the value of Christ's character is so much more
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   than anything you can imagine put into that statement,
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   the glory of Christ.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.480]   That's what he wants to give you.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   So when we suffer, we can make this consideration.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.480]   God is building within me glory,
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.480]   and this glory is the glory of Christ.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.480]   And the suffering I experienced, Christ experienced.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   Name a suffering Christ did not go through.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.480]   Earlier, I went through a laundry list of loneliness.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   Jesus was surrounded by like 20,000 people.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   Nobody understood him.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   And in the moment of his suffering,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.480]   people denied knowing him, especially his closest friends.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   Think about being hurt
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   because you felt like you were being judged.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.480]   Think about having somebody
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   just have this animosity towards you.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.480]   It's like, "I don't know why."
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   You know, when I was a young Christian,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   I would read the Gospels,
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480]   and then I would just be like,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.480]   "What's wrong with you people?
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   "Just leave him alone!"
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.480]   You know, like, I didn't get it.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   Like, "Jesus is going around teaching and healing people.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480]   "Just leave the guy alone!"
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   You know, like, that's how I'd scream at the passage, you know?
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.480]   Some of you guys have people who are in your life.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   It's like, "Just please leave me alone.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   "Like, why are you hurting me so much?"
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.480]   Name a suffering you experienced
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.480]   that Christ did not experience.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.480]   It was fitting for him because he is your leader,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   but he is your glory,
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.480]   that you too then are perfected through suffering,
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   and you enter into his glory.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   Amen?
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.480]   And so in this, I want to say that there is a joy
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.480]   of loving him and sharing in his suffering.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.480]   When we think outside of the immediate circumstance
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   and the hardships and how painful it is,
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   we realize that God has so desired us
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.480]   to know that he knows us,
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   and to know that we have the comforts
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.480]   because he is our helper.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   But then we also, through the suffering,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   we can sympathize with him.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   And to know then my love to that greater degree,
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   that's amazing.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   That's it.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   And that's why Apostle Paul says,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   "I know what it means to have everything.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   "I had power.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   "I had clout.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   "I had a future.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.480]   "I had people basically following me and my leadership,
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   "and they thought essentially I was going to usher in
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   "like a righteous age of the Jewish people.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   "I lost everything.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.480]   "But I know the secret of contentment,
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.480]   "whether I had everything or I lost everything,
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   "and it's knowing Christ.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   "And if I could share in the sufferings of Christ,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.480]   "I count everything else rubbish."
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   I want you to turn to a pretty profound passage.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480]   In talking about suffering,
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   it's hard to not talk about the suffering of Job, right?
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   Go in your Bibles to Job chapter 23.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.480]   In Job chapter 23,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   Job suffered in such a way where to most people,
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.480]   it just didn't make sense.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   And then to his closest friends, they're like,
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   "Do you only think that makes sense?
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   "You're a bad man.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   "You probably sinned."
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   So Job, as you know,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.480]   he suffered by first losing all of his riches and his cattle,
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.480]   then he suffered by losing all of his children,
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   and then he suffered by losing his health,
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   and it was pitiful.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.480]   He just sat there with boils on his skin.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   With the devastation of his home,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   he picked up broken pottery and just scraped his wounds.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   And then in some sense, he lost his wife.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   She didn't die, but she was cursing God and saying,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   "Why don't you just curse God and die?"
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   He lost the support of his wife,
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   and then he had even more pain
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.480]   because all of his friends were saying,
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480]   "Well, for sure it's your fault.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   "Stop denying it."
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.480]   He just kept suffering and suffering.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   And right now, we're thinking about this idea
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.480]   that when you experience suffering,
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.480]   can you trust God to such a degree
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480]   where you know he's sovereign,
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.480]   but what's more, you know that you can experience his love
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   and find future joy
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   because you know what God's gonna do with you?
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.480]   Does Job know all of that in the Old Testament?
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.480]   Well, take a moment to read this passage.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.480]   Job replies, "Even today, my complaint is rebellion.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   "His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   "Oh, that I knew where I might find him,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   "that I might come to his seat.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   "I would present my case before him
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.480]   "and fill my mouth with arguments.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.480]   "I would learn the words which he would answer
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.480]   "and perceive what he would say to me.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.480]   "Would he contend with me by the greatness of his power?
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.480]   "No, surely he would pay attention to me.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.480]   "There the upright would reason with him,
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.480]   "and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.480]   "Behold, I go forward, but he is not there,
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   "and backward, but I cannot perceive him.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.480]   "When he acts on the left, I cannot behold him.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.480]   "He turns on the right, and I cannot see him."
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   Take a moment to pause there.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480]   I reviewed his suffering,
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.480]   but I want to highlight a different kind of suffering
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.480]   that I'm sure some of you have experienced
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   and have counseled individuals who say,
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.480]   "This is the hardest part."
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   The pain when you tried crying out
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.480]   and you felt like there was silence
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.480]   and no word from God, right?
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.480]   Job understands.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.480]   Your Savior understands.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.480]   Yes?
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   He says, "Okay."
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   It's interesting that he says,
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.480]   "Yes, his hand is heavy upon me,"
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   but the bulk of his complaint is,
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.480]   "But I don't see what he's doing,
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   "and when I ask him, he didn't say."
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.480]   But the amazing part about this text
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.480]   is that Job believes,
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.480]   "But if I were able to talk to him,
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   "would he just crush me?
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   "Would he just demolish me and contend with me?"
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   He says, "No, he would tend to me."
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   Job believes in the kind-heartedness of God,
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.480]   and then look at this, verse 10.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   Job 23, verse 10.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   Take this to heart.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.480]   He says, "But he knows the way I take,
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.480]   "and when he has tried me,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   "I shall come forth like gold."
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.480]   How beautiful is that?
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   He knows what God is doing,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   but he really doesn't know.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   But then he knows.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   All the suffering that I've been through,
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   yes, I can't see what he's doing on my right and my left,
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   but I know God knows me.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   And when he's done putting me to the test
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   and he's approving me,
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.480]   then I'm going to be purified.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.480]   Then all the dross, all the dirt,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   all the impurities of the metal,
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.480]   he's going to refine.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.480]   Yes, in the furnace it's going to be so painful,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.480]   but God will deliver me.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.480]   And this is so beautiful, you guys.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   And in this way, I pray that for us,
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   we know the whole world suffers.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.480]   Non-Christians suffer.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.480]   There are some horrendous stories sometimes you read,
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   and you can't help but be in pain
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.480]   and ache for the people who have experienced so much loss.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.480]   But for us as a Christian,
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.480]   we know truly that there is joy
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.480]   because of the love we feel
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.480]   and the experience of the hand of God
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   as he is working in our lives.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   And therefore, I want to say to you as point three,
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   in the response and the expectation
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.480]   of what is to be our reaction to suffering,
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   is that God desires for us to have
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.480]   a willing and submissive spirit.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   The Lord is regularly asking us,
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.480]   "I know you want to follow Jesus,
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   "but to what degree?
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   "If you say, 'I want to follow Christ,'
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   "to which steps?"
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480]   Because every step in which Christ walked
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   was suffering, was sacrifice, was giving, serving.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   Can you continue to give and give and give
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.480]   in the midst of your heartache and pain?
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Are you going to demand, like,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   "God, I want to follow, but I want to make sure
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   "that my time is manageable,
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   "I have my rest days, I have my introverted moments
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   "of when I have time to myself,
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   "and I don't want certain kinds of people."
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   Do you have parameters, conditions, and demands?
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   Or do you have a willing and submissive spirit?
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.480]   "Lord, I want to follow
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.480]   "and take the steps you have for me.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   "But I know that it will require endurance."
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   You see, in James 1, verse 4,
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.480]   the scripture says,
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   "And let endurance have its perfect result."
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.480]   Expecting you to have a submissive spirit
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   so that God would allow,
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   that you would allow God to have
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.480]   His effect on your life through that hardship.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   Are we gonna say, "No, no, God, this can't be.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   "You were supposed to be there for me.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.480]   "You were to make sure this wasn't supposed to happen."
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   Or would you say, "God, as painful as it is."
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.480]   And you're allowed to ask,
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.480]   "Is there some way around this?"
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.480]   But that you're willing, submissive.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.480]   And sometimes we can know whether we have
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.480]   a submissive spirit or we don't,
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.480]   because we can see various things come out of us.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   And I realize, I'm reading James in a different way.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   I used to think, like, James is a book
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.480]   about tests of your faith.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   You know, weak faith that has no works is dead.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.480]   Test one, you're supposed to not be so quick to anger.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Test two, you're supposed to watch over your mouth.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.480]   But I realize, in the theme of suffering,
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   what are the ways in which we are unwilling to suffer?
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   Typically, first and foremost, we react in anger.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   You know, anger, I've said many times,
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   is a control tool for you to get a grip
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   either on people or their circumstance.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   Now, there are moments and times when we exhibit
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.480]   righteous indignation or we're upset about the situation,
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480]   and it's not as though every outburst of anger
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.480]   is just rot sinful.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.480]   But if we're suffering and our natural reaction is just,
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.480]   "No, no," and we're just angry about the situation,
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   we need greater endurance and a willing spirit.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   What's more, the book of James has much to say
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   about your tongue, and I realize when we suffer,
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   we get squeezed.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   It is the wine press.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480]   It is the test.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.480]   And what comes out are words of bitterness,
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:12.480]   great, great bitterness, hurtful words, critical words.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   And so in the book of James, it says,
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   "Is your mouth filled with curses and witness,
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480]   "and sore?
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.480]   "Are you exercising spirit control of your tongue
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.480]   "because you can entrust yourself to God?"
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.480]   Now, obviously, the passage and the challenge for us
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.480]   is to make sure that ultimately,
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.480]   we just don't give in and don't give up.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   And I believe that's why the book of James
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.480]   has so much to say about make sure
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   that you don't just hear, but you do.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   Because the heart that's discouraged by suffering
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   is like, "I already tried.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   "What's the use?
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   "I'm still going to suffer."
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   It's not working, right?
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   For those of you guys who are experiencing
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.480]   incredible heartache and pain within your family,
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.480]   and you have said like, "This so-and-so person,
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.480]   "my brother, my sister, my parent, my child, hopeless.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   "I've already tried it.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.480]   "Just fight, fight, fight.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   "Conflict, conflict, conflict."
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   And you lose the hope to continue.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:13.480]   I think this is why this book is so full with exhortation.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.480]   Do not give up obeying the Lord.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   Do not give up heeding his word.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   And that's why your faith will need
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.480]   to continue to exhibit itself.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480]   Because in the midst of suffering,
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   you can be so discouraged.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   If God is not so concerned
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   with the outcome of your circumstance,
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   but God is so concerned with the character
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   that you develop, you can persevere.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   And that's why even in 1 Peter 2,
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   it tells servants, "Be submissive to your masters
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   "with all respect,
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   "not only to those who are good and gentle,
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.480]   "but also to those who are unreasonable.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   "For this finds favor,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   "if for the sake of conscience towards God,
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   "a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly."
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.480]   Did you catch that?
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.480]   We are so fixated on fixing the circumstantial problem.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   God delights in producing in you glory.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.480]   God delights in producing in you
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   a kind of faith that perseveres
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.480]   and is not reasonable.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   When you love somebody who is your enemy,
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   it is not reasonable because it's so hard.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   But when you love beyond your capacity
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.480]   and beyond rationale and beyond what makes sense
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.480]   to your self-preserving, logical mind,
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   you glorify Christ in the same exact way
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   when you suffer unjustly
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.480]   and you bear under hardship
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.480]   beyond what you're capable,
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480]   beyond what's rational,
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.480]   and what seems to be in your estimation,
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   you glorify God. Amen?
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   So I want to encourage and challenge you guys
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.480]   that God is doing such a work.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   I don't know what all suffering you're experiencing,
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   but the Lord is giving you something so valuable
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   beyond money to help with your problems,
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.480]   beyond health to help with your pains.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   God is testing you.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   God is bringing endurance.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.480]   And 1 Peter 1, verse 6 says this,
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.480]   "In this you greatly rejoice,
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.480]   "even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   "you have been distressed by various trials,
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   "so that the proof of your faith
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   "being more precious than gold, which is perishable,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.480]   "even though tested by fire,
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   "may be found to result in praise, glory, honor
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.480]   "at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   "And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.480]   "And though you do not see him now, but you believe in him,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   "you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   "and full of glory,
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   "obtaining as the outcome of your faith
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.480]   "the salvation of your souls."
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.480]   Amen.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.480]   God is giving you something so much more valuable
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.480]   than money, power, health,
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.480]   and a life free of pain.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.480]   God is giving to you a proven faith.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.480]   God is giving to you the glories of Christ.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   Let's pray.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   Heavenly Father,
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   we thank you so much
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.480]   that even in the midst of circumstances and situations
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   that seem so difficult and also are confusing,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.480]   you make sense of it because we know
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   that we can trust your wisdom,
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.480]   we can trust your sovereign hand,
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   we can trust the intent of your heart,
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.480]   and we know what you're doing because you've told us.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.480]   We thank you, God,
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.480]   that we do not live this life aimlessly or purposelessly,
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.480]   but, God, we have this goal
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.480]   to know you and love you
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.480]   and to experience you.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.480]   We recognize that that path involves so much heartache,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.480]   but, God, nevertheless, thank you.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.480]   Thank you, God, that you do not leave us on our own.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   Thank you, God, that you treat us like your children
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   and just like every child needs to be both weaned,
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.480]   every child needs to be disciplined,
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   but also every child needs to be trained in righteousness.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.480]   Thank you, God, that you do that for us.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   We praise you, Lord, this day.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.480]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   Let us all rise for our closing praise.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   [music]
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.480]   Christ is sure.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.480]   Christ is sure in steady anchor
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.480]   In the fury of the storm
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.480]   When the winds of doubt blow through me
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   And my sails have all been torn
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.480]   In the suffering and the sorrow
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   When my sinking ropes are few
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   It shall never be removed
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:40.480]   Christ is sure.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.480]   Christ is sure in steady anchor
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   When the tempest rages on
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.480]   When temptation claims the battle
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   And it sees the night as one
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   Deeper still than goes the anchor
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   Though I justly stand accused
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   It shall never be removed
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   Christ is sure in steady anchor
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:36.480]   Through the floods of unbelief
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   Hopeless somehow, oh my soul now
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   I will rise to Calvary
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   This my ballast of assurance
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   Seen as love forever proved
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   It shall never be removed
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   [music]
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   Christ is sure in steady anchor
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.480]   As we face the wave of death
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   When these trials give way to glory
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.480]   As we draw our final breath
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   We will cross that great horizon
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   Clouds behind and life secure
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   And the calm will be the batter
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   For the storms that we endure
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.480]   Christ the sure of our salvation
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   Ever faithful, ever true
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   We will hold fast to the anchor
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   It shall never be removed
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:17.480]   Amen. Let's pray together.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   Our God, we again want to praise you
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   that you have given to us incredible hope
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   that is unshaken by the circumstances of this world.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.480]   You give us this hope in Christ,
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   who was never deterred, who never wavered,
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   but his face was set to his suffering,
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   but also he accomplished everything
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.480]   that he set out to do for salvation.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.480]   Thank you, God, that you are the true strong tower
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   in the midst of our storms and in the midst of our suffering.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   Thank you once more, God, that in all of this
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.480]   you say that you are able to come to our help
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   because you can sympathize with our weakness.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.480]   We pray, Father God, that you will continue to be merciful to us
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   and we thank you truly for the work that you are doing
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.480]   to build us up to the stature of Christ.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.480]   Now, to him who was able to keep you from stumbling
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.480]   blameless and with great joy.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   To the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.480]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   before all time and now and forever. Amen.
