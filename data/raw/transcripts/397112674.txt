[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We are on our second teaching session on this topic of...
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I had a moment where I was like searching, searching, searching.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And I see it as a problem.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   The question is how do we make faith to God through it?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   How do we solve often times, wrestling through moments of our lives where life is very much around?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Now, what I'd like you to do is turn back in your Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 8.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And then, once you're there...
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We're going to take a look at the tail end of that chapter.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We read portions of it. We saw how God was warning them.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Look, in this journey as you walk with me, there are going to be moments when your perspective is way off.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And in your arrogance, you're going to think, "Oh, I do this."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Or, in your easily distracted, easily swayed mind and heart, you're going to want other things.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   You're going to forget.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Within that, you're going to challenge and admonish them and say, "I am building you up for your good."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The discomforts, the stress, the feeling of not having enough.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Where are we going? What is all this?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I did this purposely, God said.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Now, what's very interesting about this is...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Please turn to the bottom.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Verse 18-20.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And God gives a very sobering statement.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 18.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He says, "But you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who has given you power to take wealth.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   That He may confirm this covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I testify against you today, you will surely perish.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And the nations that the Lord makes perish before you, so you shall perish.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Because you would not listen to the voice of the Lord your God."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Father, we do pray that you grant to us wisdom.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Father, would you grant to me clarity of speech.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Because the topic that we're about to address right now is massive.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I hope to convince it, God, in a way that is not necessarily palatable, but however understandable.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And I pray, Father God, all the more, God, that through understanding a worldview,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   through understanding a perspective that is appropriate to you,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   would we, Father God, then have the power to overcome momentary difficulties in our lives.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   We thank you, it's in Christ that we pray. Amen.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Okay.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So, by way of review, we talked about the various descriptions of the grind,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   of the difficulties that we experience, and you guys talked about them.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Then, we remember that these moments are not just haphazard moments where,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   yes, things are difficult, but that's not all it is.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   For example, the nation of Israel, they were in the most difficult of circumstances.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Namely, they were dying at the hands of the Egyptians.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   They were being treated as property, thrown into building projects.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Their bones and bodies helped support the structures that the Egyptians built.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They were oppressed.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   That is a real life scenario.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Somebody asked me over the break, "Hmm, is it wrong to ever then even mention the difficulties we experience?"
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Because, obviously, I don't want to complain about them, so do I even mention it?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And the fact of the matter is, yes. Why? Because they're realities. Right?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But the thing we don't want to do is use them for excuses why we quit.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We don't want to use them for purposes of running away, hiding, whatever it may be.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Purposes of turning to our own devices.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   We are desiring to grow from these as God intended it, which is to build us.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   These are tests to build. That's what we talked about. Right?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But one of the things that we left off with is the thought that these tests then have results.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And typically, even if we take exams, we don't always get 100%.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Even if you got a 90%, that means there's 10% you don't know and you got wrong.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   My challenge was, are you so convicted that you want to grow, that then, yes, I want to grow the 10% I missed. Right?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And I sit there celebrating, "Woo! 90%!" Right?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You got to think, "How can I grow to 10?"
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   That was a challenge from the last time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Now, what I'm going to say then is reiterating or jumping off from that, moving forward from that,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   the problem with these difficult circumstances in our lives, and isn't so much difficult circumstances,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   because you won't have them here for until you die.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Do you think retired people don't go through a grind?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Oh, yes, they do.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I mean, it's strange, but I'm now sometimes sitting down with older individuals,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   trying to counsel them through loneliness, counsel them through physical ailments,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   counsel them through how do you persevere and stay faithful when your body keeps giving up.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And the pain and agony of just the everyday chores become to you a literal grinding.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah? Okay.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   In thinking through that then, the problem in the midst of our struggles isn't just the struggle in and of itself,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   but the problem in our weakness.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Here, this afternoon, what we're going to focus on is this, my purpose statement,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   the main structural statement I have for you is this.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The problem of the grind is your lack of motivation and your wrong interpretation that allowed it.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You have to get the whole thing. Are you ready?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The problem of the grind is your lack of motivation and your wrong interpretation that allowed it.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And all of that is very important.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   There is a connection between what you are motivated by, okay?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So you have motives in your life that make you do what you do.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   A motive brought you here to this retreat, okay?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   As far as it was, some of you guys drove three, four hours.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   As tiring as you knew it would be, as cold as it, you know?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Some of you guys are very allergic to cold.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   As cold as it may be, you had a motive to come.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Everything you are doing in life, there's a motive.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Even the strange vices we have in our lives, certain addictions people have in their lives, there is a motive.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And behind that motive is an interpretation of your reality that allows it,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   that makes you believe it's good enough to do.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That make sense?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That is a worldview.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It encapsulates the big drives in your life that cause you to do what you do,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and the beliefs in your lives that allows for it to happen.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Now, moving forward then, here.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   The problem is not so much than the grind, but your weak motives, okay?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Your lack of motive.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's the first point, major point.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   What are we talking about here?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Listen, we talked about the various things that are really bad, okay?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And that's fine, because those can be all states of reality.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You may have a boss who literally knows a lot less than you.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And that could be an objective truth.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Fine.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   You may have difficult circumstances in your lives that are genuinely stressful.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I have heard from some of you guys that yes, you've been sleeping at the office,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   or that some of you guys go in, you don't come out, and you're like,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   "I didn't see the daylight today."
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know? You're just sad, okay?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Fair. Fair enough.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   However, even then, there's still a motive for you to go into the office next day.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Yes?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Now, within this, while you are going through these grinds and struggles of your life,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   God is challenging you to question, to evaluate, and see your motive to be faithful to Him.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Yes?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So what's happening?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Within the context of a certain snapshot of your reality--
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   and I'm kind of getting a little bit like talking about reality, motives, interpretations,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'm getting a little philosophical here.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Very conceptually, yes.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But it's all important, okay?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Because it's all right there in your head, all right?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Now listen.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   What you realize then is there are competing motives in your mind.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Some of them are small, and some of them are huge.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Do you realize that?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Yes?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   At any given snapshot moment in your life, as you go through difficulties,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and as you're struggling to do what God is calling you to do,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   there are competing motives.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And what God is trying to do through these tests,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   what chapter 8 clearly taught you,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   was God was trying to make sure you understand and you keep a pulse.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Not God, because He knows.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yes, He says, "I'm going to see," but God already knew.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   As a matter of fact, you read the whole book of Deuteronomy,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   they're having an object lesson.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's kind of like this.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   They're having a powwow.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   They're having a service, and God is teaching the nation,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   "Heads up, I need to teach you this, because I know what you struggle with."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And He says, "Let me show you, you need to have a heart pulse
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   on your motivation to be faithful to Me.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Will you obey Me?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I want you to take a moment to think about that.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Within the various contexts of your striving, your grind,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   and things like that, do you currently have a pulse?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   How strong is my motive to follow, prioritize, and obey my God?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   How strong is my motive, my dedication, and desire,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   the simple question of what do you want?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   How strong is that?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   How strong is your desire to serve my God, my Lord and Master?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   You've got to take a moment to meditate on that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And I'm assuming, I am assuming that the nation of Israel
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   stood before Moses and said, "We're good.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Of course we'll obey.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   We're headed into the Promised Land."
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That's happened so many times.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Do you recall the history, Joshua chapter 24?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   The famous, famous passage where Joshua says,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "Choose for yourself this day whom you will serve.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   If it seems good to you to serve the gods of the Amorites
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and the Amalekites, then do it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But if you think that it is good to serve the God of Israel,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   then put it all aside."
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Do you guys remember what the people said?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "We'll do it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Far be it from us that we should ever serve the gods
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   of the Amalekites."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Like, "But you just did."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   It was really bad.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But the people said, "Far be it from us.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Of course we'll serve God."
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And then Joshua said, "Will you really?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Will you?"
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Seriously, look that up on the passage later
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   when you get a chance.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And the people said, "You're my witness.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   You're my witness.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Joshua, you're our witness.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Let our children be witness.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   We will serve God.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   We'll do it."
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And then the next chapter--
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   you know how it goes.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   You know how it goes from there.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's because I am trying to show us
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   if we are honest with ourselves, that right there,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   our motive to be faithful to God is regularly tested,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   regularly tempted, and constantly attacked.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And if we're very honest, if I'm very honest,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and I'm being very honest with you,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   that motive is so shaky.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I know I'm a pastor, but let me be honest with you right now.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   There have been days where I'm sitting just tired,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and then I end the day, and so I go,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   "Hey, I'm just going to turn off my brain
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and go peruse the interweb, you know, interweb,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   for stuff, materials."
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I go on Slick Deals.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   You guys do that?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Kill your time on Slick Deals?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I do.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And then you do that stuff, and the next thing you know,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   the next time you browse the web,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   those products show up on your website,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   like all the advertisements and stuff.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   One time, I did that.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   My mistake.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Just kidding.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   That was in my heart.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I looked at trucks, okay?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I was looking at trucks and cars and stuff like that.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I'm just going to confess to you openly right now
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   what happened, okay?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I sat there, and I was looking at this truck.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It was beautiful.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It had everything I wanted.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It was a 4x4 off-road Tacoma, crew cab.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Of course, you got to take the whole family with you.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Long bed because you got to haul stuff.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It had a roof rack, running boards.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It had this thing called the Pro Grille,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   special grill, and beefy tires, right?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I said, "Dang!"
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   The price on that thing was ridiculous.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And I went, "No!"
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Okay.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   That moment right there, my motive for life was tested.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   No joke.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   This is how weak my heart is.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I started thinking, "You know what I could do
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   is I could probably make some money doing X, Y, and Z.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   If I could make $300 per month,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I could totally buy this car."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm just being completely honest with you.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   That was my break, right?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   The thing about it is, you guys know,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I have no time in my life right now.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I barely sleep, right?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   What am I going to do with a side job,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   side hustle, than making $300 a month?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   But I was thinking that.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   As soon as I started thinking that, I was like,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   "Stupid! I would have to work so hard
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   to make $300 a month.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   If I just did this, I would make this much money."
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   My career choice was on the line in that moment.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   No joke.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And the next thing I knew, I started thinking,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I started wishing, because you guys know,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   I've confessed many times that I love working on cars.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Right now, one of my cars, I wanted to do this thing.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I bought the pieces.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I never got to work on it.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   There was this little desire in my heart.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   If I had a different profession,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I would have weekends to work on my car.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And then later, I don't know what I was thinking,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   it just started rolling in my head.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It just started rolling in my head.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I had to walk over to Bia, and I was like,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   "Dude, Bia, there's like, idolatry in my mind.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And it's so mean, because it's a car."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It's so crazy.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   It was dictating my life choices.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It was dictating my fantasy.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   It was dictating, potentially thinking,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   "What if I had a different profession in life?"
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You guys know, I would, I love being a pastor.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I love counseling.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I would do it all day.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   But just that one moment gripped my arm,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   and my motive was lost.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Okay, I'm pretty sure you guys can relate to that.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Now, within all this, within all this,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I believe, it's not moments of intense persecution,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   like, you know, "Those pagans are after us,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and now my motives are being shaken."
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   No, no, no.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   It's actually in the numbness of the grind of your lives.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's actually in the kind of monotonous, purposeless,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   what seems to be purpose-living,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   where your desires are inspired for other stuff.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Right?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's especially when you're frustrated at your work,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and you want that other job, and you want that other stuff,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   where those inspirations pop up on your feet, mentally.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And all of a sudden, you can entertain and picture
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   your life going that way.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And now you live in fantasy land, like,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   "God, if you could somehow snap your magical finger
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and give me this alternate universe where I could be there."
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Now your heart is set.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   But God is challenging you.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   "Can you still be faithful to me here?"
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Because that's what I've called you to do.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I have called you to be faithful to me here and now
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   in the desert, when you're hungry,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   when all you have is one pair of clothes.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You've got nothing but your family and your community with you.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   "Can you be faithful to me, or do I have to magically
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   snap my finger and put you there in order for you to love me
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and to listen to what I say?"
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   That's a huge convicting question, right?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And that's a challenge to us.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Why?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Because sometimes, in our complaining and griping
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   about our wilderness now, our grind right now,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   we will say, "But look!
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   All we have is this.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   We barely have anything!"
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But let me challenge you now.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   The other night, I asked you guys to compare with each other
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   who has the greatest number in terms of score of fatigue.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And you guys are sharing with each other,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   "I'm a 5, I'm a 6," and whatever, right?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And then you guys have been kind of following this trail
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   that I've been saying sometimes what we do
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   in our young adult work life and stuff like that,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   is we compare our work lives and then we compete
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   who has it the worst, right?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And when we do that, though, sometimes the danger is
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   it's okay.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   It's okay that you guys talk about your hardships.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Because actually, I love it when you guys are able
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   to minister to each other through your hardships, right?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   If you feel weak, you should be able to ask for help.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   If you feel like you're not really striving after the Lord,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   you should reveal, "These are the things that are hard for me,"
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and you need encouragement, okay?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But then the danger on the other side is
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   you use these as excuses why it makes sense
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   that you're not striving, right?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   However, there are people who would win.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Who would win in the game, in the competition,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   of who has it the worst.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And who is that?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Christian slaves.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The nation of Israel are slave people.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   If there are people who have an excuse
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   to act up a little bit,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   to maybe enjoy the freedoms that they just recently earned,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   to maybe do stuff that they never got to do before,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   we were deprived, man.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Some of these Israelites knew nothing but slavery.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They were there 400 years.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   They knew nothing but slavery.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I want you to think about that.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   If you ever find yourself keep pointing at your circumstance
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   as the excuse why you're not growing as you should
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and you're not as mature as you should be,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   you lose to the Christian slave.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Because even in the New Testament,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   God expected slaves to be faithful,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   growing, mature.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Some of you guys I've talked to,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   yeah, you just straight up say,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   "Because of the stuff that has happened in my life,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I'm not where I should be."
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I get that on a human level.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   God challenges you to more.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   He challenges you to more.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Turn in your Bibles with me to Ephesians 6, verse 5.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Ephesians 6, verse 5.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   [pause]
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Did I say that out loud?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Oh, no.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   It's because when I look down,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   sometimes I have seven pages of notes.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   After 20 minutes, I'm only through one page.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, no."
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Because if you do the math on that,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   20 minutes per page is not good for you.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   All right.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   We'll get through this.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Okay?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Okay.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Ephesians 6, verse 5.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Look at this.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's crazy.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   If you ever meditate on this stuff,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   it's crazy.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Slaves, obey your earthly masters
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   with fear and trembling,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   with a sincere heart, as you would Christ.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Meditate on that, guys.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   What kind of incredible strength
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   does a slave need to obey his earthly master
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   with fear and trembling as to Christ?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   For those of you who are working right now
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   with horrible bosses
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   who know nothing of what maturity means,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   some of you guys have bosses who are vulgar.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Right?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Have you guys ever worked under people like that?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   I have.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's awkward.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   They act like children.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Their mouths are vulgar.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Their mentality is childish.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   I literally don't understand
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   how they got to the position they were in.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   What is the Christian call?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Seriously, right?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   With meekness, with fear, with respect, then,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   with a sincere heart like you really, really want to,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   as though the person
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   who has the character of Christ
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   to obey in that manner?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Let me pose it in another way.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I asked this question.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   What kind of strength does this slave need
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   this Christian slave
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   to obey his earthly master?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Put it in another way.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   What would motivate this person
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   to endure that grind?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Think about it.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   What would motivate this Christian slave
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   to endure that grind?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Is there a promise?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Do it for five years, and it's glory!
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Freedom!
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   No, there is no promise
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   of any kind of temporary kind of power.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   There is no temporary kind of freedom up ahead.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   There is no silver lining.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   There is nothing said right there.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Except this is the expectation of God upon you.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Now, turn to another passage.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   1 Peter 2, verses 18-20.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   1 Peter 2, verses 18-20.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Another passage written to servants.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   The term there means slave again.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Servants, be submissive to your masters
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   with all respect,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   not only to those who are good and gentle,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   but also to those who are unreasonable.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   What?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   He just flat out says it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You need to be submissive to all.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Oh, man.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's crazy.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   But, but, but, but, that pause.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   So annoying.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Okay, you cannot point at the circumstance
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   because God has higher expectations of you.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   But take a look at verse 19.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   This finds favor.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   You better highlight that.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   The reason why I want you to do this
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   is because this finds favor.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   The cause of your submitting to an ungodly individual
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   is because this finds favor.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   If for the sake of conscience toward God,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   a person bears up under sorrows
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   when suffering unjustly,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   for what credit is there if,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   when you sin and they're harshly treated,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   you endure it with patience,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   but if when you do what is right and suffer for it,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   you patiently endure it,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   this finds favor with God.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Notice how this finds favor is written twice.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Important, emphatic for you and me.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Right?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He is saying to you,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   if everything makes sense humanly,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   your boss is lovely and wonderful,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   there's appreciation work day on every Friday of the week,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   they let you do what you want,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   they give you freedom,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   nobody supervises you,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   nobody's hunting you,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   no, like, you know, hovering over your shoulders,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   they lift you up, pay you well,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and you're happy there,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   totally makes sense.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But guess what?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   If that's the case,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   then God is hidden.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   However, however,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   if you're being mistreated,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   work is tough,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   doesn't even make sense that you're there,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   they're kind of totally taking advantage of you,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   but you're holding up for righteousness,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   you're holding your character,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   you serve with joy,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   you're submissive to people that doesn't make sense to be submissive for,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   now there's a question, why?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   What are you doing?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   That's when you get to answer and give your reason,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   because I have a God,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   because I have a master in heaven,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   this is to you your light,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   this is to you your great testimony,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   that's how it happens,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   you get to tell people your motivation.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And so, the motivation,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   this is a major point here,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   what is the motivation?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   If earlier, this long, long, drawn out point that I've given you was,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   the fault in our circumstance is not just the hardships,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   the fault in our circumstance is your faulty motive,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   your weak motive,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   your fickle motives, right?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Then what must be the motive that stands the test of time?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   What must be the motive that stands a year, two, three, four, five years of hardship?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I want to make sure that every Christian that are in our midst,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   understanding these parts of scriptures,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   would be those who even after 40 years of the desert,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   would have strong motive to be faithful to God, right?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   That's what we need,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   because the vast majority of you in here,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   you're going to be working for the next 30, 40 years.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   So, as we think about this,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   as we think about motivation and what it means,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   we have to understand how important it is that for us,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   we have to interpret and see appropriately,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   the same kind of motive that is driving this Christian slave,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   to go obey his unreasonable master.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   It comes down to, for the sake of God.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I desire, and have this incredible ambition in my heart,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   to please my heavenly master.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Now, is that the first time you guys have ever heard that?
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Probably not.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Let me ask you a question though.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   When was the last time you verbally said it?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   When was the last time you moved yourself by that motive,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and said, "I am here now doing what I'm doing,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   because I have my great ambition to please God."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   If you go through your Bibles over to 2 Corinthians 5,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   there's an important passage that summarizes that.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   2 Corinthians 5, verse 9.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   (Pause)
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Look at this.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   It says, "Therefore, we have as our ambition,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   whether at home or outside, to be pleasing to Him,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   so that each one may be recompensed for his deed in the body,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   This is the operating understanding.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   This is the operating worldview by which the Christian slave is saying,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   "I'm going to still do it."
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Why?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Because I am placing trust in the fact that when I do this,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I please my God.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Now, in as much as I want to pound this pulpit
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and try to drive this point home,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   please understand that I am, again, really hoping that we understand this.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   For me, as a pastor, sometimes it's great,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   because when I'm counseling individuals,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   when I'm preparing sermons,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   for me, one of the great privileges of being a pastor is,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I can see how this has a connect with God.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Alright, now, think with me here and meditate, okay?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   This idea for us, thinking about what is,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   like, why is motivation so important?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And why is it so important for us to not only have this great ambition to please the Lord,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   to have this in the Scriptures, to have this in our notes,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and have this on our walls, but to have it in your heart.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Why is it so important?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   We know why it's so important.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Because we've seen ourselves drag our feet.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   We've seen ourselves be slow to do the things that we want to do.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And you guys know what that looks like.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   You know when you're not motivated to study.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You know when you're not motivated to work.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   You know how sometimes, some days, it takes like four hours to send four emails.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   You could have done it in like ten minutes, right?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   For those of you guys who are studying, I know, I've seen you guys when you're not motivated to study.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You read a page, you finish a whole bag of chips.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   You read another page, you go talk to your friends.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Like, that's just how it is, right?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Okay.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Now is that why, you know, why it's so important to think about going to church?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   No, I don't think so.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   The reason why is because our Christian life is all about faith.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   What we are doing is operating by what we believe.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So here and now is a big conceptual thing that I had to do,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   and I want to walk you through it, okay?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Alright.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Listen carefully to this part, okay?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Right now, I just made a big push saying your motivation should be to please the Lord.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You get that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Question.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Why is that so hard?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Question.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   What is the biggest stumbling block in order for you to get there?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Question.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   What is happening in your head that even for, again, earlier I gave you my confession.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I gave my life to serve my God.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I was ordained by this church.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I studied, like, years and years and years to get to this position.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Why would it be so easy for me to let go of that from one small material object?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   What in the world is happening in my head?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Okay.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I had to sit there and just wrestle.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   God, show me what happened in my mind.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Okay.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   This is where I want to be helpful.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   My next major point to you is going to be this.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Remember at the proposition I said there is a worldview, there is a mentality, there
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   is an interpretation that allows for your motivation to be weak.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Right?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Let me tell you something.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You will be only motivated by that which is pleasing to you.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Okay.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   You only want the stuff you like.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Wow.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Big novel thought.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   The thing about it though is it's so true.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Okay.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   We are not going to stick out our hand and do something that we think is going to be
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   to us an evil or painful.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   We are only going to go and grab that which we think is going to be good.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It is our interpretation of what is good that is going to cause us to actually be motivated
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   by it.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Okay.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Think about this.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I am going to talk about pornography.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Okay.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Every single individual in this room knows that it is a vice, it is sinful, it is ultimately
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   going to wreck people's lives, it is messing with your brain and yet so many people struggle
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   with it, both ladies and men.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Why?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Simple fact.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   It is very pleasing.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   That's it.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   It is pleasing to you and therefore it is yours.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   You do it, you grab it.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Now, I want you to take a moment to think about this.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Okay.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Alright.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Try to piece together a couple of thoughts.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Here I am saying your motivation comes from your interpretation that this thing is good.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So guess what?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   What you have to do is have this mentality where you are reinterpreting what is actually
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   good for you.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You have to wash your mind.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Your greatest sanctification is going to be for you to truly do a mind change about what
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   you believe is actually good and pleasing to you.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Yes?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Okay.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   So help us think about this.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   For us, we have just talked about how the nation of Israel were slaves.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Are we not?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Are we more civilized individuals?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Are we managers?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Are we CEOs?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Are we VPs and presidents of our companies?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   When in the world did we stop thinking that all of a sudden we weren't a slave?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Scripture is absolutely clear.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You and I are slaves of Christ.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It is an absolutely wrong, unsanctified thing for me to dictate my own good pleasure.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Yes?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   What needs to happen in the mind whenever we are hitting certain walls, what needs to happen
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   in the mind when we see weak motivations, what needs to happen in the mind when we see competing
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   motivations.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   If I'm looking at a truck and saying, "I want that so much that I'm going to now change
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   my course of path," it's not just easy for me to say, "Hey, I need to go put this away.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I need to go put this aside.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Stop staring at it."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   That's not enough.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   It's never going to be enough.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And if you, you're struggling with stuff, whether it be pornography, whether it be idols of
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   other stuff, whether it be idols of things like homes, whether it be idols of cars,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   whether it be idols of other jobs.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   You're not going to win by telling yourself, "See no evil, hear no evil."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   You're not going to win like that.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Why?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Because in your head, you've already deemed it to be good for you.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   That's all.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And we have to understand that we as slaves, our subjected, our humble position must be,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   "Lord, you dictate what is pleasing and good.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Lord, you determine what is glorious."
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And so therefore, you have to reinterpret everything that is good.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Are you only good and God honoring when you are the greatest version of yourself like
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   you have been taught all your lives?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Are you only glorifying God when you are being respected at work and you are promoting every
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   year and you're being appreciated as you go?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Will you not be glorifying God if you were a t-shirt seller for the rest of your life
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   for 30, 40 years?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Would you not be pleading unto the Lord if you were suffering, if you were mistreated?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Is that what the scripture says?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   No.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And yet, and yet for us, that is going to be some of the hardest things.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   So scripture says, I'm going to read to you 1 Peter chapter 1.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Why don't you turn there and read along with me?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   1 Peter chapter 2, verse 13 through 17.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   as the one in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and the praise of those who do right.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Act as free men and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as what?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   As a cover for evil.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.

[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.

[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.

[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.

[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   And if you are a slave of the Lord, do not use your freedom as a cover for evil.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Go in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 17-24.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Let me read that passage. 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 17-24.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   As you turn there, think about this. Does a slave have fears?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Think about it from a slave's perspective. Think about it from your perspective.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Is this going to be my life? Being the gopher for this ungodly man?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Is this going to be my value? Being the object of another human being?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   This could be for some their worst case scenario.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Think about your other fears. God is calling you to do things in your life that you have fears about whether you can do or not.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   I am not qualified for this. I don't have the skills for this.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   You have fears. Now take a look at this. 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 17-24.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And we should probably start to wrap things up a little bit.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Verse 17. "Only as the Lord has assigned to each one."
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Are you guys there? I can still hear some pages.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   "Only as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each in this manner, let him walk.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And so I direct in all the churches, was any man called when he was already circumcised?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   He is not to be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing. And uncircumcision is nothing.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   But what matters is the keeping of the commandments of God.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Each man must remain in the condition in which he was called.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Were you called while a slave?"
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I want you to highlight this. Do not worry about it.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   What in the world?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Next. "But if you are able to also be free, rather do that.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   For he who was called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's free man.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   You are a bond with the Christ. Do not become slaves of men.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Brethren, each one is to remain with God in that condition in which he was called."
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Someone's going to come up to me and be like, "Oh shoot. I just applied for another job.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Should I stay?"
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   If you can do it, just do it. It does not matter.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   If you have the freedom and the liberty to go get another higher paying job, just do it.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   That is not really what he is talking about, is it?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   He is talking about this fear.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He is talking about this fear.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I am going to be a slave for the rest of my life.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I am going to be a low level, entry job for the rest of my life.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   What is your fear?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I am going to be this for the rest of my life?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Is this all I am going to amount to?
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   The world might be like, "Is that all you amount to?"
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   You are like, "Shut up."
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   You have this fear.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Do not let that rule you.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   He straight up says, "Do not let it trouble you."
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   If you were a slave, if you said this outside the church walls, people would be like, "What?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   The Bible is dumb. The Bible is weird."
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Especially in this highly racialized culture even now, you bring this up like, "You know,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   you read this verse outside of our context, this sounds offensive.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   How do you dare tell a slave, 'Were you a slave?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Do not worry about it.'"
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   How do you say that?
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   You can only say that to a Christian.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   So for you and me, when we reinterpret our good and when we reinterpret our fears, you
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   know what we are doing?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   We are practicing our faith.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   We are practicing our trust.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I said to you earlier, this is so important.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It took me a long road to get here, but please listen up.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   So I am going to look around.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   If you are looking sleepy, I am going to call your name.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   Do not look sleepy because I am going to call your name.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   I am not sleepy right now.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Okay, listen up.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   The question was asked, "How do you remain faithful?"
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Define for me what is faith.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Faith is, God said it, I am putting it to the test and obeying it.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   That is faith.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   God said so.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Listen, you may be being mistreated right now, but when you exemplify the character
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   of Christ, I am so pleased in that.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   You better test that.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Is God pleased by that?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   He said He is, so I am going to do it.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   God has said, you may think that you are sitting in your room in the dark so alone, but He
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   says do not worry.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Do not worry because you are my free man.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Because you are my child.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   God said it, so I am not going to worry.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Your faith is taking God at His word and testing it to be true.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   When you are in the midst of your grind, and God tells you, do not worry, I will see you
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   through this grind.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   The results are in my hand.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   That is you exercising your faith.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Amen.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   That is what it comes down to for us, where we interpret.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   I am going to read for us again by way of conclusion, 1 Peter chapter 2.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Scripture says, servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   For this finds favor.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   If for the sake of conscience towards God a person bears up under sorrows with suffering
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   and unjustly, for what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated you endure
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   with patience, but if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   it, this finds favor with God.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Brothers and sisters, I am not telling you to fake happy when you are in the grind.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   We are challenging to a saying, stay on the course of being faithful to God.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Amen.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Let's pray.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Lord, we want to take a moment Father God to ask of you, Father to have grace upon us
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   that Lord you would truly motivate our hearts to long for you, to seek your good pleasure,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   to desire to be pleasing and to find favor with you.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Father God, in this day and age, even our Christian community has done us a disfavor
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   by saying that God there is nothing about you being either more pleased or less pleased
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   with us, but clearly Lord your scripture says that when we are enduring the grind, God this
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   pleases you.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   When we exhibit Christ like character through the grind, that God this glorifies you.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   And so I pray Father that God would put that to the test and Lord we would be found faithful.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Lord, I want to take a moment because I know there are some people who are struggling.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   They are struggling with discouragement.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   They are struggling Father God with their own weakness and I know many of us struggle
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   with our own fears of what we are becoming, but I pray Lord that you would provide your
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   holy presence, help us to see you in our picture, help us Father God to see you as the biggest
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   thing in our interpretation, help us Father God to see you as the most powerful thing,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   the most weighty, the most important thing, the greatest thing in all of our minds, so
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   that God you saturate everything that we are about.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   We thank you Lord Jesus Christ and we pray.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.840]   Amen.
