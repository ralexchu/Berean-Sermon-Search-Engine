[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   So the Women's Ministry is hosting a film-worship event, not this Saturday, but next Saturday.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.840]   And we are going to be watching a documentary on Corrie ten Boom.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.800]   And it's just such a powerful story of God's sovereignty through difficulties, risks that
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.880]   she took through her faith and forgiveness.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.480]   So we're going to have time in small groups to get to discuss the film and also get to
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.600]   know other sisters.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.440]   So everyone's welcome, college, singles, people that are married, and it would actually be
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.360]   a great opportunity to invite your unbelieving friends and family.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.560]   So the deadline is being extended until tomorrow, so please sign up.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   Thank you.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.880]   Also, as an important sign up, please sign up for our all-church picnic that's taking
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.240]   place on October 20th.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.160]   So today is the last day to sign up where we can guarantee T-shirts and different supplies
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.560]   and things like that.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.000]   So please be sure to sign up.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.600]   There's going to be a booth outside where you can sign up there or just go ahead and
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   use the link that's provided for you on your app and on the program.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.600]   And again, it's just $10 for the whole day, which includes the lunch, the shirt, and all
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600]   the activities.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.960]   And we hope to come together as church sister really fellowship together that day.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.040]   Also on October 19th, Saturday, there is an evangelism event that's taking place.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.160]   And what that means is we're going to be gathering together just individuals near Huntington
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.520]   Beach to do open air teaching and sharing of the gospel.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.460]   So if you'd like to participate, it's being coordinated by the family ministry, but it's
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.920]   open to all.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.920]   Please be sure to email June Yim directly and the email is there on the program for
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920]   you.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.840]   Just want to highlight one more thing, which is that for our band ministry, we have a car
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.720]   rally on November 2nd.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.400]   Our band ministry is our young adults ministry, and this is just an opportunity for us to
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.000]   get together and fellowship.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   So please use the link to sign up there.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Okay.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.840]   At this time, I'll invite Pastor Peter to come deliver the word of God.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.280]   All right.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.600]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter six, verses nine through 12.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.320]   Hebrews chapter six, verses nine through 12.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.600]   Hebrews chapter six, verses nine through 12.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.360]   Reading out of the NASV, "But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.640]   you and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.160]   For God is not unjust, so ask to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.340]   his name in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.600]   And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.200]   of hope until the end, so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.640]   faith and patience inherit the promises."
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   Let's pray.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.080]   Gracious Father, we have come corporately as a body, Lord God, to join our voices, join
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.280]   our time, our energy, Lord, to focus our attention on you and your word.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.840]   We pray, Father, for your Holy Spirit to guide and lead us.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.700]   Soften our hearts that we may be molded.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.440]   Open our ears, Lord, that we may be hearers.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800]   I pray that you would change us, Father God, according to your word, that we may be more
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.720]   than just hearers, but be doers of your word.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.640]   May Christ be exalted.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.720]   May our vision for his glory be specified, that our love for you may grow as a result.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.200]   So we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.920]   All right, as you know, the previous week's passage was probably one of the harshest and
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   the most clearest rebukes to the early church.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.920]   And I say it's one of them because it is not the most.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.720]   I would say most people would argue that this is the second most clear and second strongest
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.200]   rebuke to the church.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.360]   But the greater one is actually coming in chapter 10.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.120]   So this is actually preparation.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.040]   So if you've heard last week's sermon and you were kind of bothered by it, it's like,
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   man, this is too strong.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Right?
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   It was only a preparation.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.560]   That's to get you ready for what he's about to say in chapter 10.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.600]   Chapter 10, some of you guys may already know, is a text where Jonathan Edwards preaches
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.040]   this sermon, "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," and it's based on the text in Hebrews
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.880]   chapter 10.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.080]   But the purpose of this rebuke wasn't simply to get them to question their salvation.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.600]   That was not his ultimate goal.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.360]   It is to make sure that the hope that they have in Christ is not based upon wishful thinking.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.840]   We have a tendency, if we're not careful, that we can just kind of drift along and to
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.480]   just kind of, again, because of where we are in our generation, where Christianity is,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.600]   where we live, that a lot of people come into the church and stay in the church, and yet
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.360]   they've never had a covenant relationship with Christ.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.960]   You know, those of you who are dating, or maybe a lot of you who've dated in the past,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.920]   you know, we would all say that there are certain things that are deal breakers.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   Right?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.640]   If you go on a first date and they show up with sweatpants, that's a deal breaker.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.720]   They're not taking this seriously, or they wore slippers, or maybe he went out to eat,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   and if your lady, saying if he's unwilling to pay for the check, maybe that's a deal
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   breaker.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   Right?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.960]   So, there are certain things that you say, you know, he doesn't have a sense of humor,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.440]   or he treats his mom bad, or something.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   Right?
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.280]   You would look at that and say, these are deal breakers.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   But you can't bring in the deal breakers into a covenant relationship.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.720]   You can't say that in the marriage context.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   You can't say, you know what, I'm married to my wife or husband, but here's my deal
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   breaker.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   She burns my food too many times, or you know what I mean, or isn't sensitive to me, you
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.120]   know.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   You can't do it.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.600]   So, covenant relationship basically means, no matter what it is, it's meant to be permanent.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.080]   But the challenge that we have in the church, when it is mixed with wheat and the tares,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.600]   is that people enter into this covenant relationship with the same type of mentality.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.560]   Now, what is a deal breaker for a Christian?
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.600]   Is there anything that can happen in your life where if this happened, or if God doesn't
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.560]   provide this, or if I was in this kind of circumstance, or if I was tempted by this,
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.400]   I don't know if I would persevere in my faith.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.680]   Is there anything that you can think of that you say, this would be really difficult in
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   this context to continue to follow Christ?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   Well, if you put anything in that box, if you answer that with anything, that contradicts
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.360]   a covenant relationship with God.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   Some people have entered into the church because they were born into it.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.720]   Your parents were Christian, maybe your grandparents were Christian, and so you just naturally
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   assumed.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   So, if you happened to be born in a Buddhist family, you probably would have gone to the
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.760]   temple.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.040]   If you were born in an atheist family, maybe you would have been an atheist.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.220]   So naturally, because you were born in a Christian home, you were raised in the church, the easiest
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.640]   path for you to go was to continue in your faith.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.860]   Even though the scripture says, broad is the way that leads to destruction, narrow is the
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.880]   way that leads to eternal life, and very few would be found on it, but for you, the easiest
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.560]   path for you was to just continue down the path that you were on.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.960]   So being in the church for those people was the easy path.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.840]   It was the broad path.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   And many are on that, not because they are genuinely following Christ, but because that
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.720]   was the easiest path.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.320]   Some have come to Christ because they were desperate at some point.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.920]   There was some tragedy that happened, maybe you were sick and you cried out to God and
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.040]   you felt like God was there, or there were some Christians that came into your life that
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.760]   gave you support and said, "You know what?
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.000]   I'm really so thankful for these Christians."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.080]   And so in desperation, you cried out to God, and for that moment, you gave your life to
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.760]   Christ, but now the crisis is no longer there.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.800]   There's no sense of urgency to go to Christ.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   So as a result, only when you have emergency, only when you are desperate do you need Christ.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.760]   In every other period of your life, whether he's there or not, whether you pray or not,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.440]   whether you live in obedience or not, it's just not that important.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.640]   And so you may find yourself drifting, but because there's nothing desperate in your
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.120]   life, you don't see an urgency to take heed of these warnings.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.640]   Some came to Christ because they were enamored with the church community.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   These people, they're such good people, especially in our society where community is breaking
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.200]   down, even the family structure, even at work.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.440]   Everybody's just working in their cubicles, come home, they're on their phone.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.200]   And so you find a community of people that you really click with, similar interests and
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   hobbies.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.080]   And so maybe you came into church for those reasons.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.960]   You were in college, you were lost, you found some campus ministry that you felt like you
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.560]   belonged to, and then that just continued on until some of these relationships begin
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.360]   to break down and people disappoint you, and then all of a sudden, you find yourself drifting
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   away from God because your connection to Christ was all about connection to other friends.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.560]   And then there's some people who came into the church just to give it a try.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.200]   Because what have you got to lose?
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.320]   You get to come to church filled with nice people.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.440]   My kids get taught good morals, VBS, and they just gave it a try.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.320]   But inwardly, there is no true faith.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.280]   And as a result of that, you'll jump through the minimum requirement that that community
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.320]   requires, but because there's no genuine faith, it never moves beyond the minimum.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.680]   As long as my children are taken care of, my friendships are going well, and I feel
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   a sense of purpose in life, that is enough.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.480]   When the Bible talks about picking up your cross, it's a foreign concept.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.560]   It's just certain things that apostles, maybe pastors, maybe some missionaries do, and we
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.800]   admire them from a distance.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.160]   You never fully understand what that means.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.640]   And you never think that that applies to you directly, because the application of that
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:27.600]   just doesn't make sense to you, because you just wanted to give it a try.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.280]   What makes a church challenging in our generation is we have churches that are filled with people
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.160]   who have just kind of come in through optimism, through family.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.100]   We have people who are desperate at one point, but no longer desperate today.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.360]   We have some people who came in because they love the friends that they're hanging out
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.320]   with, and then just people who are just kind of sampling, tasting, hearing that, but they've
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.400]   never committed their life to Christ.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.480]   And so the warning that was given in chapter 6, verse 4 through 8, is to make sure that
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.200]   the wheat and the tares are separated.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.080]   That the tares, when they hear these warnings, it's irrelevant to them, because they don't
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.040]   really believe.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.840]   So whether it's promises of hope in Christ, or whether it's warning of condemnation, it
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.060]   is not relevant to them, because it's not real.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.160]   It's not real.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.660]   So the only difference is how long is this guy's sermon going to last?
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.140]   How much time do I need to put in to get to what I want?
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.500]   But the actual content of the message and what it says is irrelevant to them, because
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.340]   they do not believe.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:39.300]   And those are the tares in the church, because the tares only care about the byproduct, and
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.040]   the substance isn't really Christ.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.200]   But for those who are wheat, sometimes we get mixed in with the tares, the warning is
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.240]   really for them.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.840]   The warning is for them to take heed and make sure that we do not just simply drift into
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.340]   oblivion.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:02.160]   That the consequence of just falling asleep is too dangerous for us not to be paying attention.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.960]   And so in 2 Corinthians 13, 5, Apostle Paul says the same thing to the Corinthian church.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.920]   Test yourself to see if you are in the faith.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.680]   Now when he says test yourself to see if you're in the faith, is he saying look inside and
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.400]   see how you feel this morning?
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   Is he asking that?
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.640]   It's like when you sit and close your eyes, do you believe?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.040]   Yeah, right there.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   I see it.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.400]   I feel it right there.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.000]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.400]   Check yourself to see how you feel?
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.640]   He says test yourself to see if you are in the faith, meaning a community of believers.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.480]   Is your life consistent with the things that you profess?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.120]   Are you in the faith?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.240]   Examine yourself or do you not recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.200]   unless indeed you fail the test.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.360]   The reason why he's writing to this Corinthian church is because they were beginning to act
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.580]   like the rest of the world.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.240]   They were being divided.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   They were back fighting.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.960]   They were trying to one up one another.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.360]   And if Apostle Paul says anything that he didn't like, they didn't like, they would
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.720]   say, "Oh, maybe he's not speaking for God."
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.840]   Even though he was speaking directly the words of Christ.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.440]   And so the warning is given in order for the drifting church to pay attention and to be
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.080]   anchored back to Christ.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.320]   That was the whole point.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.840]   And you could clearly see that, that that was his intent.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.240]   His intent was not to scare them.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.680]   His intent was to make sure that their assurance of salvation is founded upon truth and not
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   wishful thinking, not false narratives that our generation has created.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.320]   That as long as my faith is better, as long as I'm acting as soon as, as long as I'm not
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.840]   doing these bad things, but is it founded upon truth?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:50.600]   In Hebrews chapter 6, 9, Paul, or I say Paul because I think it's Paul who wrote it, but
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:58.200]   the author of the book of Hebrews, right, makes what it seems like a U-turn.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.680]   Because if you look at verse 8, it ends by saying, "But after everything has been given
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.140]   to you, if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed,
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.000]   and it ends up being burned."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.160]   It sounds a lot like John chapter 15, right?
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.540]   If a tree does not bear any fruit, the axe is being laid to be cut down and to be burned.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.160]   And basically he's saying the condemnation is waiting.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.260]   In other words, if there is, if your faith is not real, right?
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:33.720]   So he ends this very difficult passage to the church with a stark warning that if your
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.100]   faith is not real, there will be no fruit.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:43.880]   And if you recognize there's no fruit, right, there is no salvation.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.100]   But then after he says that in verse 9, "But, beloved, we are convinced of better things
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.680]   concerning you."
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.060]   It almost sounds like he's doing a U-turn, right?
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.360]   After saying like, "You don't bear any fruit, there's only thorns and thistles, you're going
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:07.640]   to be burned up and judged, but of you particularly, we are confident that this is not you."
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.660]   And the things that accompany salvation, things we are speaking in this way, that we have
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.920]   seen evidence of this.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.120]   Now, he describes this more in detail in chapter 10.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.160]   How they were being persecuted and how their other Christians were being dragged into jail
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.240]   and they were there ministering to them.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:34.120]   And so he says, "At one point in your walk with God, there was genuine evidence.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.440]   There was genuine evidence of your faith in the way that you walk."
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.000]   So the point of what he's trying to say is, "I've seen some of this."
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.400]   And so the reason why I'm telling you all of this is so that you would recognize that
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.720]   you are in the faith.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.200]   And so when you recognize that you really are in the faith, that you would begin to
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.300]   catch yourself from drifting and be anchored back to Christ.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.280]   And that's why he writes what he writes.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:09.520]   But again, the point of this is so that their assurance may be founded upon truth and not
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   wishful thinking.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.040]   Again, in 1 John 5, 13, John does the exact same thing.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.440]   He spends all four and a half, five chapters telling the recipients of that letter that
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:25.200]   if you say that you have fellowship with God and you live in darkness, you fool yourself.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.000]   I don't care how many verses you memorized.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.960]   I don't care if you grew up in the church.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.000]   I don't care how many things that you've experienced.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.760]   I don't care how much money you paid to the church.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.000]   I don't care how hard you serve.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.200]   I don't care what kind of position you have.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.320]   If you are living in darkness, you have no fellowship with God because God is light and
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.460]   there is no darkness in Him.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.280]   And so he spends four chapters basically just like a surgeon going in and he's dividing
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.960]   and saying, "These are what Christians are.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.020]   These are what non-Christians are."
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.400]   But at the end conclusion of that, he says, "These things I have written to you who believe
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.600]   in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:08.960]   In other words, if you find yourself, if you genuinely have this faith, this is what genuine
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.560]   faith, these are the fruits of genuine faith.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.520]   And these are the fruits of fake faith.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.360]   And so for those of you who genuinely have this faith so that you may be certain that
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   you have eternal life.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.160]   So the point of this is not to get them to question their salvation, but to be assured
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.600]   of their salvation based upon truth.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.000]   And that's why he begins to turn his table, "Now that I've said everything that I've said
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to you, I want you to leave with this assurance."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.240]   But again, this assurance is based upon something concrete.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.440]   And he mentions three things here in this passage.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.800]   One, he already mentioned about love.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.400]   They've already shown the greatest evidence of salvation is in the way that they practice
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.880]   love previously.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:02.280]   Secondly, he says, he encourages them, he challenges them that because you've had that,
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.500]   now you need to persevere in hope.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.720]   Not only did you have this evidence, but that you need to persevere in this evidence of
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.180]   this love.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.040]   And then he finishes it with a third evidence, which is faith.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.560]   Where he tells them, "Now you have this evidence of love.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.060]   Now you need to persevere and stop drifting.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.560]   And then third, you need to look upon the people who have faith that have gone before
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.160]   you and to practice the faith that they practice so that you may endure to the end."
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:38.320]   So love, hope, and faith are the three things that he says are the evidence of genuine salvation.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.440]   So let's look at the first one that he says, love.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.120]   Love is the first evidence that he mentions in Hebrews 6.10.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   "For God is not unjust, so as to forget your works and the love which you have shown toward
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.400]   his name in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints."
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:01.440]   You notice here that the first thing that he mentions here is love, but love for who?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.320]   Love for who?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.980]   Love for his name, right?
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.400]   And how is love for his name manifested?
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.520]   For love for the brothers.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   And so love for God overflows to the love for the brothers.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.800]   But here he mentions, he says, "The first evidence of someone being genuinely saved."
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:29.680]   His covenant relationship with God is that that love that God showed him is evidence
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.800]   in the way that he interacts with other people.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:39.280]   And that's why if you look at Jesus restoring Peter, after he denies him three times, before
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.400]   he ascends, remember he asked Peter, "Peter, do you genuinely love me?"
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.640]   And what does Peter say?
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.040]   "You know I love you."
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.000]   And when he confirms that love, what does Jesus say to him?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Then what?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.280]   Then relax.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Is that what he says?
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.280]   "Do you love me?"
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.000]   "Of course I love you."
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.800]   Then take it easy.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.480]   Stop beating yourself on the head.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480]   Is that what he says?
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   What does he say?
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.200]   "If you love me, then feed my sheep."
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.960]   If you love me, then love my sheep.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.120]   And he says that three separate times.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.020]   If you love me, then feed my sheep.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.800]   If you love me, then love my children.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.400]   You know, you can love people without loving God.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.440]   You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   Because everybody, as far as I know, practices some kind of love.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.720]   Mother loves their children.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.000]   You don't have to be a Christian to love your children.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.600]   Husband loves their wives, and wives love their husbands.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.940]   You don't have to be a Christian to love your wives and husbands.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.200]   You can love your friends, your brothers, co-workers.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.400]   You can practice all those kinds of love without being a Christian.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.560]   That is not unique to Christianity.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.160]   The love that Jesus is referring to is a covenant love, agape love, where he calls us to practice
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.780]   the love that Christ practiced with us.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:07.200]   And he said, "If you love one another as I have loved you, then the world will know that
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.380]   you are my disciples."
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.960]   But the love that he is referring to as a standard is his love toward us.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.700]   And while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.280]   Loving people that are difficult to love, loving people that you would not naturally
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.520]   love, this agape love that is not within us.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.200]   It's not in us.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.960]   To turn the other cheek, to love people that are our enemies, that we consider enemies,
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.560]   that is not in us.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:40.040]   And that's why he says, "The evidence that you've been loved by an alien love, that is
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.440]   not something that you experienced with your mom or dad.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.400]   You didn't experience that with your friends because they loved you because you were their
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   children.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.240]   They loved you because you were brothers.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.740]   They loved you because you were their friends.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.200]   But this agape love from God toward us is an alien love.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.000]   And so the evidence that this alien love, that you are a recipient of this alien love,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.040]   is that that alien love is evidenced in you.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.720]   That's why he says in 1 John 4, 19, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.840]   You can practice store gate love, family love.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.040]   You can practice heiress love, romantic love.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.720]   You can practice filial love, friendship love.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:28.040]   But you cannot practice agape love until you've been loved by Christ in that way.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.340]   And that's why he says that's the greatest evidence.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.960]   I think many of you saw this week, if you haven't, I don't know where you've been, the
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:43.400]   video of this young man who's 18 years old, whose older brother was shot by a police officer.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.240]   Some of you guys may have seen that.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.160]   His name is Brant Jean, and his older brother, Botham Jeans, is the older man, his older
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.920]   brother who got shot by this off-duty police officer who was living in the same apartment
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   complex.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.880]   She lived in the fourth floor, and she got off the wrong floor in the elevator, and she
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.600]   went into her apartment, or she thought, on the third floor, and just door happened to
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.240]   be open when she walked in.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.860]   There was a tall, young black man, and she got threatened.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.840]   She pulled out her gun and shot him to death.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.000]   And so the trial went out, and she was indicted as guilty of second-degree murder.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.800]   So she was given 10 years for her crime.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.280]   Now, after the sentencing, the tradition is they would give one of the family members
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.440]   an opportunity to speak out, and basically, usually in those scenes, one of the family
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.080]   members, a mother, father, or brother would go on the stand and basically rebuke the killer
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   for what they did.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.920]   "You took my brother's life, and so now I'm glad that they're taking your life."
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.320]   And in fact, the Bible has a very detailed description of this particular scene, and
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.920]   the whole reason why the cities of refuge were built.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:03.540]   If somebody kills somebody by accident, the closest relative who is assigned to take vengeance
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:09.840]   upon the perpetrator is called the avenger of blood.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.280]   That's the actual name for that person, because they know that in order for that person's
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.080]   blood to be satisfied, the avenger of blood would come after them.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.560]   But if it was an accident, the perpetrator would be given an opportunity to run to the
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:30.600]   city of refuge, and the cities of refuge, the mayor or the ruler of the six cities of
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.040]   refuge that was built in Israel, was basically run by the high priest.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.280]   So under the protection of the high priest, that person, after hearing their story and
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.440]   what is deemed to be an accident, they're brought in to protect them from the avenger
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.800]   of blood.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.520]   This young man, 18-year-old, according to scripture, would have been that person, would
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.600]   have been the avenger of blood, and would have been rightfully been in a position to
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.360]   take vengeance upon that police officer.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.500]   And usually they do.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.360]   They will come and say, "You took my brother.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.200]   I can't believe you did that.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.220]   I hope you rot in hell that they never bring you out of jail."
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:16.200]   But instead, he got on the stand, and he began to share the love of Christ.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.600]   He says, "I forgive you.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.840]   I don't want you to go to jail.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.360]   And if you're genuinely asking for forgiveness, our God will forgive you.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.120]   And if after all of this, if you would just give your life to Christ."
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.480]   And then after that, he asked if he can hug her, and he came off the stand and did something
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.160]   that no one would have understood.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.320]   Why is he doing that?
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.880]   And he began to hug her in tears.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.400]   I must have watched this video 10 times.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.240]   It brought me to tears.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.480]   Not simply because of this young man, but because of the picture.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:58.160]   And I think his witness was so much more powerful than any sermon that I can possibly give.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.520]   Because we saw a living illustration of the power of the love of Christ.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5.14, the love of Christ controls us.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.200]   In the NIV, it says, "It compels us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.720]   all died."
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.800]   What that young man did is not something that you and I can muster up.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   It's not something that he had special blood in him.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.880]   There's something different about that young man's genetics that is more forgiving than
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.380]   an average person.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.720]   Only a person who has been deeply affected by the love of Christ, agape love of Christ,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   can overflow to share that love to other people.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:43.120]   And that's why Jesus says, "The greatest mark of a Christian is the practice of the love
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   that they receive themselves."
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.920]   So that young man was compelled by the love of Christ to love that individual.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   First John 3.14 says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   the brethren.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.680]   But he who does not love abides in death."
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.480]   You know what was so powerful about that?
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:12.760]   That after he did that and hugged, afterwards, the judge came off of where she was and in
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.460]   tears, there's a picture of the judge and the officer who was about to go to jail hugging,
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.900]   and both of them in tears.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.520]   She walked into her private chambers, grabbed her Bible and gave it to her.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.640]   And as she was giving it to the officer going to jail, the judge said, "Ma'am, it's not
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.860]   because I am good.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.160]   It's because I believe in Christ.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.140]   None of us are worthy."
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:43.080]   Because of that young man's love and demonstrating that agape love for somebody that he had every
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:52.680]   right to take vengeance, that judge had the courage to be able to do what she did.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.720]   And I bet that I'm not the only one talking about that event today.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.800]   I'll bet all throughout the Christian world that what that young man did was being talked
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.640]   about because it deeply affected me.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.280]   It wasn't just talk.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.540]   It wasn't just some theory that we talk about on Sunday.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.400]   We saw a live example of what the love of Christ does to people.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:24.600]   And so that's why he says, "Even though I say all of these things, I am convinced that
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   that's not you because I saw your love in the beginning.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.760]   I saw your sacrifice.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.400]   I saw how you loved the brethren.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.480]   But the point is to continue."
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.720]   In fact, one of the most powerful witnesses of the early church was love.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   It was love.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.520]   It wasn't the courage, "I'm going to die for Jesus.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   I'm going to do this for Christ."
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.600]   It wasn't their talent.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.440]   It wasn't because well-educated high officials came to Christ.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.200]   The early church was made up of people who at one point were enemies.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   Jews and Gentiles sitting together worshiping God.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.680]   You had runaway slaves who could have been executed for running away, sitting with their
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.240]   former masters, calling each other brothers and sisters.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.040]   We had Pharisees sitting and listening and being taught by a tax collector that they
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.900]   despised.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:17.500]   So no matter how much the sociologists and historians try to explain away the beginning
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.400]   of Christianity, the church just doesn't make sense.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:28.300]   So that's why they believe even the people who are antagonistic to the Christian faith,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.420]   something must have happened.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.900]   They refuse to acknowledge the resurrection of Christ, but they can't explain the early
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.020]   church.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.780]   So their explanation is they must have believed, but they must have been deceived that Jesus
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.820]   didn't really resurrect, that he swooned and he fainted for a while, was a mass hypnotist,
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.040]   he had a twin brother, because that's the closest that they can explain why these enemies
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.340]   all of a sudden came into the same church and started calling each other brothers and
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.020]   sisters in Christ.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.380]   He says that the first evidence, the reason why he has confidence is because he says,
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.140]   "You had it."
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   But it's the second point.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.200]   It's not just love, but the second point that he's trying to get to is for them to continue
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.420]   in this, in hope.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.660]   In Hebrews chapter 11, chapter 6, 11, "And we desire that each one of you show the same
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.660]   diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end."
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.220]   What you had in the beginning that you don't just rely on and say, "You know what?
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.100]   I used to have that."
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.940]   So many Christians live the rest of their lives on what they experienced when they were
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.700]   back in college.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   Were like that.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.700]   "Oh, I used to do that.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.020]   Oh, I used to go feed.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.700]   I used to go evangelize.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.060]   I used to go to missions.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.660]   And then I got old, had kids.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.460]   I just can't do that in my stage of life."
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.860]   And we have all kinds of excuses, and everything that we talked about is what it was like in
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.420]   the past.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.460]   But every intent and purposes, we have drifted.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.460]   We're no longer walking.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.500]   We're no longer loving.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.440]   We're no longer practicing the things that we profess to believe.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   So he says, "In hope, persevering in hope to show the same diligence as first."
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.460]   That's why he says to the church of Ephesus, "You have all these great things, but you
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.320]   have forsaken your first love.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.340]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.720]   Remember when you were there.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.300]   Remember when you were passionate for God.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.440]   Remember the height from which you had fallen, and then repent."
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.620]   Repentance basically is to acknowledge where we are is not where we should be.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.900]   To stop explaining it off as this is normal.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.480]   This is not normal.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.460]   What you and I experience in Christianity here is not normal.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.020]   If somebody who wasn't a Christian, who wasn't raised in the church, read the Bible and saw
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.460]   the church, would they recognize this as the same thing?
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.780]   We think what's happening in India, what's happening in North Korea, what's happening
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.820]   in the Middle East is strange.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.620]   But that's normal because that's what's described in the Scripture.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.700]   What we experience here is not normal.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.740]   So remember the height from which we had fallen, and then repent, recognize that this is not
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.120]   where we ought to be.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.900]   And then redo the things that we did at first.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.400]   And that's exactly what he is saying here, to show the same diligence, realizing the
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.900]   full assurance of hope until the end.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.420]   In other words, that you have to have this assurance.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.940]   This assurance has to be until the end.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.380]   In chapter 10, verse 36, "For you have need of endurance so that when you have done the
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.100]   will of God, you may receive what was promised."
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.580]   And that's why he's writing this, to persevere.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.100]   Don't just start well, you need to finish well.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:48.260]   I remember, there's a lot of things that my dad said that I heard, but I didn't really
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.700]   listen.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.860]   Because he was a pastor, so he knew the path that I was heading into better than anybody
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.020]   else in my life, because he knew me, and he was my dad.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.660]   But he was of the Presbyterian faith.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.900]   I got saved at a parachurch, happened to be a lot more charismatic, and so I couldn't
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.580]   relate to his faith when I was younger.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.620]   Because it wasn't as dynamic as it excited.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.700]   To me, it's very boring.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.780]   I grew up in a Presbyterian church, and they sang hymns and liturgical, and my dad would
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:22.300]   wear robes when he would preach, and it all sounded kind of legalistic to me.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   The older I get, the more I remember things that he said, sometimes in passing.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.340]   And I remember one of the things that he said to me that stuck with me, even though I didn't
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.860]   hear it, he told me, and I said, "Oh, okay, okay, okay."
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:38.440]   And one of the things that I remember him telling me was, "It's more important how you
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.740]   finish than how you start."
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.780]   You probably heard it many times before, too.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:50.260]   And I heard it like that, "It's more important how you finish than how you start."
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.460]   Of course it's more important how you finish than how you start.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:34:00.340]   But the longer I live, the more that begins to weigh, is weightiness.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.420]   Because it's easy to start, but it's much harder to finish.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.980]   It's easy to get excited about things in the beginning, in the marriage, even in church
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.740]   planting.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.940]   It's always exciting in the beginning.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.260]   We're planting a church, we're organizing things, we're doing things, but after about
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.180]   five years, ten years, you're not church planting anymore.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.940]   You don't have this desire to evangelize.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.300]   It's passionate when you're in college, when you have the whole life ahead of you, but
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.540]   now that you're with children and you're tied up and you got a job and you got a schedule,
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.500]   you got to wake up, no matter how passionate you are, on Sunday you still have to wake
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.860]   up on Monday morning to go to work.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.740]   It's more important how you finish than how you start.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.220]   And that's basically what he is saying.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.340]   You started well, but you've drifted.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.540]   You have need of endurance to continue.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:54.220]   Hebrews chapter 12, "To fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:35:00.900]   the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and has sat down at the
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.220]   right hand of the throne of God."
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.300]   Even Christ, he endured the cross.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.200]   He didn't love the cross.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.380]   He endured the cross.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.860]   Why did he endure the cross?
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.580]   Because there was hope of joy on the other side.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.980]   The reason why we persevere through what we persevere is because the hope that we have
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.380]   on the other side.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.420]   It's not because we enjoy hardship.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:30.420]   In fact, loving people that are hard to love, I mean, it forces you to be sanctified.
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.100]   It tears you apart inside.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.040]   But there's joy on the other side.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.020]   And so he says to persevere in hope, you have love, but you need to continue in hope.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.060]   Galatians 6, 7, "Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.660]   we do not lose hope."
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.820]   Paul writes to the second Timothy, chapter 4, verse 8, and he's sitting in prison writing
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.860]   that letter too, just like many of us are studying through and some of you guys are
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.300]   memorizing through the book of Philippians.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.980]   He's sitting in prison and in Philippians, the first time he's in jail, he's writing
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.580]   this letter of joy in the midst of suffering.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.740]   I've learned the secret of being content in every and all situation.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.820]   He's the one sitting in prison, chained to a Roman guard, encouraging the people sitting
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   outside to rejoice.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.580]   And I guess I say rejoice.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.580]   But by the time he writes second Timothy, there's a different tone because even in the
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.900]   early church, they felt fatigue.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.660]   After only about 10 years, 10 to 12 years since Philippians and second Timothy is
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.420]   being written, after second Timothy, he doesn't come out, he gets beheaded, and that's the
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.900]   last letter he writes.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:51.820]   And in this last letter, we can see that the fatigue has come into the church and many
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.940]   of the prominent leaders, we're not talking about churchgoers, prominent leaders were
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.100]   beginning to backslide and go back home.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:05.860]   Second Timothy 4a, "For Demas, having loved the present world, has deserted me and gone
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   to Thessalonica.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.220]   Trescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.980]   Now there's a debate as to whether Titus is one of the people he's mentioning that's
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.660]   backslid.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.700]   And most commentaries are unwilling to say that Titus backslid because Titus is such
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.580]   a prominent figure in the New Testament.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.300]   But there is no good argument that I've seen in the commentaries that maybe Titus also
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   did backslide.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.840]   We don't know that for sure.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.020]   But what we do know is that the early church leaders, many of these prominent men who are
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.260]   risking their lives sharing the gospel in the beginning of Paul's ministry, by the time
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.160]   Paul's sitting in prison, is abandoning their faith and going back home.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   They were backsliding.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:56.720]   And so by the time he writes Second Timothy, the tone is very different than Philippians.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.440]   Main theme in Second Timothy is, "Timothy, don't let this happen to you."
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   That's what he said.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.620]   That's the last thing that he says before he dies.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.520]   What a discouraging letter to write.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:17.120]   "Timothy, don't let this happen to you."
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.800]   Can you imagine how disappointed he must have been that after everything?
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.960]   It happened in the beginning.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.760]   We typically think, you know, we put the hard work in the beginning and glory and then we
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.440]   go to Christ.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.040]   But it didn't happen that way.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.640]   The glory was in the beginning.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.080]   And then he kind of fizzled out at the end.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.760]   I mean, we have his letter, so now we talk about all of his ministry.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.880]   But if you were sitting where he was, he was probably very discouraged.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.280]   His friends were abandoning him.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.720]   People were going and saying, "Timothy, don't let this happen to you."
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.400]   According to church history, Church of Ephesus is where Paul spent the most time.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.880]   He had the most affection probably for this church because he had connection.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   Even before he went to prison in Rome, he spent all night talking with the elders of
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.760]   Ephesus, warning them about false teachers that are coming.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.640]   The very last letter that he writes to Timothy is to prepare him to go back to Ephesus to
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.480]   fight these false teachers.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.200]   But according to church history, Church of Ephesus actually falls.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.120]   The Judaizers come in, they overtake this church, and they actually disappear early
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.600]   on.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.280]   They don't make it.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.100]   That's the reality.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:35.280]   And that's why he says, "Persevere."
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.040]   Not only do we have love, but this love must continue based upon this hope.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.200]   Let me ask you.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.800]   If you're driving, I'm assuming most of you are driving, right?
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.840]   Or at least 70-80% of you are driving.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   If you catch yourself falling asleep, at what point would you pull over?
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:59.440]   And some of you guys, you're like, "No, I'm going to fight this."
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:07.960]   Some of you guys who are younger, and you don't really realize how dangerous that is.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.480]   Because all you need to do is fall asleep one time.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.560]   Not five times, one time.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.720]   If you actually fall asleep one time, it could mean death.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.800]   Your car could just flip over, it could go to the side, you could crash into somebody.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.960]   This is not something that you want to mess around with.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.360]   I've fallen asleep enough when I was young, I don't mess with that.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.120]   Drinking Coke and talking to myself doesn't work.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   I just pull over, even if it's a five-minute nap, I'll take a nap when I recalibrate my
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.900]   mind, and then I can get back on the road.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.520]   And every year of my life, that distance that I can travel without falling asleep is shortening.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:55.000]   If I go to LA, I know at some point I might have to pull over.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.720]   But you can't, because if you fall asleep, you're going to die.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.680]   You're not going to get a flat tire, you're not going to get a ticket, you're going to
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   die.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:10.640]   See, he's talking to people who at one point were passionate for God, but they've been
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.680]   drifting back, and they're not denying Christ, they just wanted to stay somewhere between
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.800]   Judaism and Christianity.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:24.040]   So they wouldn't be persecuted by their people, nor do they want to reject Christ.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.840]   And so the author is saying, "You can't do that.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.240]   Either you are with Christ-gathering, or you are against Christ-gathering.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.400]   There is no middle ground.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.920]   What you started, you must persevere."
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:42.520]   1 John 3, 2-3, "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   we will be.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.640]   But know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.840]   He is.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.840]   And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself just as He is pure."
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:42:02.600]   Third and finally, "Faith in Christ," Hebrews 6-12, "so that you will not be sluggish, but
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:09.160]   imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.000]   Through faith and patience inherit the promises.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.280]   And obviously this leads into chapter 11.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.560]   If you know Hebrews chapter 11, we call that the chapter of what?
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   Chapter of faith.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.720]   Because the whole chapter is faith.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.160]   By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.880]   You know, if there's one chapter that I believe as a whole that is misapplied in all of the
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   Bible, it's probably this chapter.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   There's a lot of verses.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.040]   There's a lot of words that are misapplied.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.440]   But this whole chapter is misapplied.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.760]   Because typically I hear people quoting Hebrews chapter 11 saying, "It's by faith, not by
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760]   works."
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.840]   It's by faith, by faith, by faith, by faith.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:51.360]   But you know, if you see it in the context of the point of chapter 11 is, for 10 chapters
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:59.320]   the author is arguing, you claim to have faith, but you keep drifting back to your old life.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.560]   If you have genuine faith, anchor yourself to Christ.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.760]   And then chapter 11, he says, "By faith Abel did this.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.680]   By faith Enoch did this.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.320]   By faith Noah did this.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.200]   By faith Abraham did this.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.120]   By faith Sarah did this."
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.080]   So basically what he's saying is, true faith is the foundation upon the courage that they
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.640]   had to live for Christ.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.440]   The reason why they were able to abandon all of this past is because they believed in God
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.400]   and then they went out.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.720]   Even though they wandered in the desert and they died and they never entered into the
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.680]   physical promised land, they believed that there was a spiritual promised land that was
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   coming.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.040]   If they were looking for rest, they could have just easily have gone home, but it is
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.920]   because of this faith that caused them to live in courage.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.480]   So the way that a lot of people quote chapter 11 is completely the opposite of the meaning
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.160]   of why chapter 11 is there.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:01.560]   Chapter 11 is to challenge the wheat that have been drifting to make sure that your
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.360]   faith is genuine.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.080]   That's exactly what it says in John chapter 15, 4-5.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.800]   As Jesus is leaving the disciples, he says, "Abide in me and I in you, as a branch cannot
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.040]   bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.680]   So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.820]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:29.040]   He who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:35.480]   The word abide here is just another word for anchor.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.200]   The word abide here is another word that Hebrews uses for anchor.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.640]   If you're not anchored in Christ, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.400]   It doesn't matter how smart you are, it doesn't matter how much experience you have, it doesn't
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:55.640]   matter your past experiences, your giftedness, it doesn't matter how much money you can give.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.900]   He says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.200]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:09.120]   This word abide is not just a word that we should just kind of pass by, because in the
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   New Testament, there are certain words that you can't translate with one word.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.520]   Like the word love, right?
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   We use the word love.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:22.680]   I love my pet, I love my children, I love boba, I love soccer, I love driving, I love
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.100]   God.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.440]   We use the same word.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.680]   So it's important that we understand the specific nuance of this word in the New Testament.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.880]   It's agape, phileo, storge.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.620]   Well this word abide, basically what Christ is saying is your whole Christian life is
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.640]   contingent upon this word abide, because if you don't abide, you can't bear fruit.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.920]   So if you're not abiding, you can evangelize, you will not bear fruit.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.740]   You can preach, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.120]   You can work hard and give, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.460]   You can be trained in seminary, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.120]   You can have a PhD in theology, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.160]   You can be the smartest guy, most talented guy, you cannot bear fruit.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.680]   And bearing fruit isn't just talking about sanctification.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   He says if you do not bear fruit, what happens?
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.080]   Axe is laid on the ground, chopped to be burned.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.880]   In other words, there is no salvation without abiding.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:24.300]   So abiding is the key that links us to justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.860]   So how important is this word?
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.760]   It's central.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.840]   It's central.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.280]   That's why the word in Greek, "meno," in your different translations is translated differently.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.420]   Some of your translations says abide.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.840]   Some of your translations says remain.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.120]   Some of your translations will say continue.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.800]   And it uses different word because all of those words, the meaning is contained in that one word.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   So it doesn't just mean one thing.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.960]   It has to be understood comprehensively because it's a very important word.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   So let me just summarize the meaning of this word because the word anchor here in Hebrews
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.300]   is used in a similar way.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.220]   Like if you're not anchored in Christ, you may lead to apostasy.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.780]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.680]   You cannot live out your salvation.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.760]   So this word, "meno," let me summarize in three ways.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.600]   It means to remain or to continue.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.640]   It means to rest in Christ.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.520]   And it means to rely upon Christ.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.840]   It means to remain, rest, and rely.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:36.040]   And that's exactly what the author of Hebrews has been trying to convey to them.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.440]   Hebrews chapter 2, 1, "Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to what we have
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.560]   heard lest we drift away from it."
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.600]   You must be anchored and continue.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.880]   And then you must rest in Christ.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.520]   Our rest is not founded upon our works but upon the completed work of Christ.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.320]   Hebrews 4, 1, "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.720]   fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it."
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.860]   Let us rest.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.080]   And then Hebrews 4, 16, "Let us rely.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.440]   Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.600]   mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.640]   Okay.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.600]   I have one more sermon to give.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.440]   Not that I'm going anywhere, but I'm taking a break.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:34.400]   And I've been thinking about, you know, if next Sunday was my last sermon that I ever
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   give, right?
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.080]   Don't get me wrong, that's not the intention, right?
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.440]   But you know, as a preacher, we get taught that all the time from previous generation
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.080]   and generation that's gone before us, you know, preach every sermon like it's your last
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   sermon.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.000]   It sounds good on paper, but it's hard to do because I got to come back next week.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.560]   You know, if I pour my heart out today, what am I going to do?
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.840]   I got to save some for next week, right?
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.520]   But since I'm going to be taking a break for a while, I've been thinking like, "What would
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:11.360]   I want to convey to the church if it was my last sermon?"
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.040]   And I'm still thinking.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.680]   I'm thinking through all of these things.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:21.880]   But to be honest, I don't know if it would be any different than what he's saying here.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:29.520]   I don't know if it's any different because our primary problem in where you and I are
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.380]   is this.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:37.520]   We don't have the government knocking down the door, you know, scaring us with guns and
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.600]   threatening your jobs because you're here.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:49.640]   Our children are in nice air-conditioned rooms with being fed donuts with people that love
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.840]   them and care for them.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.680]   Then after today, it's not, "Can we eat?"
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   But, "What are we going to eat?
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   Where are we going to eat?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   Who are we going to eat?"
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.280]   You know, that's our biggest struggle.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.240]   And so, when the Bible tells us that we're in spiritual warfare, the spiritual warfare
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:16.640]   that you and I are in is realizing that we're in spiritual warfare, that we can just drift
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:22.960]   because we were raised in the church and at one point we made a commitment and because
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.520]   my friends are all here and because out of habit and just drift like this until the day
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:37.120]   we die and then the reality hits us when we meet Christ.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:43.840]   So when I pray for our church, and I've been praying this since the beginning of our church,
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.920]   and it's the same prayer that I pray even now every day when I pray for our church,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:51:00.840]   that God would open our eyes, that we would see the reality of where you and I are.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:12.160]   Because the path to hell in Orange County Christianity is a luxury boat.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.320]   It's a luxury boat.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.560]   We don't sense any danger.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.640]   There is no urgency.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   There's no desperation.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.440]   So because of that, it affects our faith.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.500]   I know that because I struggle with it.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.880]   Every time I go out of the country, I come back.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:41.400]   I sense a spiritual oppression here.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.680]   And it's not an oppression of fighting and darkness.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   It's just lukewarmness.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:56.360]   People who are drifting and not realizing the danger that they're in.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:06.560]   My prayer is that we would gear up for the next stage of our church.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:13.840]   You and I have been given more opportunities and more access to God than any Christian
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.040]   could have possibly imagined in their wildest dreams.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:22.160]   To wake up in the middle of the night and hear the best sermons online.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.960]   We read the Bible, but we want translation.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.680]   I mean, there were periods in church history where just by translating into our language,
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.480]   people got killed.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:37.960]   Now we're wrestling with which version of this translation that we should be using.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.760]   The problem isn't the Bible itself.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.320]   The problem that we have is people not being interested in the Bible.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:50.080]   Where all throughout history, the greatest problem was access to the Bible.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:57.920]   Now we have this access, unthinkable access to the Bible, and we're not interested.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:05.440]   But can you imagine with all the resources that God has given you and me, our youth,
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:12.160]   our finances, just the fact that you speak English, you can travel the world and communicate
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.720]   with more than half the world just because you speak English.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:22.120]   And if you speak Chinese on top of English, that's another 30% to add to that.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:28.800]   So 70% of the world will speak either Mandarin or English.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.120]   I don't know what the other language is.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:36.320]   If you speak Korean, maybe 1%, I don't know.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:41.920]   But the privilege that we have, U.S. citizenship, because of our passport, the access that we
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:47.600]   have to majority of the world that we can get into.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:57.520]   Our problem in our generation is not access, is not finance, is not talent, is not opportunity,
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:05.960]   is not training, because we have more of that than any Christian human being has ever had
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.160]   in history, every single one of us in this room.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.280]   Our problem is our lack of our own will.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   We're so distracted with trivial things in our lives that there is no room for God.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:29.340]   We say we do on Sunday, but when you have a bucket and 95% of that is filled with things
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:35.080]   that don't matter in eternity and we bring a tiny little cup to God on Sunday and wondering
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:42.560]   why we're not overflowing in his spirit, that's our greatest challenge.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:49.400]   So my prayer is, the purpose of the sabbatical is so that I can gear up for that for the
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.800]   next stage.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:57.020]   My hope is that we would do the same, that God has given us resources that we've never
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.380]   had in our church history.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:07.920]   We have people that are coming, people who are already here, and to really be good stewards
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.100]   of what God has given us.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:18.540]   Every hardship that you've experienced as a Christian is a tool that God sanctified
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:24.740]   you, that God can use for whatever else that he has in store.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.320]   Whatever training you've gotten, whatever sermons you've heard, whatever mission work
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:33.460]   you've had, whatever paycheck that you're getting, if you're in health, whatever situation
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:38.380]   that you're in, every single one of those things, if we can imagine if we can mobilize
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:45.420]   all of that and then if God gives us a heart for the world, what we can do.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.540]   But what we lack is heart.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.840]   What we lack is faith.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:55.780]   Hopefully that we can restore that and gear up for the next stage of our church.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:04.780]   And my prayer is that every single one of us in this room would experience what it feels
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:13.380]   like to be a non-Christian who doesn't know Christ, who doesn't have hope, that you would
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:20.380]   remember what it was like before you met Christ, so that you can live your life as an ambassador
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.060]   for these people.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.740]   We have someone who's interceding for us for eternity.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:35.220]   So we need to intercede for those who do not have Christ.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.900]   We see Christ through the Word.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:40.120]   They will see Christ through us.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:49.340]   So let's stop making excuses of our busyness, of our tiredness, of our hurt, whatever situation
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.100]   that we're in.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   Let's mobilize.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.100]   Amen?
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.100]   Let's mobilize.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:57:02.020]   Let's take some time to take a step back, mobilize ourselves, encourage, consider how
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:09.580]   to stimulate one another toward loving good deeds, and let's make an impact in our generation.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:16.140]   And my hope and prayer is that we can bring as many people to Christ before our generation
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.140]   is over.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   Amen?
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.140]   Let's pray.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:48.380]   Father, Lord, we pray for revival.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.700]   Revive us.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:58.220]   Revive our church.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.960]   Revive the churches.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:06.300]   Revive the generation.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:17.100]   Let your glory be so evident in us and through us and around us that non-Christian family
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:28.460]   members, friends, strangers will at least know that we believe in this hope in Jesus
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.660]   Christ.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:37.180]   I pray that for our inheritance that you would give us the lost.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.300]   Help us to live with eternal perspective.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.220]   Lord, help us.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:49.980]   Help us bring your children to yourself.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   If we've been drifting, bring us back.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:59:00.100]   Strengthen us, Lord God, that we may honor and glorify you with our lives.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.260]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
