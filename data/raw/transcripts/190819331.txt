[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   They're in two different sections, but again,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   the heaviest teaching of the Holy Spirit is in John chapter
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   14, 15, and 16, and also Romans chapter 7 and 8.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   So I wanted to really get to this last week, but I thought today would be more
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   appropriate, so we're going to be doing the exposition on John 15,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   or at least a portion of that, and then we'll jump back to Romans chapter 8.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So we want to read Romans chapter 8, verse 12-17 before we jump there.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Okay? Romans chapter 8, verse 12-17.

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles again to John chapter 15.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   John chapter 15, and I will read there from
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   verse 1-6.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Actually up to verse 7.

[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   [reading verse 7-8 on screen]
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I don't know if any of you have any experience planting vegetables
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   or flowers or herbs or anything like that.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You know the joy that comes from at the end after you've done it
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   whether it takes a few months or a while and you start to see the fruit.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I know some of you guys in your backyard have planted trees, whatever trees you have.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And it may take years before you actually see the fruit.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I don't have a whole lot of experience. The only real experience I've ever had was planting
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   corn when my parents owned a home in Corona.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And my dad decided to plant corn all over our yard, front yard and the
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   backyard. It was pretty embarrassing. But I remember when
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   he did that one of the first things I noticed is that
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   the corn, the sprouts come out pretty quick.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It took maybe no more than a week or two before we started seeing signs of growth.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And we got pretty excited. And so I would say it took no more than
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   two to three months at most. It might have been less than that where it grew
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   high enough where we began to see the corn coming out. So I remember
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   one day thinking, "Wow, I think in a couple more weeks we're going to be able to eat corn."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And so after a while, I mean my dad planted it everywhere.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So we had a lot of corn. So we thought we're going to have a corn feast today.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And so when the day came and we took all the corn down and we actually started
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   opening it up, we found out it was completely inedible.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   The corn was not yellow like you normally, it was black.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Or it didn't exist at all. It was empty.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And so initially what I thought to be, "Wow, this is pretty easy. Just drop it in the
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   ground and pour water. I mean it just sprouts out." And later on,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I was talking to different people. It's like, "Oh yeah, we did that and it didn't work."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And growing corn is a lot harder than I thought. And they said, "Of course
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   you can't just drop it on the ground. You have to till the land and you have to make sure
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   you have proper fertilizers. And even when you water it, you have to make sure that you have to do
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   this and that." And the rock, the soil that we had
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   in our house was very, very rocky. So we didn't prepare, we didn't think anything
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   because it was just sprouting up. So we thought, "Yes, we got fruit."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The reason why I share this story is because I think
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   spiritually, a lot of people go through that same kind
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   of labor early on in your walk with God.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   That you want to bear fruit. Who doesn't? You're a Christian, you're excited about your faith.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You come to church, you volunteer to serve. You go to short-term missions.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   You lead small groups. And then initially you start to see
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   progress because there's a bit of change in your life and there's certain things that you were
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   challenged by. But if you've been a Christian for a while, you've
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   gone through that period of thinking that there was
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   fruit and then being disappointed.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Being disappointed that it's taken a lot longer than you thought
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   to deal with your character, certain habits
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   that you had. Or even the people around you, you weren't as patient as you'd like to be.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But if you look around you and there's a growing cynicism in you,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   then maybe this is just what it is. There's something missing.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And possibly you may have already maybe even given up in your heart.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So we see a lot of young people who are excited about their faith, but then if you've been a Christian
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   for a while and you went through this cycle, you know, after that experience of
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   planting corn and being disappointed, I've never done it again. Because I don't want
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   to be disappointed. Some of us have spiritually got to a point
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   where you just kind of given up. You're just like, well, you know, what's the
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   point? You know, I've done that before. I've gone to short term missions. I've gotten
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   excited about church and I've done all of this before. And there's a sense of cynicism
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   especially when you see young Christians becoming Christians. You're kind of like,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   yeah, I remember when I was like that. You just wait until you get a full time job
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and see what happens to you. You just wait when you start dating
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and you get married and see what happens. You're going to get rocked. You wait.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   You know, you see young couple who don't have children excited about their faith. You wait
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   once you have a kid and you see what happens to you. And so we
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   have this growing cynicism toward any excitement
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   toward God because we've been there, done that, heard everything.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But the problem with that is that frustration
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   it never leaves. And you just kind of, if you're not careful, you can come to a point, you think
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   that that's what normal Christianity is. And it's completely contradictory to what we
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   see in scripture. Every once in a while you'll hear a testimony
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   of somebody who's passionate for God and it seems so foreign. Something that you read
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   in books or in church history
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   but not reality. But the scripture clearly
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   says the identifying mark of a Christian and non-Christian are fruits.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   If the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   if the God of the universe is dwelling in you
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   wouldn't there be some kind of
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   evidence that that is the case? In fact, Matthew
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   3, 7 and 8 says, "But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   If your repentance is genuine, where is the fruit?'" He says.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So even our very repentance is
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   something that we can identify based upon our fruit. Matthew 13, 23
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "As for what was sown on the good soil" he's talking about four
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   different soils. Remember all three soils. The first three soils for whatever
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   the reason ends up dying. The only fourth soil
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   ends up surviving and he said you need to be like the fourth soil. And this is how
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   he describes the fourth soil. "As for what was sown on good soil" this is the one
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   who hears the word and understands it. "He indeed bears fruit and yields
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, in another thirty."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So if you notice here that each of the fruits, it's different.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Some are thirty, some are sixty, some are a hundredfold. But the
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   unifying, identifying mark of a Christian that doesn't just die
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   out is fruit. So it may look different in the lives of
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   different lives of people, but at the end genuine
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   fruit is what identifies a Christian and a non-Christian. Romans 7, 4
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   belong to another." And I want you to listen carefully to this. "To him
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Why did He die? And why was He resurrected?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Not simply so that we don't go to Hell. He said
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   He didn't say He died and was resurrected so you could be in Heaven forever.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   He says He died and resurrected that you may have a new life and
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that you may bear fruit for God.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   See, the goal of salvation is that we may bear fruit for God.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That we are saved from not only the
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   penalty of sin, but the power of sin.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The corrupting nature of sin. That in bearing fruit that
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   we give Him the ultimate glory. Now, the reason
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   why I am in this passage in John chapter 15, if
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   you read the questions that I asked on the Facebook page, some of you guys
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   who may have read that, if you were paying attention you might have asked
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   the question that I asked was, "What does it mean to abide in
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   the Spirit?" Right? You read that. So, if you were reading carefully
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   you might have asked, if you came to this passage and read that, "Well Jesus is
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   talking about Himself. Why does He ask abiding in the Spirit?"
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And I'm assuming everybody was thinking that, right? Everybody was thinking that. So let me answer this
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   question. The reason why I asked, "What does it mean to abide in
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   the Spirit?" Even though Jesus is talking about Himself. If you look at John chapter
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   14, the main theme is Jesus telling His
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   disciples that He is going to leave. And they are freaking out. If you
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   leave, what about us? And so Jesus tells them to comfort them in verse 18,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "I will not leave you as orphans. I will come to you." And then He
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   describes who this person that is going to come. The Holy Spirit,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   the Helper, the Spirit of Truth. He's going to come and He's
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   going to remind you of everything that I've done. So He says, "I'm not going to leave you alone."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And then He jumps to chapter 15 and He says, "Well if you want to
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   bear fruit and not fall apart, you need to continue
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   with Me. You need to remain with Me." And then He goes back
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   to chapter 16 and He picks back up the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So, if you remember in John,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   in Romans chapter 8 in the previous passage that we looked at, remember
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Paul uses the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and indwelling
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   of Jesus Christ interchangeably. Remember we talked about that? There is
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   a clear declaration of the Trinity in that passage.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   He uses Himself and the Holy Spirit interchangeably. Here He says,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   "I am leaving where I am going. You cannot come, but
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   the Holy Spirit is going to come and you need to remain in Me."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   So, if you look at it consecutively, Jesus
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   basically is telling them to remain in Me by
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   remaining in who? The Holy Spirit. Right? The Holy
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Spirit is coming and He's going to lead you. He's going to remind you. He's going
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   to teach you. So He's using again Himself and the Holy Spirit
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   interchangeably. And that's why I asked the question, "What does it mean to abide in
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Christ? What does it mean to abide in the Spirit?" Now, why is this
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   so important? And we're taking so many Sundays
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   to discuss this issue. The book of John is
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   organized in seven "I Am" statements. It
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   begins in John chapter 6 and it takes us all the way to John chapter 15.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   The seven "I Am" statements, and I want you to listen to the "I Am" statements that
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   this book is--this Gospel is organized in. John chapter
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   6 is, "I am the bread of life." Now I'm not going to go through all
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   of them. But when he says, "I am the bread of life," it's because
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   people were coming to Him and they were seeing a lot of miracles. He
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   just fed 5,000. And so people were thinking, "If I
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   follow Jesus He's going to feed me. If we follow
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Jesus we get free health care. He heals people. We don't even have to go see the
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   doctor. He just says, "Rise." And then they rise. So people were coming to
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Him thinking that if we make Him our King our life is
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   set. And Jesus is trying to change their paradigm that
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I did not come to give you food, I came to give you Myself.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And that's what He means by when He says, "I am the bread of life." You're looking for bread
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   but I am the bread of life. So each one of the
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "I Am" statements that He gives in the book of John is to correct
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   a wrong thinking, a wrong hope that the nation of
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Israel was placing either upon food, upon power,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   upon their heritage, upon their law, upon the leaders of
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Israel, upon their religious system. So each one of these things He's
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   pounding and saying, "You have the wrong perspective of who I am and why I
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   came." So if you look at the "I Am" statements
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   it kind of grows. He kind of starts to pad off the "I am the bread of life."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   "I am the light of the world." "I am the good shepherd."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   "I am the resurrection." "I am the way and the truth and life." "Nobody comes to the Father
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   but through Me." You would think that of all
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   the "I Am" statements that if you're going to leave with
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   the final "I Am" statement that you would choose one of the bigger ones.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   "I am the resurrection and the life." I thought that would be a good place to end it.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And He said, "You're looking for life but I am the
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   resurrection and the life." And then He goes to the cross. Instead
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   you kind of see if you play music there's a thing called
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   crescendo and it kind of builds in anticipation and you almost think,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   "I am the resurrection and the life." And then the sixth one,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Me." It's almost a summary of all
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   the other five. And then the last one is, "I am
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   divine. You abide in Me. You want to bear fruit."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   It almost kind of seems anti-climactic, the seventh
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   "I Am" statement. And then He just kind of rides off. The reason
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   why the "I am divine" statement in John chapter 15
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   is the last one, all six of the "I Am" statements was
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   preparing them for the seventh one. And the reason
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   why is because He just told them He's about to leave. And
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   they're concerned. If you leave what about us? And He's
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   telling them, "Just as you were fine when I was here,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   after I leave you will be fine if you remain in Me.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   If you continue in Me." In other words, He's
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   preparing them for His departure. He was teaching
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   them throughout the ministry as they were distracted.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   They're thinking, "Oh man, the Messiah is going to come. He's going to overthrow the government.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   He's going to give us food." So everything that went wrong with the nation of Israel
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Jesus is going to fix. And so one by one systematically
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   He says, "No, your real problem is not the Romans. Your
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   real problem is not poverty. Your real problem is not lack of
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   leadership. Your real problem is not the religious system."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He was telling them, "Your real problem is sin. And I
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   am the answer to that sin." So after He
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   prepares them, He says, after He's described, "This is who I am.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I've come to forgive sin and restore you back onto My Father. I am the way
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and the truth and the life. No one can come to the Father but through Me.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But even though I am leaving, I'm not leaving you as an orphan.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   The Helper is going to come and you need to continue with Him
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   as you continued with Me." So John chapter 15 is really the
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   foundation of Christianity. Everything that you and I know
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   about what it means to be a Christian really is summed up in John chapter 15.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   He says, "You can't bear fruit.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Your desire to make disciples, plant churches, become a missionary,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   whatever it is that you have in your head, if you don't do this
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   you cannot bear fruit." Everything that
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   God has called us to do, the reason why He saved us, the reason why
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   we gathered together, the reason why I studied the Bible, if you don't do this, it
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   will only lead to frustration. It will feel like
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Romans chapter 7. Everything I want to do, I do
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   not do. What I do not want to do, I keep on doing. Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And you are left there to suffer. Oh, what a wretched man
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   that I am. And so you live the rest of your life. Oh, what a wretched man that I am.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   But you never get to, there is no condemnation
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   for those who are in Christ Jesus, for what the law could not do
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   weakened by the sinful flesh, God did by sending His Son.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   We never get to that part. So
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   the last "I am" statement, "I am the vine" is really the key
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   to everything that you and I are seeking in this
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Christian life. So how important is it that we understand
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   what Jesus is saying here? Absolutely crucial,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   absolutely essential. If you miss this, you miss everything about your Christian
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   life. Maybe part of the reason why we are frustrated is because we are not
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   practicing this.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Let's jump into what this means.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   The imperative in this passage in John chapter 15 isn't
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   bear fruit. Now I know he says if you do not bear
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   fruit, you are going to be cut down. There is judgment coming.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   If you do bear fruit, God is going to prune you so that you may bear more fruit. So well if that is the case,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   if bearing fruit identifies me as a Christian, I better go bear fruit.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   The imperative in this passage is not bear fruit. The imperative,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   the command in this passage is to abide. And you will
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   see that even though the word bear fruit, bear fruit keeps coming over and over again.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   The word that is repeated over and over for emphasis is the word abide.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   He mentions it 11 times in 16 verses.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   To abide. You have to abide in me. Abide in me. Abide in me. Abide in me.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So if abide is the key to Christian life,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   he says if you don't abide, first of all you are not a Christian,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   you can't bear fruit. Your prayers are frustrated. If you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   abide in me, my words abide in you. Ask whatever you wish. In other words if you are not
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   abiding in Christ, you can't bear fruit and your prayers are not going to go answered.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So how important is it that we are abiding in Christ?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's the foundation in which we build anything that we
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   do as a Christian. So we need to understand what does this word abide
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   mean? What does it mean to abide in Christ?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Some of your translations may have translated obey.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Some of your translations translated remain.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Some of your translations translated to abide.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Some of your translations translated continue. So if you
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   look at various translations, it translated that word slightly different.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   There's certain nuances that overlap, but some of it just kind of
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   says, "Oh, I can see these words are similar but different."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The reason why there's different words translated is because this is one of
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   those words that are, you know it's dynamic in translation
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   because there is nothing, one word that captures the essence of this
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   word. Just like you know if we really want
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   to dig and understand when the Bible uses the word love, you know
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   the Greek language is a very precise language.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   It has 27 different tenses and they use almost
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   all 27. You know in the English I heard from
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   what I learned was like 17 and we use like 4 or something. You know.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So Greek, I can understand God's wisdom and why He chose Greek because it is a very
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   specific, precise language. Even the way we use the word
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   love. I mean we have one love for love cat, love dog, love God, love
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   movies, love wife, love food. I mean it's the same word love.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   In the Greek obviously it is a little bit more precise the way they use the word
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   love. The word here abide in Greek is meno.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Now there is all kinds of ways that we could translate
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   it. It has similar meaning but there is three dynamic definitions
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   that I think will help us to understand when Jesus says if you want to bear fruit,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   if you want to be effective in prayer
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   you have to abide in me. Like what does that mean? There is three
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   understandings which I am going to briefly go over this morning. One is
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   the word abide, meno, basically means to continue.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   To continue, to remain. The second understanding
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   of the word is to rest, to rest.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   To rest in Christ. And then the third definition
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   understanding of this word is to rely.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Three R's.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It's to remain, it's to
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   what did I say? Remain
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   rest, okay. Remain, rest
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and rely. Okay, three R's. Remember that.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The first word to abide in Christ
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   means to continue or to remain in Christ.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   In Hebrews chapter 2, 1 it says, "Therefore we must pay much closer attention
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   to what we have heard lest we drift away from it."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Lest we drift away from it. The problems that
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   the readers of the Hebrews had was that they basically had spiritual
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   ADD. If you look at the book of Hebrews it goes over
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   the Christology. The primary reason why the author goes
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   over the Christology in the first 11 chapters is because
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   they took our eyes off of Christ. They weren't embracing
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   idolatry. They weren't deliberately denying Christ. They were just drifting.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And the constant encouragement, exhortation
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   is to stay focused on Christ. To remain.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   That the very thing that saved you is the very
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   thing that's going to sustain you. You know we kind of think like okay now
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   we've been justified by faith now we need to find another way to be sanctified.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   He says no, what justified you, the same power that justified
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   you is the same power that's going to sanctify you.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And so therefore he says to remain. You know
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   what happens is every time in every generation when we
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   sense a frustration, spiritual frustration that maybe
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   the church is not growing. Maybe we're not reaching this new generation.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   There's always these gatherings to try to figure out
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   the latest trend of how to reach the
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   younger people. Right now the big thing is millennials, which a lot of you guys are in that age
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   bracket. And there is a huge concern in the church in
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   our part of the world that the millennials are leaving.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And so they're afraid that if this trend continues
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   that we're not going to have a church. I remember this when I was in
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   college we went through the exact same thing. People were concerned there was a mass exodus.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   You know and if we don't do something that we're not going
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   to have the church next generation 30 years later we're still here. You know.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   But right now there's this big concern that we're losing the millennials and so
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   there's these gatherings. There's these conferences. Books being written.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And the reason the way to reach the millennials is to
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   be in the digital world. We need to be
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   more Facebook present. We need to learn Snapchat.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   You know our sermons have to be shorter. It needs to be this way. I need to dress
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   this way. Get rid of the suit. You know what I mean? And so you have all these things
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   because millennials feel uncomfortable. Maybe you feel uncomfortable because I'm wearing a suit today.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Right? Maybe get rid of this and more people will come. That's what they're telling me.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Over and over again every generation when we feel like there's spiritual
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   frustration there's a gathering together like maybe we need to change our technique.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Maybe the way things are organized it worked in the
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   previous generation but it doesn't work now so we need to change all this.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Never do I see anywhere in the scripture where it tells us
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   you know go but then you know you got to contextualize the message and you got to
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   find out where they are, where they came from, and how they connect and you got to do a
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   sociological study, a psychological study, and then find out how to
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   market the church and brand your name and everything that the world
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   uses to attract people to get them to buy their product the church is saying maybe
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   we need to embrace some of this stuff to get more people to come and to be interested in Christ.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   The Bible constantly warns us
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   To remain, to continue, to stay.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It frustrates me every time we say oh we're cutting edge. We got
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   cutting edge stuff. We're cutting edge this. You know what was cutting edge
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   five years ago is no longer cutting edge. It's dull and boring now. So we got to do another
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   cutting edge for the new generation. I see the scripture
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   over and over again reminding us, warning us
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   to stay focused on what saved you in the beginning. He says if you want to bear
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   fruit, he doesn't say find new techniques. He doesn't say
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   get a better degree. He says if you want to bear fruit
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   what does he say? Abide in me.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Abide in me. And I can tell you from my
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   personal experience, personal experience and from doing ministry
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   that any time there's ever been spiritual frustration
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   it is almost always, and I
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   don't think I'm exaggerating, it is almost always because at some
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   place in my life I'm not abiding in Christ. I've neglected
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   my time with God. I neglected prayer. I neglected being in the
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Word and I prioritized something else in my heart rather than
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Christ. And that's why he says I'm going to be leaving but the Holy Spirit
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   is going to come and you continue to remain in me.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   John 6.56 whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks on my blood abides
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   in me and I in him. He's talking about
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   what he did on the cross. Your strength is
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   going to come from abiding in him.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   1 John 2.19 he says they went out from us but they were
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   with us. But they went out that it might become plain
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   that they all are not of us. Persevere.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   He said they didn't leave because the church didn't find a new technique.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We didn't change according to time. You know the church wasn't
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   willing to adopt to the new generation. No they left because they were not
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   of us. If they were really of us the Gospel would have been
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   enough. Christ would have been enough.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Colossians 1.21 and you who once were alienated and hostile in mind
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   doing evil deeds he has now reconciled in his body of flesh the body of
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   his death in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   if indeed you continue in what? In the
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   faith. Stable and steadfast not shifting from the hope of the Gospel
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   that you heard. Preach the word in season
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and out of season. There's going to come a time when people are not going to put up with sound
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   doctrine but gather among themselves. We're going to tickle their itching ears.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   But you preach the word in season and out of season. Because the
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   only avenue that God has ordained to bear fruit
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   is to abide in Christ. To continue
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   in Christ. Continue in the Holy Spirit. If you have
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   ever entertained in your mind the reason why you are not
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   walking right with God is because you don't have this X, Y, and Z.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And if that X, Y, and Z is anything other than
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Christ that is not from God.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   If you think that your spiritual life is frustrated because
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   you don't have a mentor that's not from Christ.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Now is it unbiblical? Of course not.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   But God did not say the reason why
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   you're not walking with God is because I didn't place enough mature Christians around
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   you and that's why you're not growing. So the rest of your life it's his fault.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   The only thing that he has ordained for you to bear
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   fruit is for you and I to abide in Christ.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Now does having other Christians around us help us?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Encourage us? Yes. But that can never be the excuse because that's
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   not what God ordained. If you've entertained anything
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   maybe if we were organized a certain way. Maybe if I had this kind of Bible.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Maybe if I had this kind of small group. If you
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   put anything between me and Christ other than
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Christ himself you've made whatever you put in that
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   an idol. He says if you
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   want to bear fruit he didn't say go find people. Go find a certain
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   organization. He said no if you want to abide in me if you want to bear fruit abide
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   in me. Abide in me. Now people who are
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   abiding in Christ obviously will benefit from all the other things. There's nothing
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   unbiblical about any of that stuff.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   But anytime you put anything as a necessity
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   for your spiritual growth other than Christ
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   that's not from God.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He says you need to continue. Second thing is he says you need to
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   rest. The word abide meno means to rest.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And that's why Jesus when he calls people he says come to me all who are weary and
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   heavy laden and I will give you rest. We've talked so much about
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   this in the past sermons about how that idea of rest Sabbath
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   is not just talking about just resting physically.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Right? I know you guys can sit and rest
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   just quit work and rest for the next five days do nothing but watch movies.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   At the end of five days do you feel rested? You probably feel more restless.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Right? Because the rest the Sabbath that the Bible talks about
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   is not from physical fatigue. God did not rest
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   after six days of creation and say whew we need to recuperate.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Right? Because he's immutable. He's
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   never changing. His power is never weakened.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So his Sabbath that he's talking about is the rest
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   from work and did Adam and Eve work before the fall? Yes.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   God called them to be fruitful and multiply and subdue the land. That's exactly what they were doing
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   before they fell. They were resting in him.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   The difference between laboring while you're resting
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and laboring
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   when your heart is at unrest. Somebody who was laboring
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   while your heart is unrest no matter what you do it creates just more frustration.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   It creates more frustration because your motive
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   is you're trying to do something to appease God to earn his favor.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And if that's the motivation behind what you're doing it only causes
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   more restlessness. When he uses the word if you want
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   to bear fruit you need to first and foremost rest. In Hebrews chapter 4
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   1. "Therefore while the promise of entering his rest still stands let us
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it." So then there
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God for whoever has entered God's rest
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   has also rested from his works as God did from his. Remember how he
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   describes the rest as God resting?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Is God resting because he's tired? No he's not resting
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   because he's tired. He said after he created everything everything was good.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Everything was good. When everything is the way
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   it was supposed to be there's a sense of peace. Those of you who are
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   what do you call it OCD
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   you guys know that if you walk into a house and the house is messy there's no rest
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   because it's not in order. Those of you who are not OCD have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Right? You're not at rest because things aren't the way
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   you think it ought to be. And that's the kind of rest
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   he's talking about where what God had intended had fallen apart
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   because of sin. And so the rest that he's bringing back is
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   to put back what God intended in creation.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Whether it is the role of a man or a woman, our sexuality,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   our homes, our church, our goals, sex
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   all of these things that have gone out of whack. To bring that
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   back into order is to bring back the Sabbath
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   to rest. There is unrest when things
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   are out of whack. So when Christ came and redeemed us
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   it is to bring back what was lost, this unrest.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   The greatest thing that causes
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   rest in a life of a Christian is his
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   forgiveness. His love.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   The very first thing that you need to embrace and believe with all
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   your heart is when you confess your sins he is faithful and just to
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   forgive you of all your unrighteousness. And if you are
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   living your life thinking somehow you're going to earn that back. That when
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I'm right with God I can come to the communion table. When I'm right with God I'll start
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   doing this. When I'm right with God I'll start serving. And there's something
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   inside of you that wants to earn his grace.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And all it's doing is causing greater and greater
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   restlessness in your heart. If you want to bear fruit he says
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   first and foremost you have to learn to rest in him.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   That I have been complete. That he's not simply a judge
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   who forgave me of my sins. He's our Abba Father that I
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   call him my dad.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   You know in Philippians 127 Paul says let your manner of
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   life be worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   What a burden. If you read that the wrong way
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   that's a tremendous burden.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   What does it mean to live worthy of the gospel? Worthy of the blood
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   of Jesus Christ. Go do it.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   What can you possibly do today that's going to make you
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ? I mean you're talking about a burden.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   If you hear that the wrong way
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   it'll sound like get your ass straight before you come to him and
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   be worthy of the gospel. It's a contradiction of the gospel itself.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   There is a world of difference between somebody
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   who is pursuing righteousness because he has been made righteous
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   versus somebody who is pursuing righteousness trying to be righteous.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   There's a world of difference. And that's why he says
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   again Ephesians 4 1-3. Three chapters
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   three chapters of revelation of teaching us of the depth of the
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   love of Christ. How he pursued sinners.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And then in chapter 4, therefore a prisoner of the Lord
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Walk worthy. Not to be
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   worthy but because you've been made worthy by the blood of Christ.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   See unless our hearts are at rest we can't
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   bear fruit. Unless we have confidence
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   that the throne that we're entering is not the judge
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   but our Abba Father. We will never feel comfortable entering into his
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   room. We'll always be groveling.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   You know what's interesting is John, 1 John
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   writes and he basically says if you're living in darkness you know you fool yourself
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   God is light and there is no fellowship and you're making him out to be a liar and he says
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   boom he brings down a hammer. But in 1 John
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   chapter 2 he says the reason I'm writing to you
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   right, 1 John chapter 2 verses 12-14
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   he writes to different groups of people and listen carefully to what he says.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And this is after he just brought down the hammer in chapter 1. In chapter 1 it says
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   if you're walking in darkness you're probably not a Christian.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Now a Christian stumbles in sin but you're not living in sin and boom brings down the hammer.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   But in chapter 2 verse 12 he says I am writing to you little
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   children. I'm saying all of this to you because your sins are forgiven
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   for his name's sake. I'm not saying this so that you can
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   earn your forgiveness. I'm saying this because your sins are already forgiven.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Verse 13 I am writing to you fathers because you know him
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   who is from the beginning. I'm not writing this to you so
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   pursue him so that you can earn this. I'm writing and I'm saying these things to you
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   because you already know him. I am writing to you young men
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   because you have overcome the evil one. You've already overcome
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   that's why I'm writing this to you. I write to you children because you know the
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Father. He gives assurance after he says boom you can't
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   live in darkness and call him your father. But he says but the reason why I'm even saying
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   this to you is because you are children of God. Verse 14 I write to you
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   fathers because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you young men
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   the evil one. And he gives absolute assurance to these people that
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   he just hammered. Why is he doing that?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Because the reason why he was writing this letter is
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   to prune them and strengthen them. He's to prune
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   them and strengthen them. He said he who does not bear any fruit he'll be chopped down
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   and he'll be burned. But those who bear fruit however little it may be if you're a child of God
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   he will prune you. He said I'm writing these things to you and I'm
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   warning you because you're a child of God. So
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   what brings rest to a Christian is the
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   confidence that your sins are forgiven. Your sins are
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   forgiven. When you came before the Lord in all honesty and asked for forgiveness
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   and God said I forgave you. And when he says it is finished
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   it is finished. It's no longer
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   our job to strive but to live up to what he has already given.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Second. Third abiding in Christ means
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   to rely on Christ. To depend on Christ.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   As I said before anything that we place between us
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and Jesus that I need this for my spiritual walk with God
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   you've placed something else where only
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Christ is supposed to sit.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   If you say you can't walk passionately for Christ because I lack
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   these things then those things have become our idol.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   We become dependent on those things. Anytime
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   when we start talking again it frustrates me sometimes when I
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   see the gatherings of pastors talking about new techniques
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and why we need this and we need more finance, we need more organization, we need to do this
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and yet when I look at scripture Jesus and
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   God deliberately goes the exact opposite direction.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   His choosing of the 12 disciples made no sense.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   The way he conquered Jericho
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   makes absolutely no sense. Why he even chose
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   the nation of Israel makes absolutely no sense.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   He said I'm not choosing you because you're great I'm choosing you because of the sins and basically
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   sovereignly chose him to display his glory.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   In every instance God chooses somebody. He said Paul the reason why
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   he chose me is because I'm the worst of sinners. He doesn't say God chose me
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   because I was a Pharisee and I kind of know the law.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Anytime we study the apostle Paul and why God chose him we always look from our human
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   perspective. Oh he had Roman citizenship so it was easier for him to go
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   from place to place. Because that's what we value.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   That's what we think. That's why we think that apostle Paul was
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   successful. Oh he's highly educated. He has Roman citizenship.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   He was already well known to every city he went. People already knew who he was.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He must have been very articulate. He was a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   As to the law he was perfect. A tribe of Benjamin. So anywhere he went
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   to the synagogue and he decided to speak people showed respect. That's why
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   he must have been chosen. That's why he must have been
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   able to bear fruit. And yet Paul says the very
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   reason why he was chosen is because he was the worst of sinners.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Humanly speaking he was the worst person. He was the
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   worst person. He hated Jesus. He was willing to kill anybody else
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   who was proclaiming Jesus. Why did he choose him? To display
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   his glory not his. Not Paul's.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   How much of
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   our what we think is effective is
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   completely unbiblical.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Where God in history is seeking his glory.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And how much of what we use as an excuse of why certain
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   things aren't happening is nothing more than a
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   practice of Romans chapter 1. Giving glory
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   to the creation rather than the Creator. You know
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   the greatest blessing of being a Christian or of salvation
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   is Jesus Himself.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   It's Jesus Himself. That's why He says,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   that's why He says in John chapter 15, 7,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   "If you abide in Me, My words abide in you. Ask whatever you wish and it shall be done for you."
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Isn't that
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   the greatest benefit of being a Christian?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   I mean if I needed to get
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   a loan, right, the greatest benefit
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   is not like, "Oh you know what Chase Bank is moving next door."
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   "Ooo they're next door." You know what I mean?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   They used to close at 5. I get a work for kids 6 and they open at
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   they open till 7. Yes! You know
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Chase, they got billions of dollars and they're moving close.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   As foolish as that may sound, that's what we celebrate sometimes.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   The benefit of a Christian is
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   not that we have a close proximity to the bank.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   The benefit of Christian living is that our Father is a billionaire.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   That bank exists for my Father.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Not my Father for that bank.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And so our confidence often times comes from what we see.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And it is ridiculous for us to think, "Oh you know, if we just had
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   more people with certain personalities, certain education, and if we were
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   just smart enough, if we had more money."
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And the thing that trips us up more than anything else are the very things that you
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   happen to be good at. That's what
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   trips you up the most. If you're smart, your intellect
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   is getting in the way from coming to Christ.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Because you think that by your smart, somehow
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   you're going to add to the kingdom. If you happen to be a physical
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   strong-willed person, whatever you set
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   your mind on, "I do." That's
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   getting in the way of tapping into His power.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Anything that you think is somehow
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   going to add to bearing fruit outside of Christ is getting in the
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   way. He says the only way you're going to bear fruit
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   is to rely upon Him. That's why Peter
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   when Jesus was about to go to the cross, He says,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "Where I'm going you cannot come." Peter said to Him, "Lord, where can I, why can I
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   not follow You? I will lay down my life for You." Peter meant it
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   absolutely. Sometimes people just say things.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Every once in a while I hear somebody say, "I'll take a bullet for you. I don't believe you."
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   You know?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Maybe I'm just cynical. Every once in a while somebody
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   was like, "Oh, somebody threw a grenade." And you hear stories of a soldier who jumped
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   on top of it and took it for the rest of the team. And then it makes the big news.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Right? He gets a medal. His family meets the president.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And the reason why that happens is because it's that rare.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   If that's the instinct of every soldier, they wouldn't
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   be meeting the president. The reason they meet the president is because
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   it's so out of character. Because our natural nature is not
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   that. Right? But Peter
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I believe meant it. "I will lay down my life for you."
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   If you know anything about Peter, Peter is the guy who, he's the guy
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   like, Jesus walks on water. He's like, "Is that you?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Oh, let me come." Right? Everybody else is like, "What are you doing?"
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Peter went. "If I drown, I drown." Right?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   So I think my picture of Peter is kind of
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   like Esau. You know what I mean? Like Jacob's the slippery one.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And he's always kind of like, "How can I get his soup?" You know?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Or not the soup, but the birthright. And he's always conniving.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Right?
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Esau's the guy who went hunting. He's a burly man. That's how I see Peter. Peter's the
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   full-time fisherman. I'm assuming his
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   hands are all calloused. And he's a burly guy.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And he's confident. He might be the oldest and toughest guy there.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And he's weaklings. Yeah. He's computer nerds. They're not going to
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   They're not going to follow you.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Right? Did I offend some people?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Don't write my email, okay? I already know.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   He's that mountain guy who
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   chops down trees. He's like, "I'm going to do it." Because he actually does it. Remember when the
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   temple guards come? Right? When the temple guards come, everybody else
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   is kind of, "What's going on?" Peter actually takes out his little sword and goes, "Bam!"
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Right? He's the only one. He misses.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Right? Jesus said, "What are you doing?" He puts the ear back on.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   [laughter] He actually does it.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Peter was a man of his word. He did it. Right?
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   But Jesus answers him, "Will you lay down your life for me?"
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   It's a rhetorical question. Meaning, Peter, you don't even know yourself.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   You don't even know yourself.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   You're going to deny me three times before the rooster crows.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   All this time I've been loyal to you. Why would you say that? I know these guys.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   But not me. You know me.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Jesus knows us better than we know
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   ourselves. Right? And that's why the Bible
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   says, "He who thinks he stands, be careful, because that's when you fall."
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   When you let your guard down, thinking that, "You know what? I have enough experience.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   I have so much experience. I've been a Christian for this long. I've led
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   small groups. I've gone on missions. And I've done this and I've done that." He says, "Be careful.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Be careful, because that's when you'll fall."
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   See, the greatest gift that you and I
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   have been given is our connection with Christ.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   The greatest power to bear fruit is Christ.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   The greatest strategy to plant churches is Christ.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   The greatest method to bring
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   lost sinners to Jesus is Christ.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   And we constantly think, "Oh, I haven't been trained enough. I haven't gone to school.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   I don't have an MDiv. I don't have a doctorate. I don't have this. I don't have enough experience."
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   But Jesus said one thing.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   He didn't say, "You know what? Let's take a class. Let's go to three years or go to the mountain
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   and I'll show you how to bear fruit." He said one thing.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   If you want to bear fruit, stick with me.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Stick with me. If you want to bear fruit,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   stay with me. Rest in me.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Rely upon me. He said one thing.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Think how complicated Christianity has become in our generation.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Think how complicated we make
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   everything. When all Jesus did,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   think of how many of you were from noble backgrounds. How many of you were wise.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   How many of you were noble. In other words, none of you.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   God chose what was weak for what purpose?
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   To demonstrate His power. So why are we trying to be so
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   smart? When He told us one thing.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Every frustration that you and I experience
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   as a Christian is because we've taken our eyes off of Christ.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Let me conclude with this. John 15, 16.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   "You did not choose me. I chose you and appointed you
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   that you should go and bear fruit. That your fruit should abide
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, He may give it to you."
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   The greatest resource that you and I have
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   is not the great men of our generation. It's not
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   the schools. It's not the experienced men. It's not the knowledge. It's not older people
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   or younger people. It's not the quality of worship or the songs that we
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   pick or how certain things are organized or talent or any of that.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   The greatest resource that you and I have is that
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   we're able to come to our Abba Father and ask
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Him to get involved. Ask Him to get involved.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   So when we bear fruit, that everybody will know
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   it wasn't us. It wasn't us.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   It was Him. It was Him.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   That's what He's seeking. He's seeking His glory in us
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   and the person that He will use the most are the one who's emptied.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   And when He works, people will know that it was Him.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   If you want to bear fruit, abide.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Stay with Him. Rely on Him and rest in Him.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Let's pray. And as our
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   service team comes up, let's take some time to reflect and to pray.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   And I know
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   the solution is really simple.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Practice is difficult.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Let's not complicate the solution. Like we don't know what to do.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   We know exactly what to do. We need to come to
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   Christ. We need to depend on Him. We need to cry out to Him.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   The difficult part is wrestling with our flesh.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   But what to do, we know what to do. We need to humble ourselves.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   We need to cry out to Him. We need to prioritize abiding
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   in Him. Let's take some time to come before the Lord as we have our worship
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   team lead us.
