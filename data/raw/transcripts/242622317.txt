[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Today, I ask our guest speaker to come and cover for me this morning.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.760]   Pastor Nate Quack, he is presently serving at Good Steward Church, and he's a brother
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.320]   that we've had contact with for a while, and he's a brother that, again, is a like-minded
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   brother.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.640]   And our youth group actually went to several retreats together with their church, and so
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.160]   we participated and had a relationship with him for a while.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.120]   So he comes to us with his wife, Kazeah, and they have two young children, Addy and Hudson.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.400]   And so they are here with us, and so they are somewhere, somewhere that you're, they
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   were in the first service, I don't know where they are now, but if you see them, say hi
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   to them.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.760]   But Pastor Nate is a, again, an encouraging brother.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.240]   We were able to have lunch several times, and getting to know him, and he's, again,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.160]   like I said, he's a very like-minded brother, and so we asked him to come and share God's
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.320]   word with us this morning.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.520]   So let's welcome him.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.520]   It's good to see all of you, and as Pastor Peter said, thank you for inviting me.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.920]   I'm Nathan Kwok, and I come from Good Stewards Church.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.800]   It's a church that I've been pastoring at for about the last eight years or so, ten
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.440]   years as an intern, and I've been there for all my life, pretty much.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.160]   I grew up at that church, and you know, I've heard lots of things about Berean.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.360]   This is the first time I'm actually here on a Sunday, and I've preached at a college
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   retreat last year, and so if you remember me, please come and say hi.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.120]   I most likely won't remember your name, but I do want to get to know you again and things
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120]   like that.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.920]   So again, thank you guys for inviting me.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.040]   I graduated from UCSD, about four years of colleging there from 2004 to 2008, and then
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.200]   I moved back here to this area.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.400]   I grew up in La Palma, California right there, and yeah, UCSD, I've been meeting a lot of
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.760]   people from UCI here.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.040]   I feel like this place is covered with UCI students, so we all know UCSD is the best
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   college in San Diego.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.880]   And you know, I just want to remind you guys that there are other places outside, so again,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   thank you.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.600]   Well, today we're going to be covering a topic.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.960]   It's a random topic.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.200]   It's a topic that's close to my heart recently because of something my daughter has been
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.600]   going through, and because of that, I've not only been seeing my daughter's heart, but
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.960]   I've also been seeing my own heart reflected in her.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.920]   So if you could turn with me to Philippians chapter 2, verse 14.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.960]   This is the passage we're going to be covering today.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   Philippians chapter 2, verse 14.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:06.680]   And we're going to be reading through 16.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.720]   Do all things without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.240]   of God, without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.040]   you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.280]   of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.180]   Would you bow your heads with me as we pray?
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.320]   God of heaven, we declare to you your majesty and might.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.560]   God, you are God above, you're second to none.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.240]   There is no one like you.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.840]   And Father, your words are the ones that we're pouring over this morning.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.720]   Father, may we not take it lightly.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   Would it be something that we draw to our heart and hide it?
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.240]   Help us, God, to remember that this is not just some philosophy, and it's not just the
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   Bible.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.560]   God, these are words of life.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   This is our bread, this is the thing by which we live.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.760]   So God, draw all of our hearts open, mine included, that we might be changed by your
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   word.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.980]   Well today we're gonna be addressing the topic of complaining, and that's why it came to
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.760]   my attention, and I was trying to think through, like, how do I take our daughter Addie through
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   this?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.160]   And so this is why I started actually looking into this passage, and then it grew and grew,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.440]   and it made me realize how prevalent it is, not in just my own heart, but we already know
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.680]   this, but it's prevalent in our society.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.200]   And we see it all over the place.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.760]   I don't think I need to preach it here, but we see it all around us, a grumbling heart
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.320]   that is almost just permeating throughout all of society.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.040]   We know that social media is something that has really, really done a work on this, because
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.240]   never in all of history has there been a place where you had a forum or a platform where
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.360]   just a blink of an eye you can make your complaint known to thousands of people.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.600]   But we see it all over.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.040]   Also in our companies, we see it in our HR departments, we see it in complaint departments,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.520]   and it's easy to be critical, and so easy to justify our complainings.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.000]   We almost feel right in it.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.560]   Society is almost preaching that to us.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.120]   It is your right.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.700]   You are always right.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.000]   And so we must make our voice heard.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   It's been so much easier also to compare ourselves and our situations with others.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.460]   So you can see even the complaining hearts that begin to arise as you listen to other
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.800]   sermons on radios or online.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.240]   We have access to the greatest preachers around the world, and so it can be easy to complain
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.680]   about your own pastors and about your own leaders.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.440]   There's so many things we complain about.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.240]   We can complain about it, that everyone else in the world, it seems like they're traveling.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.640]   Why is everyone in France?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   Why is everyone in New York?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   Why is everyone doing these things?
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.760]   Why does it seem like everybody has a Disneyland pass?
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.200]   Oh, is that true here?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.720]   Why does it seem like everybody has tried that new eatery across the street?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   Well, this passage today, the surrounding context shows, and this book of Philippians
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.680]   about this theme of humbly rejoicing in the midst of suffering through the example of
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.800]   Christ.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.960]   It's about rejoicing in suffering.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   There is no place for grumbling and disputing in a place like this.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:58.040]   And Paul writes this from prison, a place where maybe grumbling and complaining rules.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.200]   He has just concluded his exhortation to the church of Philippi, asking them to be unified
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.520]   in heart and mind, given the humble example of Christ.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.600]   And in light of that, if you look just a passage up in verse 12 through 13, Paul is saying
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.800]   there to work on your own salvation in light of Jesus and the unity we're called to in
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   him.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.720]   That we're called to work on our faith and sanctification, and that not grumbling, not
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.120]   disputing is the natural outflowing of that.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.580]   We're going to go through four points today.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.760]   The first is the command.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.560]   The command, that command is don't complain.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.040]   The second is the why, which is you are children of God.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   Whenever a command is given, our rebellious hearts' natural reaction is we question why.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   Well, this is the first why.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.920]   And then the second why is point three, you are to shine as lights in the world.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   And fourthly is the how.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   How do we do this?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.240]   It's by holding fast to Scripture's life-giving words.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.860]   So the first point is don't complain.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.560]   And can't get any more simple than that.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   Don't complain.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.200]   Look down with me at chapter 2, verse 14 there.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.120]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.720]   Now, the command says do this.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.760]   You've probably been told this a myriad of times before, but we've probably again forgotten
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.520]   that when someone gives a command, if an authority gives a command, it is not an option.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.960]   The expectation is for you to comply.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.540]   You hear, you listen, and you obey the command.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.600]   If you're a part of an army in war and a general gives you a command, it's not an option.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.920]   You don't sit there and say, "No, not for me.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   No thank you."
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:52.720]   And more than that, you can't even say like, "Oh no, can you just give me a second?"
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.320]   No, actually the greater the authority, the greater the power, the faster you're expected,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.480]   the more with more urgency you're expected to follow that command.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.560]   And this is a command given through the Word of God, through an apostle of God.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Do this.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Don't complain.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960]   Don't grumble.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.280]   Don't dispute.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.080]   It isn't optional.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.680]   So what is the command here?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.480]   Well, the command is that in all things, you are to do them without grumbling or disputing.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.160]   By the way, I'm going to be using today grumbling and disputing and complaining kind of very
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.760]   synonymously because I believe that the thought is similar.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.600]   And basically, this is a command to us to, in a nutshell, it's about complaining.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760]   And it says it, to not do it in anything.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.040]   There are no caveats.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.600]   There are no conditions given to this command.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.240]   It says to do it.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.640]   There is no time and place in our life where it's okay for us to complain.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.320]   In the verses before, this is specific to our faith.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   As we're working out our salvation, that is, as we're being sanctified, and maybe even
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.880]   as we're being persecuted for it, as our faith is being tested and stretched, there is going
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.440]   to be a natural temptation there to grumble and dispute against other people and against
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.400]   our God.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.680]   But Paul makes it crystal clear, do them without grumbling or disputing.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.100]   Now some of us might be thinking, shouldn't we speak up at certain times?
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.600]   If there is injustice or unfairness happening, should we not speak up?
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.540]   Should we not open our mouths and speak the truth, and you would be right?
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.640]   But that would be something like defending or reasoning or rebuking or exhorting.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.260]   We are still called never to do it with a grumbling and complaining of heart.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.240]   There is no time or place in our lives where it's okay.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.640]   I mean, we're getting this command from the Apostle Paul.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.480]   This guy is an incredible man of God.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.240]   If we should be listening to a command, maybe it should be from this guy.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.800]   God speaks through him and gives this command to us.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.480]   But Paul, he doesn't lord over the Philippians, telling them, "You should do this," and he
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.160]   just goes and does whatever he wants.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.400]   He's living it out.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.800]   Remember where he is.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.280]   He's in prison.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.720]   He had actually just gone through this thing.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   In Acts 16, it talks about this account of Paul in Philippi.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.360]   Maybe some of these church members that are receiving this letter were a part of that
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   congregation around that time.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.480]   That Paul exercises the spirit out of this girl.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.540]   And after he does that, because the crowd, they go crazy on him and they start beating
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.040]   him and throwing stuff at him, Paul is brought before the magistrate, and they strip him
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   down and they beat him some more with rods.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.640]   So Paul and company, they're beaten, they're bruised, they're probably, you know, so sad.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   They're taken into the inner dungeon, the lower dungeon, and they're shackled to the
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   wall.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.920]   And the lower dungeon is the place where it smells, it's raining, because this is a horrible
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.280]   place to be.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   The worst of prisoners were sent down to this kind of place.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:07.400]   They can't move, they're not eating well, and they're surrounded by people who are grumbling
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.840]   and complaining.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.440]   Man, this passage sometimes frustrates me, because I ask Paul, "How can you do this?"
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   In Acts 16.25, it says this about Paul and Silas.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.600]   About midnight, they were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   to them.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   And they couldn't believe this guy.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:35.080]   A guy like this, in a situation like this, is singing.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.640]   And this is the very guy who's telling Philippians, "Don't grumble or complain about anything."
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.600]   Man, doesn't that make your head hang in shame?
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   If anyone, this guy should be complaining.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.680]   How can we have the gall to complain about anything?
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.920]   Now let's look at these two words, grumbling and disputing.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.200]   The first word, grumbling, it's to express one's discontent.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.440]   That is, in grumbling, you are showing that your heart is not satisfied.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.840]   You're not content with your life, with the way things are going.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.400]   Later on in Philippians 4, verses 11 through 12.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.120]   If you want, you can flip just a page over.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.920]   Philippians 4, 11 through 12.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.360]   Paul says this, "Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.280]   situation I am to be content.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   I know how to be brought low.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.440]   I know how to abound.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.320]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   and need."
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.600]   See, grumbling and disputing and complaining is the exact opposite of where we're called
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.920]   to be as Christians.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.320]   Grumbling doesn't only show discontent, but there's something about this word that brings
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.960]   out this idea of murmuring, of whispering, of mumbling.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.080]   It's a secret displeasure.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.840]   Some of you might know what I mean.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.800]   I'm a parent of a child that's three years old.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.440]   Again, Addie, that's her name.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.640]   I'm beginning to hear it all the time.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.200]   About six months ago, Addie, she got a new favorite word.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.000]   And I really wanted that favorite word to be something like, "Yes, Daddy," or "Thank
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.660]   you," or "I'm sorry," or something like that, right?
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.240]   But that word she learned was "Why?"
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.480]   Why, why, why?
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.160]   At first, it was cute.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.960]   At first, it was fresh and exciting for me.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   "Come, come to me.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.480]   I'll tell you why.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.240]   My goodness, you're talking.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.120]   Let me explain to you the world."
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.760]   It didn't take long for her sinfulness to start coming out through that word.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   And it wasn't just a trickle.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:48.260]   It was just an eruption of discontent and of sin.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.940]   "Why, Mommy?
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.380]   Why, Daddy?"
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.380]   Never content.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.380]   We'd say, "Finish your plate, Addie."
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.380]   And she would say, "Why?"
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.580]   I'd say, "Oh, because it's good for you, and we're giving you good food to eat, and you're
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.580]   going to be hungry later."
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   She'd say, "Okay."
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.860]   "Addie, why aren't you eating your food?"
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.020]   She says, "Why?"
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.140]   Drove us up the wall.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.900]   Just because that heart was so discontent.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.380]   Her heart wanted what she wanted.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.260]   It questioned whatever else anyone else wanted.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.020]   And like that last question, sometimes it wouldn't even make sense.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.700]   She just wanted to say, "Why?"
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.340]   So we began to teach Addie that she doesn't need to ask why in everything.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.640]   And we're trying to do what's best for her because we love her.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.220]   And that God commands children to obey their parents.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.580]   So that's when the quiet grumbling started happening.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.060]   "What'd you say, Addie?"
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.060]   She said, "Nothing."
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.500]   "Man, so small.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   How did you learn?
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   Where'd you learn that?"
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.220]   "Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, whisper, whisper, mumble, mumble, mumble in the heart."
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.500]   It shouldn't be this difficult to eat a few more bites of food.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.620]   We would portion it out and say, "You just have to finish one, two, three, four more
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.220]   bites," and it became like World War III.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.620]   Why?
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:14.220]   Finally, we got her to finish the food, and you can see it written all over her face.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.060]   You can see she was so complaintative in her heart.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.180]   You see, it says something about our hearts.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.380]   Would it really have been that difficult to stick a couple more bites in the mouth?
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.380]   No.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   It was not about the food anymore.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.260]   It was a sickness of the heart.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.300]   It's a type of faithlessness where you don't believe that the person is telling you to
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.340]   do what is good for you.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.620]   It's a type of rebellion where you want to do what you want to do regardless of what's
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620]   best.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.060]   It's a deep and inward selfishness where our eyes are pointed inwards, looking at our own
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.300]   frustrations and desires and our wants.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.420]   Now when this is one person, it's frustrating.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.500]   Now get a bunch of these people together, and it could be downright terrifying.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.780]   It was happening in the Philippians church when grumbling, with this grumbling came disunity
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.180]   and a spirit of competition that was disruptive to this church.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.860]   We see it in Philippians 1, verse 15, that people were in rivalry against each other
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.460]   for the gospel cause.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.020]   All through chapters 1 and 2, Paul keeps reminding them, "Be unified in heart.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.220]   Be unified in spirit.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.220]   Walk side by side.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.500]   Strive for the same thing.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.140]   Have the mind of Christ who was humble to show that example to us."
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.980]   It shows that something was going on in this church.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.460]   In chapter 4, verse 2, it actually names two people, which is kind of sad.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   You owe it to Yancintiq.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:40.140]   He says, "Have them agree with each other because they were disagreeing."
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.140]   With grumbling comes a second word, disputing, which is basically along the same vein, but
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.160]   it's the idea of giving your thoughts, your opinions, your ideas, your heart, meaning
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.980]   that you want your way to happen.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.620]   Disputes when your ideas and thoughts clash with other people's.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.660]   At the heart of this, just like grumbling, is rooted in rebellion, selfishness, and self-centeredness.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.260]   Now, again, this is a command to the church.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.620]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.020]   All things is what it says.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.940]   This is all-encompassing, all-expansive phrase.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.980]   There is no situation you can ever find yourself in your life, no matter how small or how huge,
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.340]   where grumbling and disputing is okay.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   Again I want to draw our attention to Paul and what he had already been through.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:33.620]   In 2 Corinthians 11, verse 23-27, he says this, "I am talking like a madman, with far
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.820]   greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings and often near death.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.680]   Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes, less one.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.780]   Three times I was beaten with rods.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.980]   Once I was stoned.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.260]   Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.620]   A night and a day I was adrift at sea.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.660]   On frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.500]   danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   from false brothers, in toil and hardship through many a sleepless night, in hunger
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.220]   and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure."
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.340]   Even in this, Paul is saying, "Do all things without grumbling and disputing."
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.620]   And now don't think for an instant that this was easy for Paul just because he was an apostle
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.460]   or because it was Paul.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.180]   This was hard for him.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.780]   And yet I know that even after he wrote this to the Philippians, he would preach this to
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.940]   himself all the time.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.420]   This leads us to a question then.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.340]   Are you a person marked by grumbling and disputing?
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.380]   Are you a person marked by complaining?
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.260]   And this doesn't need to always be an outward physical thing or a voice thing.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.140]   What about in the depths of our hearts?
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.900]   Are you a person marked by this?
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.060]   And there are so many things we complain about, don't we?
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.340]   And one of the easiest things that just shows the outward expression of our complaining
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.580]   hearts is traffic.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.660]   It's such an easy sermon illustration to use.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.260]   I'm sure you've heard these things all the time.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.940]   I remember this one time I was supposed to be there somewhere by 11 a.m. and a type of
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.820]   personality where if I'm not there by that time, I get really nervous, I get really frustrated
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   and things like that.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:23.660]   There was traffic and I remember complaining, "Why is there traffic at 11 a.m. in the morning?"
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.820]   I remember that day so vividly because I journaled at the end of the day.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.100]   My heart, I felt so wicked.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.140]   But I remember everything about it.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.540]   There was this car that was in front of me that was so slow in traffic that like six
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.180]   or seven cars cut into my lane.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.700]   I felt like I was going backwards.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.700]   I was so frustrated.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.500]   I remember passing by the two cars that had gotten in collision.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.220]   I remember complaining against them.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.700]   "Because of you guys and your reckless driving."
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.660]   Days are ruined.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.340]   I'm just like, "I'm thinking about myself."
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.980]   So much stuff about traffic.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.060]   Everyone and everything made me complain.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.500]   We complain about it when we get stopped at like three red lights in a row.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   Every red light.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   Why does this always happen to me?
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.860]   I don't drive too often in Irvine, but I noticed that about Irvine.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.940]   There are no smart lights in Irvine.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.620]   You get stopped at a light and then it's just red even though there's no cars coming in
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.500]   the other directions until it turns green.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.540]   I remember I went to my sister's house and then I was the first car to get stuck at the
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.540]   red and we were there for like seven minutes or something.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.220]   Complaining.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.220]   We complain when the car in front of us stops so suddenly that our coffee spills.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.780]   We complain when things don't go our way in the morning.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.220]   When one of our grocery bags rip open at the bottom.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.980]   When our phones freeze.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.700]   When our parents ask for help about how to send a photo again.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.080]   When we get to the dryer and our clothes aren't dry and now it smells like a rag.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.700]   When our kids stop every two seconds distracted by something on the way to what they're supposed
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.700]   to be doing.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.740]   We complain when one of the coaches of the Dodgers pulls a starting pitcher too quickly.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.540]   We complain when it's supposed to be our wind down time at the end of the day and someone
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.540]   interrupts it.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.020]   We complain when our roommates leave their dishes again.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.100]   We complain when a coworker won't get the hint and keeps standing next to our table
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.880]   talking and talking and talking.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.060]   We complain when we're asked to cover another person's shift.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.240]   We complain when in basketball that ball hawk keeps chucking up shots when I'm wide open.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.820]   We complain when we get to McDonald's at 10 p.m. and for some reason the line, the drive-thru
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.660]   line is going around the building.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.660]   We complain when it's too cold, when it's too hot, when it's too sunny, when it's too
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.660]   rainy.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.600]   We complain about the liberal leftist, the hard-headed rightist.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.700]   We complain about the president.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.980]   We complain about policies, procedures.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:48.060]   All over our lives, deep in our hearts, rooted there.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.940]   Are you a person marked by complaining, grumbling, disputing?
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:59.780]   Do you realize that it's a command given by God himself to all things without grumbling
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.780]   or disputing?
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:08.580]   And we love to go, "But this guy, but this situation, but you, God."
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.660]   And we point our fingers everywhere.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.060]   If this begins to root in our hearts, if it becomes habitual for us to complain, then
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:26.380]   it's only a matter of time before this kind of thing creates disunity amongst the church.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.780]   Grumbling and disputing does something to our hearts to create an environment where
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.980]   selfishness, self-centeredness, rebellion, and discontent thrives.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.700]   And if in our hearts this is happening, it's very easy for it to happen against each other.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.460]   This word grumbling is used three other times in the New Testament.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.820]   It's found in John 7, 12, Acts 6, 1, 1 Peter 4, 9, and each time it's grumbling towards
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.660]   others that create some kind of disunity.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.740]   Commentator Peter O'Brien says, "Grumblings promote ill will instead of harmony within
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.740]   the church.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.300]   Grumblings of any kind may include complaints about other members of the congregation, its
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.300]   leaders, or even outsiders at whose hands they were suffering."
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.860]   Berean, I'm always so encouraged to hear about you guys.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.900]   I know some of you here and I hear good things about this church.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.540]   You know, in San Diego I went to Lighthouse Bible Church, so we were loosely affiliated
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:24.900]   and we spent some time with you in like, I forgot, Love Bowl or something like that,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.900]   and different things.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.740]   And I'm always so encouraged.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:36.300]   And yet, Berean, you are not immune to this.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.780]   If you have a heart of grumbling or disputing and you're cultivating that in your personal
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.880]   life, then it's only a matter of time before it infiltrates how this church will be able
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.620]   to run in unity for the gospel cause.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.900]   There's a deep, deep danger if you are grumbling and disputing about another brother or sister
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.660]   within the church, or how a leader is running a program, or how things operate.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.240]   And while it isn't wrong to voice your opinions, you must, you need to, if you begin to see
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.500]   those seeds of grumbling and complaining in your heart, listen to this command of Scripture.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.340]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   Stop complaining.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.980]   It's never okay.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.420]   Complaining runs deep.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.900]   The discontent found in the depths of the heart threatens the very foundation of our
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.560]   faith.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   And we complain.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:36.340]   It's a declaration that we deserve better, that I deserve more, that I'm the most important.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.340]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.900]   Have you ever tried to stop complaining about something?
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.980]   A lot of times you might try to stop complaining about something by comparing your situation
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.540]   with another person's.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.820]   And in that, we become very self-centered.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.660]   I remember in the early days of Addie, in the first few months of her life, she was
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.660]   a very, very difficult child.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.860]   A lot of health conditions, all these things.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.620]   All the night, you know, Kazee would be crying.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.300]   Addie would be shrieking for like, you know, three hours straight, and I'd be holding her.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.420]   And you know, after a few months, it's like, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.820]   I remember trying to soothe my grumbling heart and saying things like, "Well, at least you
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.140]   have a kid.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.620]   There's so many miscarriages out there.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:23.340]   Well, at least she's healthy in that kind of way."
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.660]   When finances are tight and difficult, we say these things to ourselves.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.860]   So by comparing to others, we say, "Well, you know, you live in a top couple percentile
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.860]   of the world.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.900]   You're rich."
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.980]   We soothe ourselves with these things.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.980]   You eat three times a day.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   There are people who eat only once.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.740]   They're starving out there.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.620]   And while that kind of thinking works temporarily, it's not nearly where we need to be.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.620]   This is still selfish thinking that shows how inward complaining is, that even in our
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.300]   fighting of it, we remain.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.460]   We might be tempted to do that even with the Apostle Paul.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.740]   I know sometimes, like Pastor Peter, as I've been interacting with Pastor Peter more, all
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.380]   these stories come out.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.980]   And I hear it, and sometimes I'm like, "Oh, man, I put my head down.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.140]   I didn't suffer like that."
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.800]   And we might be tempted to look at Apostle Paul sitting in prison, and we make ourselves
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.820]   feel better by comparing ourselves to people in these situations, and it's actually a little
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.060]   messed up if you think about it long enough.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.700]   See, in doing this, we console and comfort ourselves, but it doesn't deal with the real
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.980]   grumbling problem of our hearts.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.220]   It becomes a quick fix, and we manipulate our circumstances to stop our mouths from
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.220]   complaining.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.540]   But when another circumstances arise, there it is again.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.140]   There we are again.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.660]   As Christians, what do we know?
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.300]   What are we supposed to compare our situation with?
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.740]   Well, we have been saved from the clutches of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:58.260]   We were enemies of God, destined for the eternal fires of hell.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.660]   Saved from its flames, now adopted into the house of God.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.180]   That song, man, that's an old song.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.900]   I was listening to that.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:13.020]   Once your enemy is seated at your table.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:18.100]   That's why later on in Philippians chapter 3, verse 7 through 11, Paul says what he knows
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.540]   that he has.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:27.420]   And when he sees that he has Jesus and everything else, he says, "I count on his loss."
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.720]   See, complaining is so dangerous because we think we deserve better instead of understanding
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.980]   what we actually have.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.240]   We think we deserve more, and so we complain.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.060]   But church, consider what we actually know.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:46.420]   You and I deserve hell.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.580]   A pastor in college used to say that sometimes.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.180]   He would say, it was always in dating seminars.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.580]   He would call out to all the girls and say, he would call out to men and he would say,
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.940]   "Men, you all are dogs.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.140]   You deserve hell."
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.780]   And all the girls would be, "Yeah, yeah."
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.060]   And she'd be like, "Ladies, what are you guys talking about?
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.500]   You guys don't even deserve dogs."
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:17.820]   You know, it was such a good reminder to me, even in college, that, man, we deserve hell.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:23.820]   This word grumbling is very reminiscent of the words used in Exodus and Deuteronomy,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.540]   talking about the Israelites when they're in the wilderness.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.100]   The ones who had just been saved from Egypt, this terrible, terrible place, with a tyrant
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   of a leader.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:39.660]   And they were brought into this wilderness and given everything that they needed.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.180]   And this word grumbling comes out, grumbling, grumbling, grumbling.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.220]   They would say, "Oh, that we're back in Egypt."
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.100]   When we complain, we cast out the greatest, heaviest, most weighty, precious truth that
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.100]   we have as Christians.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.100]   We throw out the gospel that we have been redeemed.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.580]   And we make it an afterthought.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.060]   We say, "Well, I have salvation, but what this guy is doing is wrong."
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:04.460]   And so instead of lovingly, kindly, humbly approaching each other, knowing who we are,
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.700]   knowing where we came from, we grumble in our hearts when we declare our righteousness,
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.900]   selfishly, rebelliously.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.340]   Complaining is very dangerous.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.100]   It is the most unchristian thing.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.900]   I do want to take a moment and say that there will be undoubtedly situations in your life
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.260]   where circumstances are going to be very difficult.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.340]   And I don't want to downplay situations and circumstances because they're hard.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.700]   There are going to be nights where you're weeping because it's so hard.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.660]   And yet the Bible still says, "Don't grumble and complain."
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   That was the first point.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.740]   That's the longest point.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.340]   The command, "Don't grumble.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.340]   Don't complain."
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.780]   Here's the second, why?
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.780]   Why?
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.020]   Well, point number two is because we are children of God without blemish.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.340]   It's because we're God's children.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.820]   If you look down with me on chapter 2, verse 14 through 15, "Do all things without grumbling
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:07.420]   or disputing," the command, "that," and there's the purpose, "that you may be blameless and
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:13.380]   innocent, children of God without blemish."
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.140]   That you may be shows this purpose.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.020]   It answers the question, "Why are we to follow this command?"
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.940]   It's not a blind following.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.180]   If you search, you'll see that God always gives commands for our good and His glory.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:30.300]   It's always going to be the same thing, His glory, our good, and that's why He gives commands.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.940]   And that is that we are children of God without blemish.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.260]   Here's what He says about children of God, "Blameless and innocent."
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.940]   That word blameless obviously means without blame.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.460]   It means guiltless, faultless.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.780]   When someone looks at you, they can't find fault.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:53.820]   There is no evidence they can dredge up to slander you unless they're lying about you.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.820]   They did that about Jesus, right?
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.660]   There was nothing that they could get Him on, so they lied about Him to get Him on that cross.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.780]   In 1 Thessalonians 2, verse 10, Paul says that his conduct towards them was blameless.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.580]   That is, they looked at Paul's ministry and they couldn't blame him for anything.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   There's no fault.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:15.580]   The second word, innocent, is pertaining to being without a mixture of evil and hence
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.660]   to be pure and untainted.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.940]   It's given to words like unalloyed metals or undiluted wine.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.180]   It's a purity, sincerity, integrity of heart.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.540]   Obviously, these two things, blameless and innocent, aren't talking about the external
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.580]   but the internal.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.540]   Our hearts must not be producing grumbling or disputing, but we are called to be blameless
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.020]   and innocent.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.180]   Why?
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.060]   Why are we called to be blameless and innocent?
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.060]   Just because?
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.380]   Well, no.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.100]   It's because we are children of God.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:58.420]   These are the two sides you could be a part of, grumbling, disputing, blameless or innocent.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.620]   That's it in these situations.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.220]   And the point is not for us to simply to be blameless and innocent, but what that fact
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.460]   points to, children of God are blameless and innocent.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.860]   So in a converse example, what happens when someone sees a child of God grumbling and
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.240]   complaining?
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.100]   It taints the Father's name.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.560]   People question the entire faith on the basis of your testimony.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.640]   When you see divisions in the church, it is the worst testimony to the world.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.940]   People question the entire faith on the basis of it.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.100]   People wonder if you believe in what you believe in.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.340]   The gospel begins to drown out.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.740]   The more difficult the circumstance, the more tempting it is to grumble and complain.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.660]   The more we resist grumbling and complaining, the more we show the blamelessness and innocence
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.340]   that we are as children of God.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.340]   And the more people see that, they're going to see God.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.660]   It's all about God at the end.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:57.420]   His glory, His kingdom, His name, not to be fazed, tainted, broken, manipulated, perverted,
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.420]   warped.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.140]   It's all connected.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.220]   The outside world can get you on this.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.220]   Look at you.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.300]   Say, "Ah, got you.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   You're grumbling.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.740]   You're a complainer.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.100]   You look no different than me.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:20.940]   Actually, you look a little bit worse than me because you say you're a Christian."
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.340]   What do your coworkers see?
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.300]   What do your classmates see?
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:31.740]   What do your roommates, your children, your parents, your family see in you?
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.780]   Do they see blamelessness and innocence?
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.580]   People striving towards this end, working out their salvation to this end?
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:44.220]   Or do they see the markers of the child of God, or do they see a complainer?
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:51.140]   This actually moves us into our third point, the second why, which is it's because we shine
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.500]   as lights.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.140]   We are called to live evangelistically.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   We are called to live as pointers to heaven.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.740]   We are called to show people who God is.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.140]   Look down with me at Philippians 2, verse 14 through 15 again.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.140]   We'll repeat this.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.260]   "We are all things without grumbling or disputing that we may be blameless and innocent, children
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.660]   of God without blemish."
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.660]   And here it is.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:22.700]   "In the midst of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine as lights in the world."
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.180]   We're children of God in the midst of something crooked and twisted.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:31.620]   Crooked has this idea of being warped, mutated, not how it's supposed to be.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.300]   Something is not crooked unless you see straight.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.180]   And the twist it has the idea of perverted or depraved.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.220]   When someone tries to twist something, manipulate something, pervert something, taking something
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.620]   that's innocent and good and changing it into something that's evil.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.820]   And that's our generation.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:53.580]   And it's our generation because this is every generation.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.320]   We are not living in some era where sin is now worse than before.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:04.020]   It has always been terrible and we shouldn't grow surprised when we see evil in our generation.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.680]   What did we expect?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.100]   Something that is blameless and innocent and without blemish then is awesome and refreshing
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.620]   to behold compared to this generation.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.160]   Put that up against something crooked and twisted, it's made that much more powerful,
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.700]   your testimony is.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.560]   Our world fallen in sin is like this.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.920]   And grumbling and disputing is not a small thing.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.180]   It's a deep and dangerous divide in the heart and reveals the condition of it.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.700]   And the sin and darkness engulfs everything, everything on this planet and engulfs it.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.060]   And so when you see something pure, it's powerful.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:50.220]   And we have that ability in our workplaces, homes, classes, places of leisure.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:55.500]   It's only natural for people to grumble, dispute, complain, rebel and be selfish.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.980]   But shocking is when you see the opposite, a child of God, blameless and innocent, not
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.820]   grumbling, not complaining in the hardest of situations and circumstances.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.460]   Do we look the same as the world?
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.980]   I'm not talking about Sunday us.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.200]   I'm talking about the Monday through Saturday us.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:20.420]   I'm talking about the ones that interact with our parents back at home.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.820]   We see it all over Facebook, all over social media.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.460]   It's very common in the workplace where we indulge in grumbling and the quietness and
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.380]   hidden places of our hearts and then we plaster on a face.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.800]   Do we heed this command?
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.660]   Because we are called to be different.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.820]   Everyone and everything is twisted in this world.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.340]   Are we unique?
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.460]   And not just compared to the most depraved of your friends.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.980]   We're not talking about your heathen friend, the one that like, you know, all of us have
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.900]   that one friend that's like, that is kind of crazy out there.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.540]   I'm not talking about comparing to, I'm talking about comparing even to the, maybe to the
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.180]   most moral of your friends.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.100]   Do we look different?
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.980]   The words used here are among whom you shine as lights.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:12.220]   That means the Christian is to look different by shining.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:16.360]   The church is to look different by shining.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.100]   Everything else is darkness.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:28.060]   There's only church light that comes through Christ and darkness, that's it.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.900]   It's not different colored lights.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.860]   Or like there's all these lights that we're competing with.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.140]   As a Christian, we need to be that stark of a difference.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.980]   That contrast needs to be that pronounced where we look like lights and darkness.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.660]   Our fighting against grumbling and disputing, our fighting towards blamelessness and innocence
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:52.980]   as to people's accusations against us, it needs to pop as lights and darkness.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   We need to look different.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   That's what light does.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.940]   When we shine as lights, we're not just being lights, but the light is doing something.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.140]   It's a revealing of something.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.380]   Yes, something about us that we follow God, but ultimately it shines light on who God
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.940]   is.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.780]   And when we are properly shining as lights by not grumbling and complaining, people will
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:15.100]   not leave saying, "Wow, what a wonderful person that guy is."
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.940]   It's going to be, "Wow, what a wonderful God they serve."
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.180]   In Matthew 5, verse 16, it says, "In the same way, let your light shine before others so
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:30.260]   that they may see your good works and bring glory to your Father who is in heaven."
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.780]   It's going to happen if you're shining.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.300]   So in a way, evangelism is not just going out and preaching the gospel.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.860]   In a way, it's all mixed together with your character in life.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.900]   And you must be so unmarked not by grumbling and complaining.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.180]   Isn't that crazy that our grumbling, that our complaining can do a disservice to God's
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:40:00.060]   kingdom where we can actually stop people from bringing glory to God?
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.860]   Because if our light shines so that people see it, so that they'll glorify the Father,
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.140]   if our light is not shining, then what?
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.340]   So that's the third point.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.580]   And to our last point, how do we do this?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.580]   And this is the answer.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.780]   It's not rocket science.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:22.100]   By holding fast to Scripture's life-giving words.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.140]   Complaining has everything to do with truth.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.780]   We complain when we have competing truths in our hearts.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.760]   And since I've been a youth pastor for a while, one of the things I commonly see parents and
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.620]   kids fight about are smartphones.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.220]   Now, in elementary, we helped out with like, we call it Harvest Festival.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.380]   I know you guys call it Reformation Night.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.380]   But I've helped out with like, those programs.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.740]   You know with the elementary kids, actually at our church, they don't really like, ask
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.860]   their parents for smartphones and things like that.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.980]   So they'll, I wonder, you know, like why?
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.420]   Why aren't they like, so crazy about getting these smartphones?
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.140]   Well, it's because their truth is, well nobody else has one.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.140]   We don't really need one.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   And so we're happy.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.140]   That's their truth.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.140]   Well, what happens when they like, all of a sudden their voices start deepening and
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.420]   they get all like, hormonal and stuff?
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.540]   It's that they start looking at each other and like, the truth changes.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.740]   There's a competing truth that happens with the truth.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.620]   The truth is, you don't need the smartphone.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:25.540]   The competing truth becomes, I need the smartphone.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.620]   Everyone's on Snapchat.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.620]   Everyone's on Instagram.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.620]   I need to get a mom.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.300]   And it can't just be any smartphone.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.540]   It has to be one everyone has.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.940]   You can't just go to a kiosk that your mom and dad goes to and like, that random like,
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.100]   one that's like a flip phone or something.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.100]   It can't be that.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   It has to be a galaxy.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.100]   It has to be an iPhone.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   It has to be a Pixel.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:48.900]   It's a competing truth.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.780]   Obviously the problem here is not whether it's right or wrong to have a nice phone,
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.020]   but the state of the heart is being displayed in grumbling and complaining against the parents.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.140]   It's following a perceived truth.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.500]   And that is why in order to do all things without grumbling or disputing, the scriptures
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.980]   are everything.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.300]   The word of God is everything to you.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:13.620]   It's the truth by which everything gets standardized.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.060]   It's the truth by which we fight perceived wrong truth.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.740]   That's why Jesus says in John 17, 17, "Sanctify them in the truth because your word is truth."
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.020]   Our sanctification happens inside of truth.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.980]   We go back to the same truth of the gospel we talked about just a moment before.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.900]   Remember who you were and who you are now.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.580]   Remember what you deserve and look at what you have now.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.300]   It goes far beyond the superficial things of this world.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.220]   In 1 John 2, verse 15, it says that the world is passing away along with all its desires.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.780]   These things are just going, going, going.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.580]   But we have something eternal, imperishable.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.860]   It's something that cannot be taken away or destroyed.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:00.340]   We have a truth of the gospel, a hope of the gospel, a hope of inheritance that we have
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.020]   through Jesus.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:11.180]   How can we ever complain about anything ever again?
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.260]   How can we ever dispute?
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:19.740]   The reason why complaining leads to disunity in the church is because when we are clinging
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:24.620]   to these things that are so peripheral, it competes against this greater truth of what
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.140]   we're doing as a church.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.260]   And that's why churches go through splits over how money is used.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.980]   Of course the discussion is that we're trying to use finances for God's kingdom and glory,
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:40.260]   but when some littler truth supersedes that of the gospel, you begin to see division.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.460]   First in our hearts and actually physically, congregation split.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.540]   We hear about this all the time.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.620]   People are leaving.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.860]   But when we're in the word of God, that needs to always be the central starting point that
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.500]   dictates everything.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.540]   We are called to unity.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.380]   So that humility and understanding and kindness and compassion and gentle rebuke and sharpening
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.620]   happens and precedes all these other things that are important.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:12.580]   About how we use money, about what kind of programs we do, about which way our church
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.580]   is going, all of this stuff.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.260]   I'm talking about this because we've been talking about this a lot at our church.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.700]   The word is the thing that in Hebrews chapter 4 it says divides the thoughts and intentions
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.740]   of our hearts.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.380]   You can feel so right in what you're saying, so justified in what you're saying, but the
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:33.660]   word is going to open us up and just display the ugliness of our hearts.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.980]   In James 1 it says that scripture is like a mirror that just reveals the truth.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.940]   The mirror is not going to lie to you and say, "You look beautiful."
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:50.340]   You look at it and you go, "Whoa, I better fix myself up before I go to church."
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.340]   It's called the word of life that we are called to hold fast to.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.420]   It gives life.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.580]   The word is so, so important.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.260]   Something that we can't simply study.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:06.020]   It constantly needs to be the instrument by which our hearts are refined and purged.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:09.620]   Have you been grumbling, disputing, and complaining lately?
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:14.260]   Have you been a bad witness lately to family, to friends, coworkers, teachers, classmates,
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.780]   the same people we keep bringing up?
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.860]   Even a stranger on the road?
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:25.940]   That means that even though you might be reading your Bible every day, it might be like a mile
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.620]   behind you, you're just on a leash and you're just pulling it behind you.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:36.780]   The Bible says here we need to hold fast to it, cling, it needs to be close to us.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.460]   We're fixing our eyes on it.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.420]   We're hiding it in our hearts.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.140]   You will not be distracted by what the world says, by what the enemy says, or even what
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.220]   your heart says.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.820]   It doesn't matter if you're tired or angry.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.500]   It doesn't matter if you're a boss or your teacher is unfair.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.700]   It doesn't matter if your children are going crazy.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.700]   You hold fast to it in desperation.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.460]   If the word gives life, then without the word there is death.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:05.440]   We need to meditate on the gospel over and over and over again every single day.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.460]   Remember everything that you have in Christ.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.380]   For me, I like to go through Ephesians chapter one and two whenever I forget what I have
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.380]   in Christ.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.580]   Just study and just look at the richness of what we have.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.700]   If we indeed have everything that the gospel promises, if we have been given Jesus Christ
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.780]   himself, I don't think we're going to be complaining about some of the things that
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.100]   we're so tempted to complain about.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.380]   Church, there is no quick fix to our hearts.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.820]   There's no quick fix to our complaining hearts.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:39.180]   We need to cling fast to the word of God that is constantly going to remind us, change us,
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:46.420]   cultivate in us a heart of gratitude, which is the opposite of complaint.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.660]   Scripture is the timeless standard of truth that stands above everything else.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.700]   Don't force yourself into not complaining.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:59.220]   It needs to be changed by the work of the spirit through the word of God.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.100]   So as a reminder to us, this is a command that we all will fail in.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.020]   The idea is not to legalistically force ourselves to stop complaining, to leave this room and
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.620]   say, "I gotta stop complaining, stop complaining," but simply to remember the truth we have in
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.460]   our gospel identity, that the word of God will draw us to a reminder of these truths
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.100]   and give us a grumble-free life.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.620]   My favorite passage is in Philippians chapter two, verse five through 11, and it shows us
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:29.580]   this example of Christ, who was God, came to earth, and died the worst.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.340]   Christ is ultimately the greatest example of someone who didn't complain, a Christ who
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.900]   would willingly give himself for others and endure hardship and persecutions, even to
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:43.220]   the point of death, even death on a cross, and he would do it silently.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:48.480]   No complaint from his mouth, never screaming of injustice, never thrashing about the unfairness
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   of it all.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.900]   The only one who could actually say, "This is not fair," was the only one who remained
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.180]   silent.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.120]   God gave his son for us, and through him our sins are paid.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.340]   We have a living hope.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.820]   We have a promised inheritance.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.940]   We have a home awaiting us.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.420]   This world is passing away, but the kingdom is at hand.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.920]   I love 1 Corinthians 4.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:17.380]   It says that this light momentary affliction is preparing for us this weight of glory that
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.580]   is beyond all comparison.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.740]   What is to come is so much greater than what we have, and so when we fix our eyes on that,
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.700]   what we have doesn't matter so much.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.980]   When you cling to the word of life, grumbling cease and complaining turns into praise.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:36.260]   It's a call to us to remember that the word of life, clinging close, holding fast, is
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.080]   the only way to accomplish this command.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:44.380]   The only way Paul, so beaten up, so derided in life, can say that I count all things as
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.940]   lost compared to the surpassing worth, I'm knowing Jesus Christ my Lord.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.960]   It is the only way, church, by which we will be marked by this kind of heart, where the
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.580]   world will see that we are people who don't grumble, who don't complain, not because life
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   is hard.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:04.940]   Actually, life gets harder, but because we treasure something so much.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.740]   And so there as a testimony, whenever you see a testimony on an infomercial, you see
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.100]   that person who loves their product so much, you go like, "Oh, I'm kind of interested in
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.100]   this product now."
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.940]   In a similar way, they're going to see your life, and you will shine, and people will
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.180]   come to Christ, and God will be glorified in you and in me.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.780]   Let's pray.
