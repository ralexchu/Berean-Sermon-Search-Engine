[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:45.420]   - Okay, good morning, church family, happy Lord's Day.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.960]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   As always, it is a joy and a privilege for us
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.500]   to gather together freely to worship our God
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.380]   and to remember what he has done for us in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.380]   This morning, I'd like to begin by reading
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.840]   from Philippians 2, verses five to 11.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.040]   Have this attitude in yourselves,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.300]   which is also in Christ Jesus,
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.260]   who, although he existed in the form of God,
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.500]   did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.260]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.920]   and being made in the likeness of men.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.000]   Being found in appearance as a man,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.540]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.180]   to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.380]   For this reason also, God highly exalted him
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.800]   and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.080]   so that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.580]   of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.880]   and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   to the glory of God the Father.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.620]   Amen.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.080]   Let us worship him.

[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.580]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.500]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.180]   I'm holding up here a Korean flag.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.560]   So as you have seen as you're walking in,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.340]   there is a lunch fundraiser that is prepared.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.240]   And this is for the fundraiser going on
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.620]   for our Korea Summer Mission team.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.680]   And the gourmet hot dogs,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.880]   and it emphasizes gourmet, okay, not Costco.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.760]   There are four or five different kinds of chili.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.560]   There's sauerkraut, there's special onion
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.220]   chopped in little pieces for you.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.780]   That's all being sold for $10 for adults and $5 for kids.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.880]   And this is after this service
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.900]   and also for the third service.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.740]   So that you have a members meeting
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.420]   that's happening at two o'clock
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.660]   and so that you don't have to go out,
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.920]   you can grab the lunch and then stick around.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.500]   Right at two o'clock, we're gonna start.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.260]   But let me explain a little bit about what's going on.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.380]   Because for so many years,
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.700]   we've been coming in and out of China
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.540]   and short-term missions at our church
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.320]   was a crucial part of the life of the church.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.920]   But because of what was happening in China,
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.320]   obviously, we couldn't do that.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.240]   There was an attempt at trying to,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.960]   we did some short-term mission to India
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.540]   and we know we have missions that we have doing in Japan
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.960]   that we've done before.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.400]   But now that the Korea is open
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.520]   and possibly Taiwan is also opening up in October,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.640]   we didn't want to bombard,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.200]   every time people went out to missions,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.960]   bombard the church with support me letters.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.100]   And so after four or five rounds of that,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.940]   it's gonna be,
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.660]   you're gonna be getting like from all these people.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.900]   So in order to prevent that,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.420]   what we've decided to do is try to raise funds
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.940]   for the short-term missions collectively.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.720]   And so that's why we have all these fundraisers
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.700]   that's gonna be going to that.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.420]   We're hoping to raise about $40,000
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.900]   that's gonna support our summer mission team.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.900]   And so that's why we have these fundraisers
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.460]   and this also with the auction that's happening
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.720]   and we're hoping that if we can raise enough funds
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.840]   to do that to support our summer missions
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.040]   that we don't have to individually
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.480]   go send out letters to the church.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.800]   So they're raising funds if they can outside the church,
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.880]   but inside the church, we're trying to do it collectively
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.800]   and see hopefully this works.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.880]   Otherwise we're gonna end up like sending letters
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.620]   and you're gonna be getting like 15 letters
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.120]   every two months, okay?
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.800]   And so that's what we're doing.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.200]   So hopefully if we raise enough funds, that'll be it.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.540]   If not, we may ask for maybe an offering taken
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.780]   that'll kind of cover the rest of what we need,
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.820]   but that's going forward, not only for Japan,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.340]   sorry, Korea and Taiwan and other mission opportunities
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.160]   that are gonna open up.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.380]   We're hoping to do it that route
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.340]   in order to consolidate the support, okay?
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.420]   The brain auction fundraiser,
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.940]   the bidding for it is starting today.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.260]   And so just kind of give a heads up,
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.740]   you can go and ask or if you have any questions about that.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.060]   During members meeting, there's gonna be
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.940]   a more of a thorough explanation of what's going on.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.860]   And then FIG ministry,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.800]   this is the family ministry in our church.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   If you're not part of FAM245,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.820]   the family ministry and the jubilee ministry
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.740]   is doing round two of the Bible reading fellowship together.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.340]   So if you've been part of it
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.900]   and you wanna sign up for the second round,
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.560]   you can sign up for that.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.300]   If you haven't done it and you wanna participate,
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.580]   you can sign up for that as well.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.220]   Yeah, in the first service, I said it was the Old Testament,
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.340]   but it actually is further New Testament Acts
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.740]   through Philippians.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.460]   So please sign up for that, okay?
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.220]   And also for the special seminar that's going on
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.920]   in May 4th, abortion, birth control, and IVF.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.900]   If you haven't signed up for that, we wanna encourage,
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.100]   we wanna try to get as many of the church members
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.800]   into that as possible, okay?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.580]   Outside of that, let me pray for us.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.220]   And then our brother Caleb Sang is gonna come up,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.180]   give his testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.340]   All right, let me pray.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.340]   Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.500]   We thank you, Father God, for your patience
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.620]   beyond our comprehension, how you persevere with us,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.940]   how you initiated your love toward us.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   I pray, Father God, that our worship that we give you
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.460]   would not simply be putting in our time or singing songs,
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.420]   but that it would be an overflow of gratitude in our hearts
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.220]   of recognition of what you've given us
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.500]   and what we continue to have in you.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.140]   I pray that you would bless this worship,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.940]   bless even this giving, that it would be given to you
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.340]   in thanksgiving as an overflow of gratitude to you.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.460]   May your name and your name alone be magnified.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.140]   In Jesus' name, we pray, amen.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.020]   (gentle music)
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:27.220]   - All right, would you please rise
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.540]   and take a moment to say hello to those around you,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.360]   and we will continue our worship.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.940]   (gentle music)
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:53.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.940]   (upbeat music continues)

[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.420]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:30.640]   - Good morning, church.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.240]   My name is Caleb Tsang, and this is my testimony.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.380]   I was born in a Christian household,
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.180]   some might even say a very Christian household.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.380]   I went to church, youth group, Awana, retreats,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.320]   and I even grew up in a Christian private school
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.020]   from kindergarten to eighth grade.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.320]   My grandparents were also missionaries in China,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.200]   living in persecution under a communist government.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.360]   My grandfather was imprisoned for over 20 years
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.700]   for being a non-compliant youth pastor.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.580]   But even being after told, sorry,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.940]   but even after being told incredible stories
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.880]   of faithfulness, memorizing countless Bible verses,
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.680]   and hearing the gospel many times,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   I did not see the slightest application to my own life.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.480]   It all seemed like a story for the adults to talk about.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.260]   That is, until seventh grade, I was afraid of dying.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.460]   I would lay in bed and count the seconds,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.560]   thinking of the possibility
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.520]   that I would never wake up again.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.660]   One night, I became restless
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.860]   and woke up my mom around 12 a.m.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.240]   I frantically explained to her my fear of death
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.200]   and asked her how I might be able to save myself.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   She lovingly shared with me the verse 1 John 4:18,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.360]   which says that God's perfect love casts out fear.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.800]   I found comfort in this verse,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.000]   but only because I wanted God
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.160]   to cast out my fears for me.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.440]   I did not care about loving God back or serving him.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.320]   I was a prideful young kid who thought he was smart.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.800]   In Bible class, I imagined the hardest questions
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.440]   in hopes of stumping my Bible teacher
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.160]   in front of my classmates.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.400]   My arrogance overflowed whenever I would judge
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.280]   my hypocritical, so-called Christian friends.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.360]   When I transitioned into a public high school,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   I basked in the title of being the good kid
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   who had good morals.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.640]   It was sweet to hear people call me good.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.840]   And on the side, I would secretly find ways
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.220]   to indulge in my flesh and worldly pleasures.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.840]   As I became busy with schoolwork and extracurriculars,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.700]   I began hating going to church.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.960]   My church, or sorry, my heart was continually hardened,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.980]   and God did not seem to exist in me anymore.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.480]   There'd be times where I would be in the shower
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.920]   after a long day, whispering out loud,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.560]   "God, if you are truly real,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.980]   "why don't you just show yourself to me?"
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.920]   And in his fatherly patience,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.640]   God revealed himself in his word.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.120]   During the college ministry's Galatians Bible study,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.480]   we discussed justification by faith.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.880]   But James 2.26 says, "For as the body,
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.560]   "apart from the spirit, is dead,
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.680]   "so also faith, apart from works, is dead."
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.120]   After studying this verse, I was severely offended.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.040]   For many years, I thought I knew what it meant to have faith.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.240]   After all, I believed there was a creator
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.960]   who made the universe and sent his son
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.040]   to take away the sins of the world.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.300]   But even the demons believed this,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.600]   and I could not think of a single time in my life
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.440]   that I had wanted to live for God out of a love for him.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.800]   I'd hated God, and I realized my faithless life
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.920]   was truly fruitless.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.740]   It was during one sermon from Pastor Peter Kim
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.280]   that I felt ruined.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.920]   He played a video of an 18-year-old boy in the courtroom
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.760]   who was speaking to a woman.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.860]   She had murdered his older brother
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.160]   by violently gunning him down in his own home.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.240]   But the younger brother spoke lovingly to her.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.800]   I clenched my fists, and I gripped my teeth
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.640]   as I watched this boy forgive the death
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.520]   of his older brother.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.220]   How could he forgive her?
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.580]   How could he be so loving?
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.520]   If...
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.720]   If someone had killed...
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   If someone had killed my older brother,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:06.360]   I knew what my first thoughts would be.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:16.060]   Hatred, anger, revenge.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:21.200]   And for the first time in years,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.360]   I cried with my hands in my face.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.160]   I came to the realization that Jesus
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   forgives these sins like no other.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.280]   I have sinned against him too many times
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.240]   for him to count, but he has forgiven every one of my sins.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.720]   In Romans 7, Paul writes, "Wretched man that I am,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.400]   "who will deliver me from this body of death."
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.940]   Thanks be to God, through Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.020]   (sniffling)
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.700]   I deserve to be punished, and if anything,
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.660]   I could have died sooner and been thrown
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.500]   straight into hell, and this would have been just.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.200]   But God is patient and merciful,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.340]   and he has opened my blind eyes.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.660]   Jesus saw my lust, my arrogance, my bitterness,
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   and he took it upon himself, upon his own life.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.180]   And the good news of Jesus dying in my wretched place
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.300]   shows the greatest love of all.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.120]   Romans 6.23 says that for the wages of sin is death,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.960]   but the free gift of God is eternal life
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.220]   in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.620]   And throughout my first quarter at UC Irvine,
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.500]   God softened my heart.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.100]   No longer is he just the God at church,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.140]   or the God of my parents, or the God of my grandparents.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   He's my God that I love and that I will put my faith in.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.320]   In his voice, I will trust and obey.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.780]   Psalm 73.25-26.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.020]   Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.180]   There is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.480]   My flesh and my heart will fail,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.940]   but God is the strength of my heart
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.820]   and my portion forever.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.780]   I know that I will still fail.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.980]   I know that I will still sin.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.680]   But what I do know is that a perfect man named Jesus
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.900]   has watched me clean on a cross.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.220]   And I know that after I fall asleep for the last time,
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.100]   I will see him in paradise
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.260]   and I will walk righteously with my Savior.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.060]   After being released from 23 years of prison,
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.780]   my grandpa and his family immigrated to the United States.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.700]   He passed away a little more than 10 years ago,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.780]   but I remember my dad writing his last words
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.100]   on a piece of paper, showing them to me and my siblings.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.700]   It reads, "To love the Lord, to serve the Lord,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.580]   "and to please the Lord."
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.500]   Yeah, yeah, now I understand.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:56.340]   Jesus is my Savior and the master of my life, thank you.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.260]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.420]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:22.060]   - You understand when you go into the water
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.020]   and you're the United Christ's life, Christ's death,
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.020]   then you're coming out the United Christ's resurrected life.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.940]   I baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:39.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:53.060]   - All right, thank you, Caleb, for that powerful testimony.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.940]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter eight,
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.800]   I'm gonna be reading from verse four to verse 11.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.660]   We're gonna begin at part one
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.960]   of possibly three messages in this text.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.900]   Luke chapter eight, verses four through 11.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.440]   Now a large crowd was coming together,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.260]   and those from the various cities were journeying to him.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.980]   He spoke by way of parable.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.260]   The sower went out to sow his seed.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.420]   And as he sowed, some fell beside the road,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.820]   and it was trampled underfoot,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.980]   and the birds of the air ate it up.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.660]   Other seeds fell on the rocky soil,
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.100]   and as soon as it grew up,
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.080]   it withered away because it had no moisture.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.800]   Other seeds fell among the thorns,
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.540]   and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.580]   Other seeds fell on the good soil and grew up
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.440]   and produced a crop a hundred times as great.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.820]   As he said these things, he would call out,
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.020]   he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.640]   His disciples began questioning him
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.080]   as to what this parable meant.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.060]   And he said, to you it has been granted
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.380]   to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.020]   but to the rest it is a parable,
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.700]   so that seeing that they may not see,
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.420]   and hearing that they may not understand.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.940]   Now the parable is this, the seed is the word of God.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.780]   Let's pray.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:15.100]   Father, we pray for deeper and truer understanding
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.420]   of who you are, and the very thing that you have ordained
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.740]   for the hearers, Lord God, of the first century,
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.600]   that you would help us to understand as well.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.560]   So we lift this time to you, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.680]   If you can put up the picture, okay?
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.240]   Yeah, so I've shown you this before,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.160]   but this is basically the picture of the wheat and the tares.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.000]   And so on the surface, it's very difficult to tell,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.200]   and Jesus gives a parable of the wheat and the tares,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.120]   and how we have to be careful in distinguishing them two.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.960]   And so because it's hard to distinguish
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.320]   that if you do it too early,
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.960]   you're gonna end up pulling up the wheat
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.200]   instead of the tares.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.480]   And so I've shared this before,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.000]   that you can't really tell the difference between the two
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.120]   until it begins to bear fruit.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.560]   So the wheat, when the wheat begins to come in,
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.820]   because of the weight of the wheat,
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.320]   it begins to basically bend down,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.700]   and then tares, because the wheat doesn't come in,
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.760]   it continues to grow.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.680]   So you can't distinguish between the two
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.780]   until you see the fruit.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.400]   And by fruit, it says you will know what they really are.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.880]   Now, the reason why I show you this again
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.160]   is because the text that we're looking at
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.920]   tells us that a crowd is beginning to grow
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.680]   in larger and larger amounts.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.960]   So almost every event that Luke records up to this point
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.480]   begins by telling us that the crowd is growing.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.520]   So by this time, a larger and larger crowd,
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.600]   probably in the hundreds,
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.880]   maybe in the thousands, are coming to Christ,
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.020]   and it is in that context
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.380]   that Jesus turns and gives this parable.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.940]   So the purpose of this parable is very clear.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.520]   He is telling the crowd that is coming
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.100]   that just because they are gathering because of him
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.540]   doesn't make them true believers,
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.980]   that a lot of people are coming to him
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.220]   for all kinds of reasons.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.820]   Some of them are gonna be rocky soil,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.380]   some of them are soil that falls to the side,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.640]   and it's not gonna bear anything,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.960]   some of them are just gonna be on the thorn,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.240]   and some of them, some of them will persevere
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.080]   through all of it, and they will bear fruit.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.240]   So he's telling the crowd
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.200]   that just because you're gathering here,
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.400]   like that this is not God's purpose, right?
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.220]   This is what God's main desire,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.000]   Jesus' main goal in ministry,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.780]   is not to gather the largest crowd possible.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.820]   And that's a mistake that we make in the church,
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.160]   that we think that if the church is small,
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.080]   and it begins to grow, something must be happening.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.320]   And so most books that are written about church growth,
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.520]   or maybe that's a church that we need to model after,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.920]   are churches that have grown.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   So whether it's 1,000, or 10,000, or maybe it's 50,000,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.640]   so there must be something that they're doing
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.600]   that we must learn, and so what ends up happening
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.960]   is we think that the purpose of the church
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.640]   is to gather the largest crowd possible,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.880]   and if we gather the largest crowd,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.040]   we have greater audience, and books are written about us,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.840]   and other people will model.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.240]   Well, Jesus looks at the crowd,
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.400]   and there is a concern that this isn't real fruit.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.440]   In fact, we'll see that.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.200]   And in time, many of them are gonna be weeded out, in time.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.840]   Right now, they're not seeing it,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.320]   but he's basically prepping them.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.940]   He's also telling the disciples,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.440]   because you can imagine how excited the disciples are.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.360]   You know, they connected with the right master,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.560]   and more and more, it seems like he's the Messiah,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.360]   and these are small fishermen from a small town,
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.920]   and all of a sudden, their master's a celebrity,
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.000]   and thousands of people are coming to him,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.880]   and so obviously, the disciples are also getting known,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.200]   and he's preparing the disciples that in due time,
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.760]   in due time, this crowd is going to be weeded out.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.280]   Many of them are gonna fall,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.840]   even though right now, you don't see it,
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.200]   but many of them are gonna drift out,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.400]   and time will test to see the quality of their faith.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.640]   So not only is he warning the crowd,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.160]   he's also preparing his disciples
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.380]   for what inevitably is going to happen.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.440]   The way we do evangelism, if we're not careful,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.040]   that we try to gather as many people as possible,
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   and thinking that if they're at church,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.920]   they weren't church, and then now, they're church,
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.120]   and if we go from non-church to church,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.640]   that somehow, we've done our job.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.000]   We see clearly that that was not Jesus' focus.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.720]   Jesus' focus is to make sure that true fruit,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.200]   true faith, is what they come to Jesus with.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.240]   The common mistake that we can make
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   is that because God has given us the Great Commission,
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.680]   and this is something that we wanna take seriously
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.160]   in church, but you cannot be a light
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.320]   with a church filled with people who are unconverted.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.400]   Coming to church doesn't mean you've converted.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.540]   Being involved in being a member of a church
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.280]   doesn't mean that you've genuinely converted.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.960]   You growing up in a Christian home
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.080]   doesn't make you converted.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.720]   He says, there are many people who will come.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.640]   Some will drop away early, some will look like fruit,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.620]   and then they will drop away.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.680]   Some will even become leaders, and serve,
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.640]   and do great things, but eventually,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   life, and circumstance, and various things
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.880]   will choke their wheat out, but the problem is,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.120]   in the church, that the third soil people
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.780]   never physically leave.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.700]   Now, if we were in a church where we were persecuted,
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.380]   and your livelihood, and your physical health
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.980]   was threatened, it may weed out more people,
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.140]   but because we're not, we live in a post-Christian culture,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.220]   and there's all kinds of benefit,
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.220]   even if you're not a Christian,
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.580]   even if you're not a follower of Christ,
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.260]   and so, the purpose of this parable
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.220]   is to warn, and to prepare his disciples
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.460]   for what is going to come, and eventually,
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.720]   as Jesus begins to head toward the cross,
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.820]   less and less people are gonna follow him.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.660]   They're gonna reject him.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.840]   That's what it says in John 6, 66.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.420]   Well, this morning, our attention is not going
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.060]   to be focused on the four seals,
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.740]   four seeds, or the soils.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.300]   I wanna focus our attention on the agent
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.660]   in what God uses to distinguish the four soils,
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.020]   and which is the seed, and it clearly tells us
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.220]   that the seed is the word of God, like in verse 11,
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.700]   and I know some people may say, it's like,
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.620]   oh, you know, Berean's about the word,
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.060]   and the church down the street, we're about evangelism,
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.020]   church down the street over there, we're about counseling,
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.820]   we're about this, we're about that,
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.740]   as if God kinda set a set for us, a smorgasbord,
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.820]   and then whatever you're hungry for, you can choose.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.460]   No, the word of God is the agent
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.780]   that God uses to distinguish and to bring salvation,
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.620]   so what I wanna look at this morning
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.880]   is, before we jump into the details of the parable,
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.540]   the agent of the seed that God has given
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.580]   to bear fruit, number one,
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.700]   the primary agent through which fruit,
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.540]   when I say fruit, we're talking about salvation,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.380]   is initiated, is the word of God, it's the seed.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.820]   Now, I noticed something really interesting
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.360]   in the creation of man in Genesis 2:7,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.980]   after he created everything, he creates man,
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.700]   but he's not quite human yet until this happens,
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.460]   in verse seven, "Then the Lord God formed man of dust
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.760]   "from the ground and breathed into his nostrils
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.900]   "the breath of life, and man became a living being."
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.020]   He wasn't quite human being yet.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.420]   He was like creation, like everything else,
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.500]   but what distinguishes us from the rest of creation
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.700]   is that God put his very breath in us,
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.300]   but as you know, God said that if you disobey me,
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.480]   right, that you will surely die.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.140]   How do we distinguish when somebody's living or not?
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.360]   Now, I know we have technology and we hook them up
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.140]   to see, you know, the heartbeat and all the stuff,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.140]   but generally, you can tell if they're breathing or not,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.540]   right, even if things are working,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.360]   if they're not breathing, we know right away,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.780]   there is no breath, and so life has departed them.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.220]   The Bible says what gave us life is his own breath,
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.900]   but what's interesting in 2 Timothy 3:16,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.660]   he says, "All scripture is inspired by God
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.400]   "and proffered for teaching, for reproof,
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.780]   "for correction, for training in righteousness."
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.620]   What's interesting is that word for inspired by God,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.060]   the literal translation of that is God breathed,
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.660]   and if you have the ESV or the NIV,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.980]   that's exactly how it's translated.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.660]   The ESV says it was breathed out by God,
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.580]   or the NIV just straight up says it is God breathed,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.300]   so I don't know if you're already making the connection.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.700]   What distinguishes us from the rest of creation
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.600]   is the breath of God.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.420]   Now, because of sin, sin reigns and death reigns on mankind,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.540]   and in order to bring regeneration to this man,
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.180]   God needs to breathe his breath back into man,
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.000]   and he has said he has ordained the word of God.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.860]   He has put his breath into the word of God
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.500]   so that through the word of God
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.820]   that the breath would be revived in us.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.960]   Are you seeing the connection?
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.660]   So the primary agent in which life is given back
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.660]   to a fallen man is through the word of God, the seed,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.100]   and Romans 10, 17, it says so faith comes from hearing,
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.700]   and the hearing, what, by the word of Christ.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.140]   So when you hear the word of God,
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.820]   something is reignited, and the breath of God
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.540]   comes into you, and that springs up into eternal life.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.760]   John 17, 17, it says sanctify them by the truth.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.620]   Your word is truth.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.760]   And I can spend the rest of my time this morning
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.540]   just going over passage after passage after passage
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.700]   of the emphasis that God has given
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.300]   on the agency of the seed, of the word,
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.980]   to bring eternal life.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.620]   If we're not careful, we think that the word of God
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.400]   is kind of boring, it's theological,
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.160]   and there's some part of the population
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.860]   that kind of likes that kind of stuff,
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.340]   and then many churches have drifted away
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.180]   from the word of God because they say it's not effective.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.420]   It's not effective because it's boring.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.380]   We live in a TikTok generation
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.700]   where their attention span is like, what, 15 seconds?
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.120]   And then to sit here every Sunday
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.420]   to exposit the word of God and to tell you the meaning
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.260]   and the history behind it, it's just not effective.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.340]   So many people have drifted away
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.060]   from the teaching of God's word,
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.340]   thinking that if we have programs,
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.980]   maybe if we have, meet their felt needs,
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.940]   and maybe if we have clubs and various things,
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.660]   and maybe sinners will be more interested,
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.060]   that somehow that is going to reignite them.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.300]   Utter garbage.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.820]   That's not what the scripture tells us.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.420]   The scripture tells us that the word of God,
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:06.340]   not the most important, not one of many,
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.780]   only the word of God has been given as an agency
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.060]   to bring the breath of God back into a sinner.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.060]   Not only is the word of God used to bring life,
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.440]   it also is given to hardened sinners.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.420]   That's what it says in verse nine,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:23.460]   and in the other text, it's like,
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.380]   why are you speaking in parables?
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.900]   Jesus answers in verse eight, verse four,
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.180]   and he said, "To you it has been granted
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.940]   "to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.480]   "but to the rest it is in parables,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.000]   "so that seeing they may not see,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.400]   "and hearing they may not understand."
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.380]   He says the word of God not only softens the heart of men
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.720]   and the breath of God is put back,
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.700]   but when sinners do not repent
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.060]   and they hear the word of God, it hardens them.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:53.080]   Now, if your ears have been opened
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.880]   and you've seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.080]   do parables help you?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.340]   Yes, of course it helps you.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.660]   That's why whenever we give sermons,
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.780]   we try to give illustrations or stories
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.260]   or something to help you to connect.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.720]   Connected thoughts, it's like, oh, okay,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.500]   I see how that is applied.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.820]   That's why we tell stories.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.320]   And so Jesus tells these stories
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.980]   because once your eyes get open,
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.300]   it makes so much more sense.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.040]   But to an unconverted, uncommitted, unrepentant person,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.800]   the word of God is hidden to them.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.360]   And every time they hear the word of God,
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.420]   it hardens them even further.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.600]   That's why even in the church,
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.840]   people who've been in a Bible-teaching church
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.520]   all their life, unrepentant, are hardest people to reach.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.720]   They are the hardest people to reach.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.240]   Not the drug addicts, not the prostitutes,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.740]   but people who have been hardened by the word of God
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.540]   week after week after week.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.220]   They hear the word of God, but they are unrepentant.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.980]   They pick and choose what they want from Christ,
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.420]   and the things that they don't want from Christ,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.020]   they just kinda sweep it under the rug.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.420]   And so they live with uncommitted,
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   unrepentant sins in their life,
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.820]   and they highlight the things that they are doing.
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.500]   I'm committed to church, I'm reading books,
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.220]   I'm doing this, I'm faithful in Bible study,
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.260]   and yet they know they have not fully surrendered to God.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.620]   There's unrepentant things that they want
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.980]   that they know that God does not want,
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.260]   and as a result of that,
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.940]   every time the word of God is preached,
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.180]   their hearts become harder and harder and harder.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.120]   You know what's interesting in Isaiah chapter six,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.660]   when God calls Isaiah to go representing,
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.500]   who will go for me?
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.020]   And he says, "Here am I, send me."
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:43.060]   And then here's his assignment to Isaiah.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.860]   After all that drama of seeing the glory of his throne,
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   he said, "Here's the assignment."
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.500]   He said, "Go and tell this people,
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.100]   "keep on listening, but do not proceed.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.660]   "Keep on looking, but do not understand.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.660]   "Render the hearts of this people insensitive."
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.900]   Like, "Here am I, send me."
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.140]   And then he says, "Render their hearts insensitive."
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   Like, why, first of all, why would you send me
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.820]   to tell these people who aren't gonna listen, right?
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.140]   He said, "Part of the work is to warn sinners,
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.140]   "that when the judgment comes,
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.340]   "maybe later down the line,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.940]   "they realize that God was pleading with them to repent,
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.340]   "that God left his witness."
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.660]   But he says, "Render their hearts insensitive."
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.980]   Like, how was he gonna do that?
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.980]   What did God tell Isaiah to do
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.460]   to render their hearts insensitive?
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.420]   Was he speaking softly, right?
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.860]   Was he on his knees pleading with God,
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.140]   "Lord, harden their heart"?
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.060]   Is that what he was doing?
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.020]   No, he just told them to go preach
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.380]   what I tell you to preach.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.460]   Judgment is coming because of your unrepentant sin.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.700]   And he's pleading with them to repent.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.380]   And because they wouldn't repent,
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.700]   their hearts automatically become hardened.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.500]   Render their hearts insensitive,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.740]   because if you keep hearing the word of God,
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.860]   and you pick and choose,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.400]   I will do what I want to do,
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.060]   and you remain the God of your life.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.140]   He's not king, he's just somebody
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.620]   that you admire from a distance,
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.900]   but he's not your king.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.700]   And as a result of that,
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.660]   your hearts become more and more hardened
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.420]   every single year.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.180]   You are more difficult to reach with the word of God
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.580]   than you were five years ago and 10 years ago.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.220]   You are much more hardened.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:35.100]   You do not hear the voice of God.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.860]   You hear information that's coming from the word of God,
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.740]   but you do not hear the voice of God.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.320]   Your heart has become hardened,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.560]   and you have willfully hardened your heart,
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.360]   because you refuse to surrender your life to Christ.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.880]   The word of God not only softens,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.760]   but it hardens the heart of sinners who are unrepentant.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.260]   The same sun that melts the ice hardens the clay.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.520]   And so we need to be clear
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.040]   that what attracts sinners to Christ is his word.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   And what causes sinners to reject Christ is also his word.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.580]   And we need to make sure that our church
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.660]   isn't attracting people with anything less
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.460]   than the word of God.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.780]   And if you choose to hate the church,
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.020]   not because of the program,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.220]   not because we lack this,
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.720]   and not because we're not giving ourselves
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.660]   to a certain purpose, but it's the word.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:38.020]   Because that's the agency in which God has given us.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.160]   I remember years ago, when I was in seminary,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.960]   when the Seeker Friendly Movement was coming in,
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.480]   and we were being taught how to market the church,
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.720]   and how to brand our name,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.920]   and they were saying there's different levels
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.000]   of people who have faith,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.320]   and they identify seven levels of people
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.140]   who are not Christian,
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.680]   seven levels of people who are Christians,
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.720]   and they were telling us how to market the word of God,
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.660]   or the gospel in different stages.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.360]   And I remember, again, as a young student,
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.000]   just being wide open, I had no idea what this was,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.960]   but this is what we're being taught.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.360]   And I remember an older lady in the classroom
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.740]   standing up and saying,
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.400]   that sounds like manipulation.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.640]   And it was weird, because many of us
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.560]   were thinking the same thing,
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.840]   but until she articulated,
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.580]   we were just like, something seems a little bit off.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.640]   That we're trying to get the gospel out
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.600]   like Coca-Cola is trying to sell Coca-Cola.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.340]   And at that time, there was no writings,
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.720]   there was nobody who was saying anything against it,
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.120]   so we're just like, oh, okay.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.160]   These are professors telling us
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.280]   that this is what we need to do.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.560]   And I remember that lady said,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.280]   this sounds like manipulation.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.800]   And then since then, we've heard stories
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.400]   of people who came into church,
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.720]   and maybe even supposedly committed to the church,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.340]   who fell out once they saw
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.460]   how the church did evangelism.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.960]   And I remember this one particular lady
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.660]   that there's an article written about her,
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.960]   saying that she left the church
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.260]   because she felt like she was manipulated into Christ,
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.840]   instead of presenting the truth.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:15.320]   The primary agency in which God has given us
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.360]   to bring people to Christ
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.760]   is a clear teaching of the word of God.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.000]   That's why a pastor, an evangelist,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.440]   must first and foremost be committed to the word of God.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.360]   It is the seed that is planted that bears fruit.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.740]   Not the planter, not the water,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.280]   these are all agencies that God used,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.440]   but it is the seed, the word of God,
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.860]   that either they reject or bears fruit.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.280]   Third, the primary work of the discipleship
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.640]   in the church must be the word of God.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.720]   In 2 Timothy 4.2, Paul tells Timothy,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.560]   as he is preparing to end his life,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.360]   not by him, but obviously he knows
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.160]   that execution is coming,
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.800]   and he's preparing his disciple, Timothy,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.920]   to go continue the work, and he says this.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.400]   Preach the word, be ready in season and out of season.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.540]   You know what in season and out of season means?
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.640]   Whether people respond or don't respond.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.880]   Whether people gather or they scatter.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.220]   Whether you think it works or it doesn't work.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.340]   He said, you preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.460]   If we evaluate everything based upon,
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:26.820]   did it work, did people like it?
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.420]   Are people more committed to church?
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.140]   Are people doing more of this because we did this?
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.260]   And we evaluate what is right and wrong
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.860]   based upon if it works by our standard,
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.820]   and then we will drift away from the word of God,
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.340]   which has happened in our generation.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.480]   When he says preach the word in season and out of season,
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.200]   he says whether the church grows or it dies.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.160]   Whether people convert or they persecute you.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.300]   Whether it makes you feel happy or discouraged.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.740]   Whether you are rebuked or whether you feel encouraged.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.200]   You preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.300]   The primary agent that God has ordained
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.580]   where he put his breath to bring life to repentant sinners
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.560]   is the word of God.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.500]   First Peter 2.2, like newborn babies,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.260]   long for the pure milk of the word
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.720]   so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.620]   You know what's interesting here
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.780]   is when he says to long for the pure milk.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.180]   Isn't that a waste of word?
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.020]   Why pure milk?
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:34.980]   Just milk, right?
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.820]   He said pure milk
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.840]   because he's trying to get sinners to the word.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:44.380]   I've preached sermons where I've had interpreters.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.600]   You know, whether it was in a Vietnamese church
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.820]   or I was at a Hispanic church
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:53.500]   or in India with various interpreters.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.580]   And usually I can only tell if they're doing a good job
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.820]   based upon body language, right?
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.700]   So if I say something, I've had good interpreters.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.340]   If I move left, they move left with me.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.620]   And if I get loud, they get loud.
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.780]   If I get soft, they get soft.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.940]   And I say, oh, they're a good interpreter.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:10.060]   And I can tell by the reaction from the people.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.900]   They say, oh.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.620]   But that's the only way I can see
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.740]   if they're interpreting well
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.740]   because I don't understand what they're saying.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.540]   But lately I've been trying to improve my Korean
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.740]   and I've done some sermons where I preach.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.540]   And obviously, my Korean is good enough
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.580]   to preach to Koreans here.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.460]   But in Korea, where they can't understand any English,
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.940]   I would have a native Korean speaker
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.860]   who would try to interpret for me.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.500]   And I realize how difficult that is
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.680]   because I understand them.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.860]   And I remember oftentimes I would say something
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:43.980]   and then they would say something
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.060]   and I did not say that.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.100]   And so I have to force myself.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.140]   Like, I don't wanna embarrass them.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.860]   I just keep going.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.540]   And I remember this one particular time
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.900]   and some of the Korean mission team was there
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:57.740]   and I was preaching
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.220]   and I said something very crucial to the sermon
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.540]   and the person who was interpreting
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.060]   said exactly the opposite.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.180]   And I say, if I don't correct this,
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.600]   my whole sermon's gonna not make any sense.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.980]   So I had to stop and I was like,
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.540]   oh, let me explain what I just said.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.360]   And I had to tell them in Korean, right?
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.980]   Now, the reason why I share all of this
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.980]   is now that had to be done
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.420]   because obviously they're not gonna understand what I say
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.720]   if I say it in English.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:29.060]   What you're hearing right now is an interpretation,
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.260]   what you're hearing now.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.580]   Somebody who's read the Word of God and understood it
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.100]   and then now telling you what it says,
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:34.980]   it's an interpretation.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.700]   So if your digestion of the Word of God
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.220]   is only through a preacher,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.020]   you will understand so much.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.860]   Because you're hearing through a filter,
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.580]   from my filter, from what I've seen,
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.420]   what I understood.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.340]   This is why we do inductive Bible study
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.460]   because we're trying to get you to see the Word of God.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:57.020]   Is there a difference between hearing from me
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.660]   and hearing from the interpreter?
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:01.820]   Of course.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.060]   It's gonna be much more clear
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.340]   when you hear it from my mouth
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.540]   instead of through an interpreter.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.620]   And so the Word of God,
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.460]   you can't just fall in love
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.000]   with the idea of being in love with the Word of God.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.380]   I know so many people who grew up in churches
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.780]   where the Bible was taught
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.540]   and they love the idea
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.940]   of being in love with the Word of God
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.740]   without being in love with the Word.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.660]   They themselves are not studying.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.780]   They themselves are not expositing.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:28.780]   They themselves are not digesting.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.300]   The only intake of the Word of God
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.900]   is through the preaching and teaching
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.520]   of other people who are interpreting for you.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.900]   That's why the primary feeding
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.720]   has to be the Word of God yourself,
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.940]   your daily intake, the Word of God.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.900]   Not just on Wednesday, but Monday through Friday,
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.860]   Monday through Saturday, Sunday,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.140]   that you yourself are in the Word of God.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.660]   Some people love theology.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.340]   They wanna hear systematic theology,
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.220]   how it's all put together.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.700]   Now, it's great because that's the accumulation
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.860]   of the study of the Word of God
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.100]   that gets us to systematic theology.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.100]   But before we get to systematic theology,
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.920]   you must be in the pure milk of the Word.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.720]   Or else, I'm just gonna have to tell you to trust me.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.860]   Right?
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.460]   'Cause I'm not a jerk,
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.620]   or maybe you don't think I'm a jerk, right?
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.780]   I trust him.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.940]   Why would you trust me?
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:22.840]   I don't trust myself, so why would you trust me?
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.740]   The Word of God is the primary agent
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.300]   that causes us to mature and grow.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.660]   Second Timothy 3, 16, 17,
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.320]   all scripture is given by God, and God breathed,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.940]   profitable for doctrine, reproof,
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:36.320]   for correction, instruction, righteousness,
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.500]   that the man of God may be complete,
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.240]   thorough, equipped for every good work.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.860]   In season and out of season,
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.140]   and then Hebrews chapter 4, 12,
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.500]   therefore the Word of God is a living and active,
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.900]   living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.420]   The reason why the Word of God
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.860]   is not interesting to many people
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.360]   is because they don't see it as living and active.
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.060]   And the reason why it's not living and active for many,
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.460]   I'm not saying for every single person,
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.060]   is because of unconfessed sins.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.060]   When I say unconfessed, I'm not saying
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.660]   that it never came out of your mouth.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.300]   You never really repented.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.920]   You never really repented.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:19.560]   And so you are holding on to a certain aspect of your life
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.120]   that you know that if you were in the presence of God,
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   who knows all things about you,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.280]   the first thing that's gonna come out of his mouth
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.260]   is why didn't you do this?
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.600]   But you pick and choose,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.960]   that these are things that I can give to God,
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.240]   and these are things I'm not gonna give to God,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.900]   and so maybe down the road, if I grow more,
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.040]   maybe I can.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.840]   But as a result of that, your heart has become hardened,
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.200]   and is no longer living and active.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.600]   You don't sense God speaking to you anymore.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.300]   It is not because God is hiding.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.040]   It is not because you're not exposed to the Word of God.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.240]   It's because you have shut the door of your heart
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.120]   to the Word of God.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.360]   And it says, it is sharper than any double-edged sword.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   The vision of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow,
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.760]   unable to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.940]   So the Word of God judges whose heart?
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.500]   Judges thoughts and intentions of their heart?
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.440]   No, you can only see what they're doing externally.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.780]   The Word of God cannot judge for you
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.540]   the thoughts and intentions of their heart,
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.360]   'cause you don't know that.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.200]   You can't see that.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.740]   Only the Holy Spirit can see that.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.660]   It judges thoughts and intentions of what?
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.760]   Your heart.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.000]   So when an individual is intaking the Word of God,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.040]   and he himself is not being convicted by it,
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   the Word of God becomes a resource
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.780]   to judge the thoughts of other people.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.840]   And the more you take of the Word of God,
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.160]   the more critical you become in your life.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.600]   Because I know the Word of God,
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.920]   and they're not applying it.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.760]   They're not doing this.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.840]   They're not acting like, they're not living like this.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.320]   And so you are unaware of your own bitterness,
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.560]   your own critical spirit, your own pride.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.280]   Jesus, when he was preaching,
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.040]   had more compassion to the tax collectors and the sinners,
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.160]   because they knew that they were in sin,
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.960]   and they were in need of grace.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.120]   And so God was more compassionate to them.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.000]   The people that he rebuked sharply over and over
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.600]   were the Pharisees, who knew the Word of God.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.840]   And they didn't think it applied to them.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.120]   They need salvation.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.160]   They need to be freed, unlike us.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.480]   The hardest people to reach
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.180]   are people who are in the church week in and week out,
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:42.520]   hardened in their heart because they refuse
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.440]   to allow the Word of God
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.660]   to penetrate deep parts of their hearts.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.160]   Bitterness, critical spirit, and pride
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.040]   is the greatest hindrance to religious people
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.660]   from experiencing the living and active Word of God.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.980]   Fourthly, primary work of an evangelist
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.220]   is to make the Word of God known and to make it clear.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.300]   You know, it says in 1 Corinthians 2, 1 through 5,
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.620]   and when they came, when I came to you,
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.180]   he's talking to, in Corinthians,
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.020]   brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.460]   or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.220]   For I determined to know nothing among you
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.940]   except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.780]   Let me stop right here.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.140]   He's talking during a period
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.740]   when wisdom and knowledge was put on a pedestal,
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.900]   where the celebrities of that time
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.600]   were people who studied philosophy.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.660]   So they would come into town,
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.420]   and they would actually get paid
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:44.620]   to stand in a marketplace and debate other scholars.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.940]   This is before TikTok.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.100]   This is before, you know, the internet,
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.820]   and they didn't have phones back then, right?
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.780]   So that was their entertainment,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.900]   to see scholars come into town
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.700]   and give them a platform, a marketplace.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.660]   So if you go to old, old area
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.620]   where Berea and Thessalonica,
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.940]   and when all those cities that you will,
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.140]   if they, the remains of their old cities remains,
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.260]   you will always see a little platform.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.260]   And that's where the scholars would stand.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.780]   Philosophers would come and stand up.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.620]   Well, this is my thought,
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.140]   and an opposing scholar would come,
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:16.980]   and they would debate,
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.500]   and people would sit there and just watch them.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.740]   And they were the LeBron James of that generation, right?
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.300]   They were the ones who were getting paid.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.740]   They were the ones that people adored.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.580]   And so Paul is speaking in that context.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.780]   When I came to you,
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.580]   I did not come in persuasive words of wisdom,
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.220]   but if Paul wanted to, he could have,
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:40.620]   because his discipler was Gamaliel,
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.340]   who was the top scholar,
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.860]   top scholar of all of Israel,
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.700]   was his direct teacher.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:52.700]   So if Apostle Paul wanted to destroy people with philosophy,
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.620]   he could have easily,
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.780]   but he knew that's not where the power was.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.320]   He said, I did not come with persuasive words of wisdom,
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.460]   but I determined to know nothing except Jesus Christ,
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.940]   and I was with you in weakness,
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.020]   and in fear, and in much trembling.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.760]   If anything, by human standards,
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.940]   he would have been disqualified.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.020]   A weakling who had fear,
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.220]   trembling because of his past persecution,
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.500]   and my message and my preaching
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.920]   were not with persuasive words of wisdom,
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.160]   but in demonstration of the spirit and of the power,
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.260]   and that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of man,
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.060]   but on the power of God.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.960]   Now we look at that, and we may first think,
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.460]   and project what we think he means by power.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.220]   Did he walk on water?
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.740]   Did he heal people?
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:38.220]   There are records in the book of Acts
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.460]   where they did perform miracles,
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.040]   but if you look at the record in a year and a half
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.140]   that he spends in Corinth,
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.500]   there's no record of any miracle.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.540]   If anything, he says in Acts 18.5, and in Corinthians,
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.860]   that he devoted himself to the complete teaching
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.820]   of the word of God.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:06:01.880]   We project what power is based upon our weakness.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:07.260]   So we can't walk on water, so obviously that's power.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.660]   We can't create things out of nothing,
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.140]   so obviously that's power.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.660]   But if you see it from God's perspective,
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.820]   all of that is nothing.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:19.080]   He just, by his word, he can tell the weather to change.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.820]   By his word, he created the universe.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.900]   Just by saying, "Be it."
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.180]   And he wasn't exhausted, he didn't need to take a break.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.740]   He just did it by his will.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.540]   And that's exactly what he said when they came
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:36.420]   to bring the paralytic to be healed,
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.380]   and Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.220]   Everybody's offended.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.940]   It's like, "That's not what we wanted."
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.740]   He said, "What is harder to do?
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.540]   "To say your sins are forgiven, or to heal this man?
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.940]   "But in order for you to know
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.460]   "that I have the power to forgive sins,
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.980]   "I will heal this man."
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.660]   The whole purpose of why he did it
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.660]   is so that they can see the real power.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.620]   The power behind Apostle Paul's preaching
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.620]   was not some magic, was not some healing, it was him.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.180]   How the gospel changed this man.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.980]   How was a man who had so much hatred in his heart,
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.220]   who was willing to murder for the name of God,
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:15.380]   and now is willing to be murdered to preach about this God?
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.980]   The greatest of sinners, according to his own mouth,
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.940]   became the greatest witness.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.320]   That's something that you cannot do.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.700]   God could have easily slapped his finger
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.780]   and performed miracles, but in order for us
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.200]   to have the power of the Word of God
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.660]   to forgive us our sins, the Son of God
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.140]   had to empty himself of his glory,
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.620]   walk a humiliating life, and then to be mocked,
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.080]   and then to be crucified,
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.380]   and then to take on our sins upon himself.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.260]   He needed to go through all of that drama
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.200]   in order to change us.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.500]   So the greatest miracle, greatest power
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.260]   behind the preaching of the Word of God
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.940]   is the changed life of the individuals
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:06.840]   who are preaching it.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   That's why we are called witnesses.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.900]   We don't just regurgitate information.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.140]   I went to seminary, and so I studied,
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.160]   and I can tell you 10 different ways to share the gospel.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.060]   That's not where the power is.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.260]   The power is what happened to you.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.860]   How did it affect you?
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.500]   How did the Word of God judge the thoughts
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.420]   and intentions of your heart?
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.280]   How is your life any different because you met Christ?
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.780]   That's where the power is.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.640]   So when you share the gospel,
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.260]   you're simply being a witness of that power
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.220]   in the Word of God.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   This is what happened to me.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.040]   And if he can save and love and be patient
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.180]   with a sinner like me, he can save you too.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.100]   He has ordained the Word of God
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.160]   and the witness of the power of the Word of God.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.280]   Jews look for signs, miracles.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:01.740]   Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.660]   The power is not in the organization.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.580]   The power is not in the giftedness.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.820]   The power is not in our experience, in our education.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.260]   The power is in the Word
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.060]   because that's what he has ordained.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.500]   But let me summarize all of this with the fifth
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.600]   and I believe the most important part
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.940]   of understanding this seed.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.840]   The primary purpose of the Word of God
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.900]   is to bring us to Christ.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.180]   You can spend all your life studying the Word of God
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.320]   and be more miserable because of the Word of God
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.100]   in your life than when you first started.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.500]   If the Word of God does not bring you to Christ.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.700]   Some of the most miserable people to be around
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.740]   are people who know the Word of God well.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.860]   They've studied it, they've dissected it,
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:52.380]   they've memorized it, and they know how to apply it
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.860]   to when, to whose life, and they know
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.620]   this is wrong 'cause of this, that's wrong 'cause of this,
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.420]   you didn't think right, this is the right theology,
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.940]   and they know how to apply and to judge
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.300]   what is right and wrong,
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.580]   but they themselves have not been affected by Christ.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.140]   It says in John 1:1 that in the beginning was the Word
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.400]   and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.020]   Jesus Christ is declared to us as the Word.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:19.260]   And then in John 1:14 it says, and the Word became flesh.
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:24.220]   Jesus became flesh, the Word became flesh
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.540]   and dwelt among us and we saw his glory,
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.540]   glory as to the only begotten from the Father,
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.660]   full of grace and truth.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.780]   So the Word of God is Christ.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.100]   Jesus himself says in John 5, 39 to 40,
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.540]   you search the scriptures because you think
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.060]   that in them you have eternal life.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.220]   It is these that testify about me
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.100]   and you are unwilling to come to me
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   so that you may have life.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.840]   The whole reason why so many of the first century Jews,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.380]   the Pharisees, the scribes, the teachers of the law
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.860]   missed him is because they were so focused on
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:01.920]   how to become righteous through the Word of God.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.780]   And Jesus said, you missed the whole point.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:06.820]   You missed the whole point.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.460]   You're evangelizing, you're praying, you're tithing,
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:12.620]   you're making disciples, you're fasting,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.420]   you're keeping the law,
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.460]   at least you think you're keeping the law,
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.060]   but you missed the main point.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.420]   All of it, he says, was about me.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.300]   If you come to a Bible teaching church
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.180]   and the intake of the Word of God causes you to be proud,
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:34.780]   you missed the whole point.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.940]   You can become proud because of knowledge,
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:40.980]   because of experience, because of giftedness.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.800]   Maybe even you think you bore fruit,
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.580]   but when you meet Christ, you can't be proud.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:53.860]   Automatically, you get humbled in the presence of God.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.420]   Automatically.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.820]   Because we worship and follow a God
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.700]   who emptied himself of his glory.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.100]   How can you be proud in the presence of that God?
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.460]   How can you be any different
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.620]   if our whole purpose of salvation is to draw near to him
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.180]   and to reflect who he is to the world?
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.340]   You cannot.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.900]   A proud man who is filled with the Word of God
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.180]   is more dangerous than a person who knows nothing
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:30.420]   because he uses the Word of God incorrectly.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:35.020]   Have you ever met somebody who knows the Bible so well
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.180]   and you hear people, it's like,
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.740]   I don't wanna go to that church that teaches the Bible
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.740]   because I don't wanna be like that guy.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.200]   Instead of attracting people to Christ,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.020]   that our knowledge and our presentation
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.100]   of the Word of God turns people off,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.660]   not only to Christ, but the Word of God itself,
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.540]   because it is used to condemn.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.580]   It gives us a critical spirit.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.060]   But the whole purpose of the Word of God
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.820]   is to bring us to Christ, more of Christ,
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.940]   to fall in love with Christ, to worship Christ,
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.900]   to obey Christ, to exalt Christ, to declare Christ.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:19.060]   If you miss that, you don't miss something important,
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.780]   you miss the whole point of our salvation.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.140]   In 2 Peter 1, 2-3, it says,
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.980]   "Grace and peace be multiplied to you
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.540]   "in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord."
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.220]   Not only our salvation, but our sanctification,
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.620]   our continued growth, he says, "In the knowledge."
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.820]   The word knowledge here is gnosko,
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.260]   and then they would put an epi in front of it,
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.940]   and whenever you see an epi in front of a word,
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.420]   it means to be intensified.
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:50.860]   So basically it means in a personal relationship
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.360]   with Jesus Christ, and an epi means intensely.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.140]   So your spiritual well-being, your maturity,
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.540]   depends upon your intimacy with Christ.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:05.700]   I don't care how much Bible you know.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.940]   I don't care how much theology that you can present.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.260]   I don't care how much you know, I just don't care.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:18.020]   If Christ is not exuding, if you are not the aroma of Christ
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.060]   wherever you are, you're doing disservice
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.020]   to the Word of God.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:27.980]   You know, I know there's quite a few Dodgers fans in here,
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.980]   and I know who you are, right?
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.900]   'Cause you can't hide it.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.260]   And I know who the Posers are, right?
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.300]   'Cause the Posers know everything about Otani.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:44.460]   They've memorized statistics, and they know all this stuff,
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.100]   but you know, I can tell if somebody is a true Dodgers fan
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:52.460]   is they get affected by the Dodgers
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.300]   when Otani's being investigated,
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.340]   and they're genuinely hurt.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.620]   This is their team.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.900]   There's an affection for this team, right?
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.060]   It's a little bit inappropriate,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.580]   but that there's an affection for this team,
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:06.740]   and you can tell.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:11.300]   You can tell if somebody's in love with this team,
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.620]   or they love the idea of being in love with this team.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.740]   There's a big difference, right?
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.740]   There's no different with Christ.
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.940]   There's a huge difference between somebody
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.260]   who has put it in their mind that I want to be known
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.140]   as somebody who loves Christ
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.060]   versus somebody who loves Christ.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.180]   There's a big difference.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:40.060]   You could tell when the name of Christ comes up.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.100]   You could tell in their eyes.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.940]   You could tell by the way they listen.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.740]   You could tell by the way they sing.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   You could tell how they're affected.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.140]   I say all of this because our danger
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.700]   in a Bible-teaching church is where you think
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.540]   that if we take a lot of intake of the Word of God,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.300]   that somehow we are maturing.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:10.700]   But if love for Christ isn't being added
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.260]   through the Word of God, you're missing the whole point.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.700]   And let me conclude with this, John 17:3.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.700]   "This is eternal life, that they may know you."
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:27.820]   The only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:32.820]   This is eternal life, to know Christ, to love Christ,
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:39.940]   to honor Christ, to proclaim Christ, to worship Christ.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:45.700]   So as we open up this parable,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.540]   I hope that that sets a good foundation
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.820]   in how people respond to this seed
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.180]   in the presentation of God's Word,
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.220]   who brings us to Christ,
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.780]   who perseveres to bear fruit in Christ,
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.660]   and who will fall away.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.660]   And we'll dive into that starting next week.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.500]   Let's pray.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:13.960]   Father, we come in weakness.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:19.180]   We come often entangled, distracted,
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.100]   concerned and worried for the affairs of this world.
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:27.540]   So we pray, Father God, that you would lift up our eyes,
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:32.320]   teach us, guide us, mold us, rebuke us, correct us,
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.900]   that we may persevere, Lord God, on the right path.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.560]   Lord, where else will we go?
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.320]   You have the words of life.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.380]   Help us, Lord God, in our weakness,
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:49.660]   to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.060]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:52.900]   That's all.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.720]   Stand up for the closing praise.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:18:01.680]   (upbeat music)
