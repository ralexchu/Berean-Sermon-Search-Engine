[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   >> Good morning.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Welcome to community church.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Before we get started, we have an announcement from our sisters.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Sisters?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Grace?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Let me do the other stuff and then maybe she'll come in before then.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Can somebody stick their head out and ask Grace to come in if you're outside?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Okay.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   All right.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   First of all, next Sunday is transformation.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Basically, it's a replacement for Halloween at our church.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And the theme of this year is Sola Fide.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   And so there's going to be a very brief teaching on that for our children and
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   for the parents as well.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They're still asking for volunteers if you still have interest in creating a
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   place of transformation for the children where they can come and play games.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   They're still taking that.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   But the sign up for that day is ending today.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So if you haven't signed up your children, if you want to do so,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   please do that by today.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And they are still taking candy and prizes for that.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And so if you go to the cafe, and as soon as you go into the left,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   there's kind of like a pile of candy there, and that's not for you.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Okay, so that's for the children.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So if you want to just drop it off, you can go there and just drop it off
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   there, and then they'll use that for this coming Sunday.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So next Sunday, the time will be from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And then there is an evangelism outing that's taking place on November 6th,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and our brother Jun-Yim is in charge of that.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   So if you're interested in coming and participating in that,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   please let him know.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   All of this stuff is on our website and our church app,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   so you can address that or look at that.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Our Bible study lab, again, in November 7th, that's happening at 2 p.m.,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   and then our Orphan Sunday is coming up,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and we will be taking an offering for that on November 7th.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Okay, so Grace has an announcement for our holiday outreach.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Good morning, church family.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   My name is Grace Kim.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I'm making this announcement on behalf of Women's Ministry for various holiday
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   outreach opportunities available to the whole body.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Oh, sorry, I ran in here.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Let me catch up.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So with the Thanksgiving and Christmas season quickly approaching,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   it's easy to become consumed with the busyness of family gatherings
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and celebrations.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   However, I pray that our body would keep in mind to let our light shine for
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Christ by bringing the beautiful message of the gospel to a dark world.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And I pray that these holiday outreach opportunities will serve as a way of
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   engaging our body of Christ out of an overflow of thankful hearts for the love
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   that we have first been shown.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   So this year we have five ways to engage our church members.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   The first is called Olive Crest.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Olive Crest is a Christian foster children agency in Santa Ana,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and they have requested therapy kits to be used by counselors during therapy
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   sessions with the foster children.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And they have also requested gift baskets,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   which will be handed out to the youth who will be transitioning out of foster
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   care.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   The second is Operation Christmas Child.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   This year we'll be providing shoebox gifts filled with toys,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   school supplies, and hygiene items for children worldwide.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And the shoeboxes will serve as a means of reaching out to children globally
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   through partnerships with local churches to bring them the good news of Jesus
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Christ.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And then the third is Angel Tree,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   where we'll be providing gifts to local children impacted by the incarceration
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   of a parent.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   We will purchase, wrap, and deliver gifts for these children on behalf of their
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   parents in prison to remind them -- to bring the hope of the gospel and also to
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   remind them that they are loved and valued.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And then the fourth is Orange County Rescue Mission.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   There are two opportunities here.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   The first is a lunch meal prep and service.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And then the second is an annual magic at the mission event where we would be a
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   personal shopper with the children and adult residents at the gift shop that's
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   already set up at the OC Rescue Mission, and as well as helping them gift wrap.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And then the last one, but not least, is a Breein,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   our church service project and homeless outreach.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   You can participate in two ways for this one.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Number one, you can make donations to put together care packages.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And then number two, you can go directly out onto the streets to reach out to the
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   homeless.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And please note that for several of these opportunities,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   they have deadlines approaching relatively quickly.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So we'll be tabling outside weekly in the courtyard for these opportunities
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   starting today after each service.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So please visit these tables for the details.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   [Applause]
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Okay, so as she mentioned, if you go outside,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   you'll see all these canopies that are set up to the left as you're coming in,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   or to the right.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And so that's where all the booths are.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   So if you go visit there, each one of these ministries are represented in
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   different tables, so you can do sign-ups over there.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Okay?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   All right, so let me pray for our offering,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   give you time to give electronically.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And for those of you who are visiting us for the first time,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   our physical offering box is in the back.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   It'll say "Offering."
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It looks like a little birdhouse, but that's the offering box.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   So if you have a physical offering and you want to drop it off,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   you can just drop it off there after the service.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Okay?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Gracious Father, you are truly deserving of our praise and worship.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Help us, Lord God, to consider your word, your spirit,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   and what you've done for us, that our worship, Lord God,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   would be an overflow of gratitude from our hearts.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Even in our giving, help us to give as an act of worship in spirit
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and in truth.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   May it be multiplied, 30, 60, 100-fold,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   that as we live in this dark world, as you warned us, Lord God,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   that because of increase of wickedness, that love of most will grow cold.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be deliberate in all that we do.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Even in this giving, may it be an act of worship that honors and glorifies you.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   [music]

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:24.460]   - All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.460]   We're gonna be reading from verse seven through 14,
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.460]   but the text that we're gonna be in this morning
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   is specifically in verse seven.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.460]   Hebrews chapter 13, verses seven through 14.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.460]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.460]   Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.460]   and God to you, and considering the result of their conduct,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.460]   imitate their faith.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.460]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.460]   Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.460]   for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace,
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   not by foods through which those who were so occupied
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.460]   were not benefited.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.460]   We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.460]   have no right to eat.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.460]   For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.460]   into the holy place by high priests as an offering for sin
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.460]   are burned outside the camp.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.460]   Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.460]   So let us go out to him outside the camp
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.460]   bearing his reproach.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   For here we do not have a lasting city,
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.460]   but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   Let's pray.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would anoint your word.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.460]   May it go forth with power, and with power change our hearts,
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   our minds, and our very lives for the sake of your name.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.460]   All right, so if we look at this text,
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.460]   one of the questions that I asked on the Facebook,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   just to prepare, I just want to give you a heads up
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.460]   that every Saturday night when I'm preaching,
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:12.460]   I'll give a little blurb about what to prepare for the next day.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.460]   So I highly encourage you to take a look at that
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.460]   and look at the questions.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.460]   You don't have to study through it,
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.460]   but if you take a look at it, I think it will better prepare you
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.460]   to be able to hear the message and kind of know
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.460]   a general outline of what we're doing.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.460]   One of the questions that I asked is,
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   there's a bunch of imperatives here to do certain things at the end.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   So if we look at it superficially, it may look like that the author
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.460]   is just kind of at the end of the letter,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.460]   and he has a bunch of things that he wants to get off his chest.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.460]   So he's done with the indicatives where he kind of taught the theology
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   and gave broad imperatives on what you ought to do,
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.460]   and then now he wants to get into specifics,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.460]   and he's run out of time, and he just kind of,
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.460]   you know, verse after verse, do this, do this, do this, do this.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   Superficially, it may look like that,
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.460]   but there is a cohesive unity of what he is saying.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.460]   It's at the end of the letter, and so typically,
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.460]   the thesis of the letter is usually in the very beginning
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.460]   or at the very end, right?
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.460]   And so, you know, he made it very clear to pay very close attention
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.460]   to what Jesus has to say, and then he goes into Christology
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.460]   of who Jesus is, he's superior over everything,
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.460]   and then now at the end of chapter 13, he's kind of concluding everything.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.460]   And so the conclusion of what he's been trying to say
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   through 13 chapters is really contained in this section.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:39.460]   And so the verse that kind of wraps up everything
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.460]   is really contained in verse 9 when it says,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.460]   "Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings,
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.460]   for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace."
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.460]   That really is a summary of everything that he's been trying to say.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   Remember that the warning that he has been giving us
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.460]   is do not drift, do not drift.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   How can we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.460]   And he keeps saying, "Do not drift, do not drift, do not drift."
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.460]   And so in saying that, everything that he says,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.460]   all the imperatives here really tie to that thing.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.460]   Do not be carried away by various strange teachings,
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.460]   and make sure that you're grounded and you're anchored in Christ
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.460]   and what Christ has done.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.460]   And so in doing so, he starts out by telling us in verse 7,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.460]   "Remember the leaders, remember those who led you,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.460]   who spoke the word of God to you,
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.460]   and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith."
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.460]   So later on he's going to talk about submitting to the elders of the church,
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.460]   the leaders of the church, but here in verse 7 he says,
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.460]   "Remember those who have gone before you,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   consider the end result, the result of their conduct."
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.460]   So he's referring not simply to the leaders that are leading them today,
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.460]   but he's talking about the people who have gone before them.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.460]   And the reason why he starts with that is because
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.460]   that was the very reason why they were strained.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.460]   In the very beginning of their faith,
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.460]   some of these leaders were suffering for the gospel
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.460]   and they were willing to stand with them,
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.460]   but as time went by, the suffering would not relent.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.460]   It got even worse.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   In fact, some of them were actually martyred for their faith.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.460]   And as their leaders started to die off one by one,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.460]   he's telling them, "Remember the result of their faith."
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   He's not telling them that, "Look at the perseverance of your leaders,
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.460]   that because they persevered and suffered for a little while,
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.460]   that God blessed them, answered their prayers,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.460]   they were able to come out of prison, take care of their children,
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.460]   and they lived happily ever after."
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.460]   He's saying, "Remember those people who have gone before you
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.460]   and were martyred for their faith."
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.460]   And as a result of that, the fruit that they bore.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:49.460]   So really, the only person that's going to be encouraged by this text is,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.460]   if you genuinely believe that the end result of suffering,
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.460]   that even if you die, it's worth it,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.460]   because you believe that there's true life in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.460]   This is not an encouragement for people who say,
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.460]   "You know what, look at the leaders and look at how great their life was,
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.460]   even though they sacrificed for a short period,
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.460]   that in the long run, they had a great life."
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.460]   That's not the point that he's trying to make.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.460]   He's actually telling them, "Look at the end result of their life,
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:22.460]   that even as they were martyred for their faith,
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.460]   that you ought to look at that and to mimic what they've done,
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.460]   to encourage them, not to be discouraged
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.460]   because of the suffering of those who went before them."
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.460]   And that's what he's really trying to say.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.460]   And so today, we're going to be looking at the three imperatives
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.460]   just in this verse to remember, to consider, and then to mimic.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.460]   But before we even jump into those three imperatives,
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.460]   one of the most common criticisms that I have heard
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.460]   through the years of Berean Community Church
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.460]   is that we are too slow in establishing leaders in our church.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.460]   And I've heard it all.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.460]   I've heard some people say, "We're slow in establishing leaders
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.460]   because Pastor Peter's an egomaniac.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.460]   He doesn't like to share his power."
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.460]   So I've heard that.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   I've heard some people say that, "I want to keep our power within the family."
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   So you have to be a family member in order to be a leader at this church.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.460]   Or another common thing that I've heard is that, "We don't know what we're doing."
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.460]   And so we don't disciple people, and therefore that's the reason
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.460]   why we don't establish leaders because we don't disciple people,
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.460]   and so we don't have enough people coming up.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.460]   And especially as our church grows, that comment may also grow along with that
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:39.460]   because the need for leadership is great.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.460]   But the reason why we are slow in establishing leaders is deliberate
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   because whenever you see in the Scriptures when Israel goes astray,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.460]   the first group of people that gets targeted for the judgment of God
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.460]   is always the leadership.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.460]   In Jeremiah 23, 1-2, it says,
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.460]   "Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture,"
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   declares the Lord.
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.460]   "Therefore, thus says the Lord God of Israel concerning the shepherds
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.460]   who are tending my people,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   'You have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not attended to them.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:17.460]   Behold, I am about to attend to you for the evil of your deeds,' declares the Lord."
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.460]   He blames the shepherds of Israel.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.460]   If you remember, Jeremiah is a weeping prophet because he kept on telling them
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.460]   that you're going astray and because you're not honoring God,
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.460]   judgment is coming, and foreigners are going to come
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.460]   and take you into their land.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.460]   But before he judges the nation of Israel, he says, "No, it's the leaders.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.460]   You're the reason why they are being scattered.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.460]   You're the reason because you're not shepherding.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.460]   You're not speaking my word."
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   1 Timothy 5-24, Paul warns Timothy,
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.460]   "Do not lay hands hastily because some men's sins are obvious."
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.460]   And you know, the sins that are obvious are easy to deal with
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.460]   because we see it coming a mile away.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.460]   It's the sins that trail behind them,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.460]   meaning that they're really good at covering up,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.460]   and it takes a while to reveal their character.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.460]   And it says those sins that trail behind them
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.460]   are the ones that destroy churches
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   because you establish them, and you don't really realize what's in them
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.460]   until they get squeezed or there's some conflict or there's something wrong,
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   and all of a sudden, all hell breaks loose.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.460]   So we are warned not to lay hands hastily,
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.460]   we're told not to put people into ministry hastily.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.460]   And he says, "If you do it hastily, you will also share in their sin
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.460]   by being hasty in putting people into leadership."
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.460]   James 3-1, he says, "Not many of you should desire to be leaders
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.460]   because as a leader, you will incur upon yourself stricter judgment."
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.460]   We all stumble, but as a leader stumbles, there are greater consequences.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.460]   Instead of stumbling a few people, you will stumble the whole church.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   So he says, "Not many of you should even strive to become leaders."
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.460]   I remember years ago, I think it was maybe around the 10th year of our church,
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.460]   Dr. Mantoya of Master Seminary was at a church that we were at,
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.460]   and he happened to be speaking,
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   and a fellow pastor of mine--a fellow pastor, a friend of mine--
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.460]   we ended up having dinner with Dr. Mantoya.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.460]   Dr. Mantoya probably was already in his 70s at that time,
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   and so he's been doing biblical ministry for many years.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.460]   So we sat with him and had dinner, and him and I--my friend and I--
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.460]   had the exact same question.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   And the question was, "Now you've seen the harvest,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.460]   and you've been doing biblical ministry for over 30-some years,
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:42.460]   would you be more patient in trying to get more younger guys into ministry,
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.460]   or would you be more strict and weed more people out?"
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   Without giving a second thought, he said, "I'd weed more people out."
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.460]   Now, both of us, we were thinking the same thing,
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   but we're younger pastors, and we didn't want to dare to say something like that.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   So we were thinking, and we just kind of nodded our head, and we asked him,
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.460]   "So why do you say that?"
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.460]   The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.460]   And so there is always pressure to establish leaders,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   because we need to plug up holes.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.460]   We need people to lead.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.460]   But the reason why our churches are in the condition that we are in now
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   is that because the harvest is full, harvest is plenty,
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.460]   we just want to plug up whoever, who's the next best person,
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   and then plug them in.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.460]   And then you may fix the temporary problem,
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.460]   but in the long term, you've destroyed the church,
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   because you've got the wrong people in the right place at the wrong time.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.460]   And so we want to be careful.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.460]   It's better to have lack of leadership
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   than to have the wrong leadership in the wrong place
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.460]   that will lead the church in the wrong direction.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.460]   So we are deliberate in being very slow, keeping accountable.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.460]   We want to make sure that we know the sins that are obvious
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.460]   and the sins that trail behind them
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.460]   so that the men who are coming into leadership are tested
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.460]   through various things, tested at home, tested with their wives,
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.460]   possibly with their children, tested when they are criticized,
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.460]   tested when they are weary,
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   because whenever a church goes astray,
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.460]   the first people that get targeted for judgment are the leadership.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.460]   1 Timothy 4, 16, Apostle Paul says,
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:25.460]   "Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.460]   Persevere in these things, for as you do this,
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.460]   you will ensure salvation both to yourself and for those who hear you."
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.460]   Did you notice that?
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.460]   Your teaching and your conduct has eternal consequences.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.460]   That's what he's saying.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.460]   It has eternal consequences.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.460]   You will save yourself and save your hearers.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:50.460]   And that's why he says, "Be careful in establishing leaders."
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.460]   In doing so, there's three things that he mentions here
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.460]   that we are called to do, that we need to be careful to do.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.460]   You notice here the first thing is,
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.460]   "Remember those who lead you who spoke the Word of God to you."
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.460]   He says, specifically, he points out,
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.460]   "Those who led you were the ones who spoke the Word of God to you."
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:16.460]   Those who led you are the ones who spoke the Word to you.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:23.460]   Today, sad to say, and I think many of you who've hopped from church to church
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.460]   will testify that we are in a generation where the Word of God
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.460]   has been squeezed out of many churches.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.460]   I've actually talked to pastors, young and old,
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:38.460]   who have officially said that they don't do Bible study anymore at their church
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.460]   because people are not interested.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.460]   They won't come if we exposit the text.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.460]   I've actually talked to a pastor who sat through,
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.460]   or at least went through some of our teaching in the book of Isaiah
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.460]   and our Bible study, and he was surprised.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.460]   He listened to the teaching that I gave in the book of Isaiah,
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:59.460]   and he said, "They come to this?" That's what he said.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.460]   I said, "Yeah, they come to it."
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:05.460]   He's like, "Why? I don't understand. They don't come."
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:09.460]   Sad to say, we live in a generation where the Word of God has been squeezed out
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   because if we are too serious about the Bible, the seekers won't come.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.460]   So we've watered down the church, the gospel, the Bible,
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:23.460]   to the lowest common denominator for those who wish to be at church
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.460]   but may not be serious about their faith
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.460]   so that they can also be welcome and be a part of the community.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:34.460]   As a result of that, the Word of God has been squeezed out.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.460]   In the book of Amos, and this is a book,
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.460]   if you don't know the content of the book of Amos,
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.460]   I strongly recommend to go do quiet time in this book
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   because God speaks to the nation of Israel during a period
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.460]   when they were very active in their religious activity at the temple.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.460]   They were done fighting, they were pretty wealthy,
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.460]   and as a result of enjoying this peace,
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.460]   they were going to the temple and making many sacrifices,
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.460]   but yet God says that He is angry with the nation of Israel,
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.460]   that in their sacrifices it had nothing to do with God,
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.460]   that He actually says that their assemblies are evil assemblies,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   that as they are singing to God, God says, "Take away from me your noise,"
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.460]   because they strayed away from what God desired.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.460]   And so He would bring judgment to the nation of Israel,
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.460]   but at the end, the final judgment of the nation of Israel
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.460]   is described in Amos chapter 8, 11 through 12.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.460]   He says, "Behold, days are coming, declares the Lord God,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:38.460]   when I will send a famine of the land, not a famine for bread or a thirst for water,
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.460]   but rather for hearing the words of the Lord.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.460]   People will stagger from sea to sea and from the north even to the east.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   They will go to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, but they will not find it."
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.460]   He said that was the final judgment.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.460]   You keep ignoring my word.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.460]   You keep straying away from what I say.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.460]   You keep hardening your heart from the prophets that I sent to you.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.460]   He said the final judgment is He gives them over, okay?
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.460]   Then there's going to be a famine of the word.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.460]   You're going to go look for it to see what God has to say,
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.460]   and you're not going to be able to find it.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.460]   Jeremiah 23, 36 says this,
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.460]   "For you will no longer remember the oracle of the Lord,
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.460]   because every man's own word will become the oracle."
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.460]   In other words, we're going to be in a relativistic community
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.460]   where the word of the Lord is whatever you make of it,
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.460]   whatever you think is right.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.460]   If it bothers you, God could not bother you.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.460]   How can a God of love say this?
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.460]   Why would a God of love say that?
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:40.460]   Not based on the word of God, but your own sense of moral compass
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   is going to be the word.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.460]   He said because the word of God has been ignored,
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   people are not going to be able to filter to know
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.460]   if this is biblical or not.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.460]   Every man's own word will become the oracle,
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.460]   and you have perverted the words of the living God,
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.460]   the Lord of hosts, our God.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:02.460]   Doctrinal relativism is what's killing the church.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.460]   We have been so concerned about making the church
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.460]   as pleasant as possible to as many people as possible
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.460]   that there are no lines today in our generation
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.460]   between a Christian and non-Christian.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.460]   So even the term evangelical,
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.460]   the term was given in order to distinguish
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:28.460]   between genuine Christians and the cults.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:34.460]   Today, among the evangelicals, the title evangelical,
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.460]   they said over 70% believe that you can get to heaven
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.460]   without Christ.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.460]   So the term evangelical no longer is a description
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.460]   of Christians.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.460]   It's just a term who profess to be Christians.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.460]   Doctrinal relativism is killing the church,
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.460]   and more and more I hear even pastors saying
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.460]   and advertising their church and saying,
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.460]   "We're not doctrinal,"
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.460]   or "We don't have creeds in our church."
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.460]   What they mean by that is we're not judgmental.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.460]   That's what they mean by that.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.460]   We don't judge like these legalists.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.460]   We're not overly concerned about every little detail
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.460]   of the doctrine because we're about Jesus' love.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.460]   So we're not that.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.460]   They advertise themselves as being non-doctrinal
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.460]   because the worst thing that you can accuse a Christian of
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.460]   in that camp is being not loving.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.460]   Usually, you know, I've had many conversations
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.460]   with pastors and say, "Oh, we're non-doctrinal."
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.460]   I would ask them, "Do you have women preaching
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   at your church?"
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.460]   They said, "Well, it doesn't matter."
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.460]   I said, "Well, I'm just asking you,
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.460]   do you have women preaching at your church?"
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.460]   They said, "Well, I don't know."
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.460]   I said, "Well, I haven't heard that in a while."
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.460]   "That's your doctrine.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.460]   You may not have that on your paper,
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.460]   but you have women preaching at your church.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.460]   That's your doctrine.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.460]   Do you baptize infants?"
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.460]   It's like, "It doesn't matter.
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.460]   Our church doesn't matter."
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.460]   "But do you baptize infants?"
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.460]   "Yes."
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.460]   "Then that's your doctrine.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   How can you be so narrow and baptize infants?
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.460]   How can you be so judgmental and allow women to preach?
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.460]   That's your doctrine.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.460]   You may not put it on paper.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.460]   What you mean is doctrine don't matter to you.
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.460]   Of course, doctrine don't matter.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.460]   We just love Jesus."
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.460]   And when they say that, I said,
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.460]   "Well, which Jesus are you referring to?
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   The Jehovah Witness Jesus?
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.460]   The Mormon's Jesus?
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.460]   Are you talking about the modalistic Jesus,
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.460]   the tritheistic?
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.460]   Which Jesus are you referring to?
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.460]   The Trinitarian Jesus that the church has fought for
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.460]   for centuries.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   People have given their lives because that's what the Bible teaches.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   You're saying about that Trinitarian doctrine
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.460]   doesn't matter to you because you're non-doctrinal."
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:38.460]   They said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.460]   We wouldn't say that.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.460]   We believe in the Trinity."
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.460]   So you are doctrinal.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.460]   Christians have fear that being too precise in doctrine
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.460]   is somehow going to divide the church.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.460]   Guess what?
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   Doctrines are given to us to divide the church,
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.460]   to divide between truth and falsehood,
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.460]   to what is true and what is false.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:05.460]   There is no group, there is no individual who is non-doctrinal.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   Years ago, early on in our church,
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.460]   when we were having membership,
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.460]   we had a lady--some of you guys who have been here a bit longer
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:17.460]   will remember--we had a lady who was confessing to be a Hindu
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.460]   who took our membership class.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.460]   Initially, she said she wasn't a Christian,
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.460]   but she was interested.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.460]   She sat through all of our membership class.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.460]   Back then, it was about 10 weeks,
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   and about an hour, hour and a half each class.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.460]   It was pretty long, so she sat through all of it.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.460]   As she was progressing, she was starting to confess
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.460]   and say that, "I believe I'm a Christian."
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.460]   We started to celebrate and say, "This Hindu lady came to Christ.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.460]   We're excited."
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.460]   After she took the class, we usually have--
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   we have an assignment where we have to sit down, talk to her,
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.460]   make sure that the testimony is true.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.460]   One of the leaders sat down with her and began to ask her,
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   "Oh, we're so excited about you that you want to become a Christian."
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   She said, "Yeah, I want to be a member of this church."
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.460]   We started to dig a little bit and found out
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.460]   that she still considers herself a Hindu.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:11.460]   I said, "How are you a Hindu and a Christian at the same time?"
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   Basically, what she did was she took all the different idols.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.460]   She just added Jesus to her idols.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.460]   She liked the church.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.460]   She liked the people at the church.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.460]   She liked the doctrine of grace.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.460]   She said, "I love that, but I still want to embrace the idols
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.460]   that she has in her life."
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:31.460]   We had to basically shut the door and say, "You're not a Christian."
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.460]   If you don't embrace the Christ of the Bible,
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:38.460]   you're not embracing Christ at all.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:43.460]   We live in a theological relativism where we think
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:48.460]   the godly thing to do is to draw no lines.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.460]   Let's not be doctrinal because doctrine divides.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:57.460]   Let me tell you what God says in Jeremiah 23, 16-17.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   It is so precise.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.460]   Listen carefully or read carefully what he says.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   An indictment against the leaders.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.460]   "Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'Do not listen to the words of the prophets
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   who are prophesying to you.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.460]   They are leading you into futility.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   They speak a vision of their own imagination,
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   not from the mouth of the Lord.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.460]   They keep saying to those who despise me,
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   'The Lord has said, 'You will have peace,'
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.460]   and as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:26.460]   they say, 'Calamity will not come upon you.'"
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.460]   Jeremiah is known as what kind of prophet?
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:35.460]   He's known as the weeping prophet.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:38.460]   I've never heard anybody come into ministry saying,
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.460]   "I want to be like Jeremiah."
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.460]   They want to be like Apostle Paul, even if he pours his life out,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.460]   plant churches, die in glory.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.460]   We're willing to do that.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.460]   Jeremiah wept all his life.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:56.460]   God told him to do strange things to convey the judgment that's coming,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.460]   and he wept the whole time.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   And the biggest thorn on his side were these false prophets
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:06.460]   that kept on contradicting him, saying, "No, he doesn't speak for God."
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   And so, just like Paul warned Timothy that people are going to come,
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.460]   and they're going to gather around themselves,
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.460]   teachers are going to tickle their ears,
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.460]   and when they tickle their ears, what are they telling them?
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.460]   "God loves you, has a wonderful plan for your life."
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.460]   The message in itself is not wrong.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.460]   "God loves you, Israel. You're the apple of his eye."
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.460]   That message in itself is not wrong.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:31.460]   But it was given to the right people at the wrong time.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:35.460]   God sent the prophet Jeremiah to warn them.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.460]   If they don't turn from their sins, captivity and judgment is coming,
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.460]   and the false prophets, in order for their own personal glory,
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:46.460]   in order to be loved by the people, what he's saying is wrong.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.460]   And so God says to Jeremiah, "Do not listen to them.
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.460]   They are not speaking on my behalf."
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.460]   Jeremiah 23, 21, he says, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.460]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied."
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.460]   They're not speaking the word of God.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.460]   They're telling you what they think you want to hear.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:12.460]   They're telling you what they think is going to draw as many people to them as possible.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   And he says, "Do not listen to them."
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:19.460]   Jeremiah 23, 30-31, "Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets," he clares the Lord,
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:24.460]   "who steal my words from each other."
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.460]   "Behold, I am against the prophets," he clares the Lord,
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:30.460]   "who use their tongues and declare the Lord declares."
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.460]   Does that sound anything like what's going on today?
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.460]   You know, years ago, it took a lot of work to be a heretic.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.460]   It took a lot of work because you had to be gifted.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.460]   You have to be charismatic.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.460]   You have to first have a large following locally.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.460]   And you have to have done that for a certain period of time where you have a large following,
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.460]   and then people start hearing about you in different cities,
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.460]   and then you write a book, you go start going to conferences.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:02.460]   And so it took a long time for a heretic to rise up in the ranks and then start to have influence.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:09.460]   Today, you can have a 20-year-old on a blog that got a large following on TikTok
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:14.460]   because he did some silly dance, and then all of a sudden he writes a blog and it becomes popular,
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.460]   and then people in his generation listen to it.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:17.460]   That sounds about right.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.460]   So you have a generation of people who can't filter what the Word of God says
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.460]   because the Word of God has been taken out of the church.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:30.460]   And so today, you can instantly have national and international influence
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:36.460]   because you have a church filled with people who can't tell if this is from God or not.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:37.460]   So they quote each other.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.460]   They quote the other false prophets, all their books and all their people,
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   but they do not know what the Word of God says.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:50.460]   Our church, Berean Community Church,
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.460]   typically when I meet somebody who's never heard that word, I say, "Oh, what's your church name?"
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.460]   I say, "Berean Community Church."
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.460]   They say, "Oh, yeah, Korean."
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.460]   No, Berean.
[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   "Buh," not "Kuh."
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460]   Berean Community Church.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   And the reason why a lot of people don't know that name is because it is an obscure name in the Bible.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.460]   It's not everywhere.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.460]   It's mentioned in Acts 17 and 11.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.460]   And even in that verse, it's not a big verse.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.460]   If you look at Paul's ministry, he was in Thessalonica doing ministry,
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   and they were considered the model church, remember?
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.460]   Their faith is being proclaimed all throughout Macedonia.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.460]   Their love is growing more and more.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.460]   But he had to leave that church because of heavy persecution.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.460]   And in order to protect the church that was in Thessalonica, he runs away from persecution,
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:41.460]   and he happens to land in this obscure little city called Berea.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:49.460]   And in Berea, he says in Acts 17, verse 11, that's the verse that our church name is, where we take our name,
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   he said, "Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica."
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.460]   Remember, Thessalonica was the model church.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:03.460]   They were the church in Macedonia, but they were more noble-minded, and only one thing is mentioned.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:10.460]   "For they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were true."
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.460]   Apostle Paul said these were more noble-minded. For what reason?
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.460]   For questioning them.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.460]   You can imagine if you were an apostle and you come in and said, "The Word of God says this."
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:26.460]   It's like, "Does it really say that? How dare you question me?
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   I'm an apostle. I've been stoned, dragged into prison, shipwrecked,
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.460]   and you're going to question me?"
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:41.460]   Inside, he says, "They were more noble because their authority was from the Word."
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.460]   And he said they were more noble in character because they questioned.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:50.460]   That their strength, their foundation, their authority came from the Word of God.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:56.460]   That's where they were more noble-minded. That's why we decided to choose that as our church name.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:03.460]   Apostle Paul says in Acts 20, 29-31, I'm not going to read that passage for the sake of time,
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.460]   but as he is headed toward Rome, knowing that he's going to be in prison,
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.460]   he spends the night with the elders of Ephesus, and he tells them that,
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   "After I leave, savage wolves are going to come in, introducing heresy to you."
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.460]   And then verse 31, "Therefore be alert."
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.460]   Be alert. They're going to come, and they're going to savage your church.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.460]   You know what the savage church that he's referring to, you know what the heresy he's referring to?
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:39.460]   He's talking to Judaizers. Judaizers were basically Jews who embraced Christianity
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.460]   without letting go of their Jewish past. So on the surface, it doesn't look that bad.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   They believe in Christ. They believe in the Atonement. They believe in the Resurrection.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.460]   They believe in the church, but they just refuse to let go of their past.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:56.460]   So they say, "Well, you still have to be circumcised. You still have to keep the Sabbath.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.460]   You still have to keep the dietary laws." But Apostle Paul says of that in Galatians,
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   "If anybody comes to you, preaches a different gospel than what I preach to you, let him be anathema."
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:14.460]   Even if it's me or an angel of God. If they contradict the Word of God in the gospel, let him be anathema.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.460]   Anathema basically means to be accursed, condemned.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.460]   The modern understanding of that would be to go to hell. That's what that means.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   It was the severest judgment that you can give, and Apostle Paul says that twice.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.460]   And you know who he rebukes with that? Apostle Peter.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:39.460]   Apostle Peter is the most respected apostle among the apostles.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:44.460]   I mean, if there's anybody that you would want to excuse, and not to shame publicly,
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:49.460]   it would be an Apostle Paul, Apostle Peter. But he calls him out publicly.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.460]   Because even Apostle Peter is not above the gospel.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:58.460]   Because he was in leadership, that his confrontation, he refused to sit with the Gentiles to eat.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   That's all he did. He just wouldn't eat with the Gentiles.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.460]   Because he was concerned about the Judaizers. That was very influential in the church.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.460]   That somehow, that he's going to be shunned by them.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:17.460]   And the other one, Barnabas. Barnabas was the one who stood up for him, when other people couldn't believe him.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.460]   How can this guy who was trying to kill us and murder us, how can he be representing us?
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.460]   Barnabas stood up and he testified. He's like, no, I can vouch for him.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.460]   Genuine conversion happened. So these two men, if there's any two people that Apostle Paul would have been afraid
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.460]   to question publicly, it would have been Peter, it would have been Barnabas.
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   And I think God did that on purpose.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:46.460]   To sanctify him and to sanctify us.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.460]   That the word of God has to be held up higher than any man.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:57.460]   And so Peter and Barnabas were called out for eternity in the book of Galatians,
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:04.460]   that they compromised. And by doing so, they may pervert the gospel.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:12.460]   That the word of God, this gospel of God has to be placed above any human being.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:16.460]   He says that the laughter got bigger, right?
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:20.460]   The first one you probably thought, oh, Pastor Peter didn't get enough sleep.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.460]   So he's probably said that wrong. Gospel of James.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   I know there's James, I don't know if it's the gospel, maybe he's saying it wrong.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.460]   Maccabees, for sure he's wrong. Maccabees.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   Now let me ask you, if you're sitting here and you did not know that this is not in Scripture,
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:46.460]   you shouldn't have strong opinions about what the word of God says or does not say.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.460]   You do not know the content of what the word of God says.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.460]   You do not know the content of the word of God, period.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.460]   You should not have strong opinions, I don't think God says that.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:02.460]   Again, we live in a generation of so many opinions with so shallow understanding of the word of God,
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:08.460]   and this is the reason why so many bad doctrines are coming into the church.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.460]   And I blame the leaders for that.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:16.460]   If you did not know that this is in Scripture, and you're a younger Christian,
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.460]   you don't need to be ashamed. Because part of why you commit to the church,
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.460]   why you give yourself to the teaching every week, is so that you can learn.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.460]   But the problem is, when you become a Christian in this generation,
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   your learning period is very short, and then after that you become a teacher.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.460]   We need to know what the word of God says.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.460]   We need to understand what the word of God says.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:45.460]   A lot of the things that you may be thinking is right or wrong may be a quote from other people.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.460]   And it may be people that God never sent.
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:51.460]   They just are very articulate. They just have a large following.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:55.460]   They wrote a bestseller, so therefore they have a voice in our generation.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   But you do not know what the word of God says. You and I must be Bereans.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:04.460]   If our knee-jerk reaction to any doctrine makes us feel uncomfortable,
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.460]   the next question should be, "Is it biblical?"
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.460]   Not, "I don't like it," or, "I like it." Is it or is it not biblical?
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:18.460]   And if we're not able to answer that question, we should not have strong opinions.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:30.460]   But having said that, we live in a generation where we are more than willing to excuse bad doctrine if they have good life.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.460]   You see someone say, "They teach weird things, but look at their church.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.460]   Look how many people came to Christ. Look how influential they are."
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:45.460]   So because they are very influential, we excuse bad doctrine.
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:50.460]   I mean, that's how the church has become what it is today.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:57.460]   We must never excuse bad doctrine because of who they are.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:03.460]   Even Apostle Paul, even Barnabas, even an angel, he says, "Let him be anathema."
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:09.460]   Because once the word of God is perverted, then the church gets perverted.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:16.460]   But having said that, we should never excuse their conduct because they have good doctrine.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.460]   He says to consider the result of their conduct and mimic them.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:27.460]   Consider. The word "consider" here is not just casually look. It means to intently examine.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:32.460]   Hebrews 12.2, that same word is translated, "Fix your eyes on Jesus."
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:37.460]   Intently look upon them. 1 John 3.1, same word, "Behold."
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.460]   "Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us."
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:47.460]   Look and examine carefully. Look at what they preach. Look at how they live.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.460]   See if it's consistent. See if their theology and their life is consistent.
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.460]   You can have a great sermon and have a lousy life.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:00.460]   And you can have a great life and have lousy, lousy theology.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.460]   Neither should never be excused.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:14.460]   Matthew 7.15 says, "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:21.460]   The Bible clearly says, when deception comes, it's going to come in the name of righteousness.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   It's going to come saying that this is from God.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   The most destructive things that come into church are people who are very well respected in Christian community.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:41.460]   So therefore, if you do not know the Word of God, if you're not growing in understanding of what the Word of God says,
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:48.460]   when these ravenous wolves come, what's going to end up happening is, "I like that guy. I like this guy."
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   So whatever your prejudice is, that's what's going to blind you to go down that path.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.460]   Because the Word of God is not your filter.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.460]   The filter is your own sense of right, your own sense of wrong.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   So if you have a picture of God, He loves unconditionally, and He would never judge.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:13.460]   So whatever sounds harsh to you is not from God.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.460]   Or you can err on the other way. You know what I mean?
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.460]   Jesus flipped over tables, so He's flipping over tables every day.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   And there's no grace in that either.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:30.460]   And we can err on either way when the filter isn't the Word of God.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:36.460]   But having said that, does their life match what they preach?
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   Well, what does He mean? What conduct? What are some of the things that we should be looking for?
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:46.460]   Well, we don't have to look far because Paul describes it in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:54.460]   He was being accused of being a false prophet, and so in defense of the gospel that he was preaching,
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   he lists out, in defense, his life.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   So therefore, they need to pay attention to what he says.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.460]   So I broke it up into three parts.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:07.460]   1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 through 4, he says,
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:10.460]   "For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not in vain,
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.460]   but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:21.460]   As you know, we had the boldness in our gut to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.460]   For our exaltation does not come from error or impurity or by way of deceit,
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.460]   but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak,
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:32.460]   not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts."
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:38.460]   So the first thing that he says is, every time Apostle Paul defends his ministry,
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.460]   he starts with his suffering.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:45.460]   Well, how do you know? How have they been approved that they're not speaking in error,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.460]   that they're not doing this for their selfish gain?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.460]   He says, because there was no gain for them,
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.460]   that they ended up sacrificing everything, even their life, preaching this gospel.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.460]   Now, that doesn't make the doctrine right,
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:04.460]   but he says the evidence of their own heart was proven by their willing to sacrifice and to suffer.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.460]   So that's the first thing that he says.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:13.460]   So if a man comes to you and his whole purpose is to gain people, more people to come to his church,
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   then immediately he's going to be tempted to tickle your ears.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   Because if I say anything that's offensive, some of you may leave.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.460]   If we do anything in the church that doesn't attract the seekers, then they're going to leave.
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.460]   So first thing that he says, in every instance where Apostle Paul defends himself,
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.460]   he starts with his credential of suffering.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.460]   Look at what we sacrifice. Look at people who died in preaching this gospel.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   So they believe that it was true.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:49.460]   You know, usually when a young man says he wants to go into ministry,
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:56.460]   one of the first things that I warn him about is, are you ready to suffer for Christ?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:02.460]   Different people may suffer in different ways, but you need to be willing to suffer.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:06.460]   If you're going into ministry, and this is not true only of people who are going into ministry,
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.460]   but if you're going into ministry, you have to come into ministry and say,
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:13.460]   "Lord, hear my, send me."
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   Every other family, they'll choose churches based upon what they think is best for their family.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:24.460]   Do they have Sunday school? Or is there a good women's program?
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   Is there good marriage counseling? Are there good things, the Bible being taught?
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:35.460]   And so when you look at the totality of the church, is this somewhere that my whole family could benefit from?
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.460]   There's nothing evil, there's nothing wrong or doctrinally wrong about any of that.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:45.460]   But if you're going into full-time ministry, you don't choose church based upon what you think is best for your family.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.460]   You choose church based upon where the greatest need is.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.460]   Where's the greatest need?
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.460]   So the greatest need may not be here.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.460]   The greatest need may be overseas.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.460]   The greatest need may be in an area where there is lack of churches.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.460]   The greatest need may be in churches where they don't have proper leaders and teaching.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.460]   So we choose based upon the greatest need for that area,
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:16.460]   which may mean greater suffering for your children, greater hardship for your wife.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:21.460]   They may not have people that are your age that are in that place.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.460]   So you may not have the community that you desire.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.460]   But if you're coming into ministry thinking, "I can only serve God if my children are taken care of,
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:32.460]   my bills are paid, my wife is taken care of, and we have the perfect Sunday school,
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:37.460]   and so in that context I want to preach the Lord with boldness."
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:43.460]   Then you do not want to go into ministry because you have to come into ministry saying, "Here am I. Send me."
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.460]   And so Apostle Paul says the proof that his heart was in the right place
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:51.460]   was that he was willing to suffer and die for the cause of Christ.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.460]   Secondly, that his primary concern is not praise of men.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:01.460]   "For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with pretext of greed.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.460]   God is witness. Nor do we seek glory from men, either from you or from others,
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:11.460]   even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority."
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.460]   He said he's not a man pleaser.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.460]   If you're a man pleaser, you cannot lead.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.460]   Because Paul says to Timothy to preach the word in season and out of season.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:28.460]   If you are only willing to preach in season, in season meaning when people are thanking you,
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.460]   and praising you, and there's benefits, and you see fruit,
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.460]   and that's the only time you're willing to preach the clear word of God,
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:38.460]   then you cannot lead because there are many times when it's not in season.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:41.460]   That because of what you say, people may leave.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   They may be offended. People may get hurt.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   And as a result of that, you're going to suffer.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.460]   That your children are going to suffer.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.460]   Because you're not going to have the financial means to take care of your family.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   But if you are a man pleaser, you cannot lead.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   Because leader means you have to lead in season and out of season.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.460]   You have to stand for truth in season and out of season.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.460]   Whether it empties the church or gathers the church.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.460]   We are representative of Christ.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:15.460]   Our primary goal is not to fill this room with as many people as possible.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.460]   God calls us to represent Him.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:22.460]   There are periods when people hated Jesus.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:28.460]   If they hate Jesus and they love you, you are not a servant of Christ.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.460]   If they have no interest in Christ but they're very interested in you,
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.460]   then you are not a servant of Christ.
[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.460]   If preaching Christ drives many, many people away,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.460]   and yet many, many people are coming to you,
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.460]   then you are not a servant of Christ.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.460]   The second test is, is he a man pleaser or is he a representative of Christ?
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.460]   Thirdly, does he love as Christ loved?
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:57.460]   But we prove to be gentle among you as nursing mothers tenderly cares for our own children.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.460]   Having so fond an affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.460]   not only the gospel of God but also our own lives.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.460]   And then he says our labor and hardship, how working night and day
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.460]   so as not to be a burden to you, any of you,
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.460]   we proclaim to you the gospel of God.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:18.460]   And then at the very end, verse 11, he says he treated them as father would his own children.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.460]   He loved them dearly.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:23.460]   He loved as Christ loved them.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.460]   You know, in the Western culture that you and I are in,
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.460]   you know, even when I was in seminary,
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   you know, it's almost like business, like how much should a pastor get paid?
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:36.460]   And I remember I had a classmate who spent the whole semester
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.460]   doing a paper on how much should a pastor get paid?
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.460]   And there were other different philosophies.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.460]   And he did an excellent job.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:49.460]   He really, you know, that could have been a book.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.460]   At the end of the day, I'm like, of all the things that you could have written
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.460]   and dedicated your semester about, that it was about that he had interest in.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:01.460]   Again, you know, I judged him.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.460]   I mean, there was a need for that, but it was just like, oh, you know,
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:07.460]   that was something that he was very, very interested in.
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.460]   And like what is a job description?
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.460]   And I remember an older pastor told me,
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.460]   make sure your job description is very clear,
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.460]   that you're going to go there and teach, you're going to do this,
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.460]   and then so that you're not responsible for this and that.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:22.460]   And, you know, every once in a while, somebody, a younger pastor would ask me,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.460]   like, what is the job description?
[01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.460]   Pastor Peter, what do you do after Sunday?
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.460]   You know, I get that question every once in a while, right?
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:33.460]   I play golf.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.460]   I don't play golf, right?
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.460]   So what do you do?
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.460]   What is your job description?
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.460]   Let me ask you, especially mothers.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:44.460]   This is true of mothers and fathers, but mothers in particular.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.460]   What is your job description?
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.460]   Put that on paper, what you do.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:51.460]   What is your job description?
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:57.460]   I make breakfast, do the laundry, make sure the kids don't kill themselves, right,
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   feed them dinner, make sure they go to bed.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.460]   Is that an accurate description of what you do?
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:04.460]   Part of it.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:08.460]   Can you describe what a mother does for their children?
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.460]   You can't.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   Because sometimes you're a chauffeur if they need rides.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.460]   If they need to eat, you become a chef.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.460]   If they don't behave, you become the police.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.460]   If they have problems, you become the counselor.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:32.460]   If they wear unmatching socks, you become their designer.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.460]   If they don't comb their hair right, you become the hairdresser.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:42.460]   You become whatever you need to become based upon what they need.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.460]   Why?
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   Because you love them.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   It's not about you.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:51.460]   I know plenty of ladies who refuse to cook until they have their child.
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.460]   "Oh, why? How come the women have to cook? Why don't the men cook?"
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:20:03.460]   And then they have their kid and all their feministic thing that they grew up in goes out the door because your kids.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:09.460]   And all of that, all of the secular philosophy goes out the window because you need to care for your kids.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.460]   And again, I'm not saying that this is true just of moms.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:18.460]   The description is no different from a husband.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.460]   There is no description.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   If you are a leader, if you are a pastor, there is no job that you don't come into ministry saying, "I'm going to do this," and everything else is your problem.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:31.460]   Then you're not the leader.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.460]   A leader is the one who loves as Christ loved.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:40.460]   You become all things to all men, but by all means to save some.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.460]   You can't come into ministry saying, "I'm going to do this and I'm not going to do that.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.460]   I'm going to preach, but I'm not going to take care of the toilet.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.460]   I'm going to teach, but I'm not going to work with the children."
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:55.460]   You become whatever you need to become because you love the church and you want what the church needs.
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.460]   So there is no job description.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.460]   There is no part-time pastor.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.460]   There is no part-time leader.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:09.460]   Sometimes it's not in season, so there's greater sacrifice, and sometimes there's rewards.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:15.460]   But he says Paul describes his ministry in that way.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:21.460]   He says, "Observe, consider carefully that their doctrine and their life lines up,"
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.460]   and then he says to mimic that faith, mimetus.
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.460]   In our generation, it almost seems arrogant to say, "Follow me."
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460]   What an arrogant thing to say.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.460]   "Follow me." Who are you?
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.460]   I know some people who have been burned by their previous leaders.
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:43.460]   I had a friend who was burned himself, and he said, "I follow Christ, but I follow no man."
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.460]   I understand because you've been burned.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:52.460]   I fully understand that because when I was a young man, I got converted by a church--
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.460]   not a church, a parachurch ministry in Los Angeles.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.460]   That was everything to me.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   I dropped baseball. I dropped my friends.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.460]   I dropped everything because I wanted to be in their fellowship.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:08.460]   Eventually, my parents moved from Burbank to Orange County, and I couldn't attend that ministry anymore.
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.460]   So eventually, I couldn't go.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:17.460]   I remember just being away, and I was struggling, and I couldn't get down to L.A.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460]   because I had no rides to get over there.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.460]   Then I met the pastor because they were playing volleyball or some tournament,
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.460]   and I met the pastor of that ministry.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:29.460]   I remember meeting him, and I was so excited to say hello to him
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:34.460]   because I haven't seen him in a couple of years because I couldn't go down to L.A.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:37.460]   I remember he came up to me, and he grabbed my hand.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:42.460]   I was so excited to say hello to him. He grabbed my hand, and he said, "You traitor."
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.460]   I thought he was kidding.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.460]   I looked into him. He was hurt that I wasn't coming, and he said, "You're a traitor.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.460]   You're a traitor because you stopped coming to our ministry."
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.460]   Then he just walked off.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:59.460]   I was so devastated by that because he meant everything to me.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   I got saved through his ministry, through his preaching.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.460]   I was discipled. I gave up everything to go to their Friday night prayer meetings
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.460]   and to have that man call me a traitor, it devastated me.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.460]   When the next ministry came around, the campus ministry,
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   my former disciple asked me, "Hey, do you want to be discipled?"
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.460]   I jumped at the chance. I said yes.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.460]   I remember the very first thing I said to him,
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:29.460]   "I want to be discipled by you, but I don't want to be part of your ministry.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:33.460]   I don't want to commit to this ministry because I don't want that happening again."
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.460]   It's just personal between me and you, but don't ask me to join this ministry.
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:41.460]   It took me years for me to get over that hump because I was so discouraged
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:44.460]   by that one statement, "You traitor."
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.460]   To this day, it rings in my head.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:52.460]   Today, it sounds arrogant to even say, "Follow me. You're just a man."
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.460]   Look at how often Paul says this, Hebrews 6.12,
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.460]   "So that"--this is not Paul, but in Hebrews--
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.460]   "so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who,
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.460]   in faith and patience, inherit the promises."
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:09.460]   1 Corinthians 11.1, "Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ."
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.460]   1 Corinthians 4.16-17, "Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:17.460]   For this reason I have sent you to Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord,
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.460]   and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ."
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.460]   Philippians 3.17, "Brethren, join in following my example.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.460]   Observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us."
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:30.460]   Philippians 4.9, "The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me,
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.460]   practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you."
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.460]   1 Thessalonians 4.16, "You also became imitators of us and of the Lord,
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.460]   having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit."
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.460]   2 Thessalonians 3.9, "Not because we do not have the right to do this,
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.460]   but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you,
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:50.460]   so that you would follow our example."
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.460]   It sounds--again, it sounds like, "Why? It's biblical to say,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.460]   'Hey, don't follow me. I'm a sinner just like you.'"
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:03.460]   And so we excuse all kinds of behavior, all kinds of lifestyle, in leadership,
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:07.460]   because we think it's humble. We think it's biblical.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:13.460]   And so the standard that we have in leadership is no different than the rest of the church.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:16.460]   And so because the church is growing and there's a greater need,
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.460]   we're going to pick whoever to fill that hole.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.460]   If you're old enough, if you're experienced enough, you get in that position,
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:26.460]   and then some men's sins are obvious, some men's sins trail behind them.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:30.460]   And then by fixing an immediate problem,
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:35.460]   you end up kicking a can down the road that's going to ruin the church later on.
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.460]   He says, "Do not lay hands hastily."
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:45.460]   He says, "Follow me." A leader must be able to say, "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:49.460]   Yes, we're flawed men.
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.460]   We're flawed men.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.460]   But you need to keep us at a high standard.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.460]   Test what we say.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.460]   Test the Word of God. Test the life of the leaders.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:03.460]   And if there is something that needs to be questioned,
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:06.460]   if there's two or three, if there's an agreement,
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.460]   he says, "Bring it to the church,
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.460]   because the damage will be severe if you do not."
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:16.460]   A perfect example of this is Ravi Zacharias.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:20.460]   And I know that's a sore spot to some of you because you really looked up to Ravi Zacharias.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:26.460]   Here's a man who spent 30, 40 years of ministry influencing internationally.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:31.460]   When he died, all kinds of filth came out.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.460]   It wasn't even hidden.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.460]   People knew about it.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:40.460]   He himself said, as he was sexually assaulting people,
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:45.460]   the excuse that he gave was, "Because I'm being used greatly for God,
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.460]   that God will excuse this."
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.460]   And many people bought into that and said,
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.460]   "We don't want to disturb the international community.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:57.460]   If they find out what he is like behind the scenes,
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:00.460]   all of his ministry is going to crumble."
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.460]   So they excused. This was not an indiscretion.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:08.460]   This was not just somebody who was tempted and fell for the minute.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.460]   This was a pattern in his life where his public life and private life
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.460]   was a completely different man.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.460]   And I don't think he was a Christian.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:22.460]   But yet, the church completely ignored what was obvious.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.460]   Because there were, after he died, people started coming out
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.460]   and realizing, "How did he keep this buried?"
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:31.460]   It wasn't buried. People knew about it.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.460]   Testimony after testimony after testimony started coming out.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:40.460]   And they just kept it under wraps because they didn't want to ruin his ministry.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:44.460]   But now that after he has died, all of it has surfaced,
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:49.460]   and the ministry has crumbled, and I think the impact of that is much worse today
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:52.460]   than if it had been revealed when he was alive.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.460]   We must not.
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:57.460]   He says, "Not many of you should become leaders
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:02.460]   because leaders will be under a greater scrutiny.
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:06.460]   Because when the leaders fall, so will the church."
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.460]   Now having said that, he said, "Well, thank God I'm not a leader."
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.460]   Maybe some of you guys may be thinking that.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:16.460]   But it is important for me and the leaders of our church
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.460]   to watch our doctrines and our life carefully.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:24.460]   You're all leaders, especially the men, in your own homes.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:28.460]   Your family will rise and fall based upon your leadership.
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.460]   In our community, wherever you are, as you are watching me
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.460]   and as I'm doing my best to lead you to Christ,
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.460]   there are non-Christians in your life who are looking to you to represent Christ.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.460]   And so you must also watch your life and doctrine carefully
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:46.460]   because if you do so, you will save yourself and also those who are around you.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.460]   So it is imperative.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.460]   Our doctrines matter.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.460]   How we live our life matters.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.460]   Let me say that again.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:02.460]   Your doctrines matter, and your life matters.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.460]   It has eternal consequence.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:08.460]   Anyone who tells you otherwise does not know the Word of God.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:14.460]   Let's pray.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:19.460]   Again, let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord in prayer.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:23.460]   Anything I said that disturbs you, I challenge you.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.460]   Test me. Test it with the Word of God.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:31.460]   Don't make what you hear from here to be the final authority in your life.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   Examine the Word for yourself.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.460]   Look up the verses that I gave that you didn't like.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:39.460]   See if what I'm saying is taken out of context.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:45.460]   See if I have a hobby horse that I keep pounding on that really isn't biblical.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:50.460]   Examine what you hear so that your authority doesn't come from this pulpit,
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:54.460]   from your own personal lives, but from the Word of God.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   But if you find it to be true, if you find what the Word of God says is true,
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   then we must commit ourselves to the Word,
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:06.460]   and we must commit ourselves to follow what the Word of God says.
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:10.460]   Let's take some time to pray and ask the Lord of the harvest
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.460]   to raise up more biblical leaders.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:16.460]   Harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:20.460]   So let's take some time to pray as we ask the Lord to examine us.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:24.460]   [music]
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.460]   [music]
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:32.460]   [music]
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:45.460]   [music]

[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.460]   [music]
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:28.460]   Let's all rise for the closing praise.
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:32.460]   And for those seated outside, if I could ask that everyone remain seated
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.460]   so that everyone can see the lyrics for "Praise."
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:40.460]   [music]
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:59.460]   The Lord of every age, author of our faith,
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:06.460]   first and last the same, the name above all names.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:13.460]   Crowned in majesty, glorious prince of peace,
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:20.460]   throne of God's right hand, the world at His command,
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:25.460]   the world at His command.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:33.460]   Jesus, Lamb of God, how great You are.
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:39.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:47.460]   Every knee bows down at Your renown.
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:53.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:56.460]   [music]
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:15.460]   Merciful, high priest, lover of the least,
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:22.460]   generous and meek, protector of the weak,
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:29.460]   sacrifice to death for us to find our breath.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:36.460]   You write the words to save, to overcome the grave,
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.460]   to overcome the grave.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:49.460]   Jesus, Lamb of God, how great You are.
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:55.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   Every knee bows down at Your renown.
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:08.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:12.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:15.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:19.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:33.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:39.460]   You reign forever.
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:47.460]   Jesus, Lamb of God, how great You are.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:53.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:35:01.460]   Every knee bows down at Your renown.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:06.460]   There is no other--Jesus, Lamb of God.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:15.460]   Jesus, Lamb of God, how great You are.
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:20.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:28.460]   Every knee bows down at Your renown.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:34.460]   There is no other Savior.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:37.460]   [music]
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:52.460]   [music]
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:57.460]   Heavenly Father, we pray that Your Spirit that You've given
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:01.460]   to us, Lord God, would continue to groan on our behalf.
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:04.460]   Help us, Lord, to not to grieve the Spirit,
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.460]   not to turn from Your Word to the left or to the right.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:12.460]   Help us, Lord God, to follow You and to love You,
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.460]   to honor You.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:16.460]   We pray, Father God, that the examples that have gone before
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.460]   us, men and women, Lord God, who gave their lives,
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:22.460]   that we may have Your Word to spread the gospel to the
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.460]   remotest parts of the world.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:29.460]   Help us, Lord God, to consider carefully the end result of
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:32.460]   their lives, Lord God, that we may mimic their faith,
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:37.460]   that these men and women who have so boldly stood up for the
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.460]   gospel, that we would continue that tradition in our
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:47.460]   generation, that no matter how difficult life may become,
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:50.460]   help us to have an eternal perspective.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:53.460]   Help us, Lord God, not to be short-sighted for this short
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:56.460]   period of life, Lord God, where we come and go like a mist.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.460]   Lord, I pray that You would open our eyes,
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:02.460]   that we may see eternity, that all things that we do,
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:05.460]   that we would long for, fight for,
[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:08.460]   strive for, the things that matter in eternity.
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:11.460]   So we pray that You would continue to purify our church,
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:15.460]   bring revival in our generation, that as the world becomes more
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.460]   and more wicked, that we will become brighter and brighter,
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.460]   Lord God, as light in darkness.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:24.460]   Help us, Lord God, to be salt of this earth,
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:27.460]   that Christ may be exalted, that our neighbors and our friends
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:31.460]   and our family members may know that there is hope in the name
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.460]   of Jesus Christ.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:36.460]   For that end, I pray that You would send us wherever You send
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.460]   us, that may we be the light that You have called us to be.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:41.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:50.460]   God sent His Son.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:56.460]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:07.460]   He came to love, heal, and forgive.
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:13.460]   He lived and died.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:18.460]   To buy my heart again.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:29.460]   An empty grave is there to put my Savior's lips.
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:40.460]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:46.460]   Because He lives.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:51.460]   All fear is gone.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:39:02.460]   Because I know He holds a future.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:13.460]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.460]   Amen.
