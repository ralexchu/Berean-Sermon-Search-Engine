[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 9.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.600]   I'm going to be reading from verse 14 through 18.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.720]   Romans chapter 9, verse 14 to 18.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.720]   What shall we say then?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.440]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.160]   By no means, for he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.760]   have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.520]   So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has mercy.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.120]   For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.760]   might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.040]   So then he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.840]   Let's pray.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.840]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.520]   We pray that your word will truly go forth and will not return until it has accomplished
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580]   its purpose.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.240]   We pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would guide us, convict us, and that your
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.760]   authority, your very breath and presence may be known through your word.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   Let me start out by asking you a question.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.400]   How do you come to a conclusion whether something is right or wrong?
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.040]   How do you come to that conclusion, whether something is right or wrong?
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   As you guys know, the political environment that you and I live in in the United States
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.560]   right now is extremely divided.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.560]   As far as I can remember following politics, I've never seen it this intense.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   You have half the country that believes every word that's coming out of Trump's mouth
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.760]   is a lie.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.000]   And some people are willing to hurt themselves and hurt other people who are in the opposition.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.800]   And then you have the other half of the country who believe that everything Obama said was
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.940]   a lie.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.680]   And so they're angry and in protest.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   And each group is absolutely convinced the other group is wrong.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.960]   And obviously if you're committed to one side or the other, you just think that the
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.280]   whole other group is just dummies.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.120]   You know, if they just studied more, if they were a little bit more intelligent, if they
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.400]   were more moral, you know, then they wouldn't vote like that.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.880]   Well, that's in the larger scale, you see how politics where people can be so passionate
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   about something and be completely on the opposite side.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.800]   You take it into a bigger scale, that's how wars begin.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.600]   But you have one country over another country who absolutely believes that their right and
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   the other country or other group is wrong.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   I think most people, when they get into that kind of conflict, don't say, well, you know,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.640]   I'm clearly wrong and you're clearly right, but I'm going to fight to death.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.560]   Most people who take up arms to get into conflict usually are absolutely convinced that their
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.600]   right and the other people are evil.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.720]   How do you come to conclusion?
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.760]   And if you break it down into a smaller scale, that happens between husband and wife.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   I mean, we don't get into fights because it's clear who's right and who's wrong.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.780]   It's because you have two people who are convinced that they're right.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.560]   And so if they don't find a resolution, eventually it escalates into a big fight.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.920]   That happens oftentimes in church.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.360]   You have people on one side who believe certain things and the other side who believes in
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   something else.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   And most of the time what happens is if you have strong personalities who are not willing
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   to back down and both sides are absolutely convinced that they're right and then they're
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.200]   willing to fight, a lot of times people are kind of docile.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.160]   You know, we don't want to get into conflict.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   Not because they changed their mind.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.440]   They just don't like to fight.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.040]   So every once in a while you'll like people who are used to fighting.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.000]   And then when those two people meet together and they can't come to a resolution, then
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.880]   again it turns into a bigger problem.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.640]   How do we even come to understand what is right or wrong?
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.240]   How do we determine what is just and unjust?
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.640]   Because that's a question that comes up all the time.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.080]   Whether it's in politics, in personal relationships, between marriage, even with your children
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.720]   and at church, where we feel an injustice.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.920]   That something needs to be done.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.400]   Something needs to be corrected.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.800]   Well Paul is addressing that question of the gospel.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.360]   If you've been paying attention to Paul carefully, Paul's been trying to address up to chapter
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.320]   nine after presenting a detailed message of the gospel, then how can this be fair?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.160]   If God made a promise and he made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and now you're
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   saying that not all Israelites are Israelites.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.120]   And the reason why there's these bunch of Israelites who had absolute confidence that
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.480]   if they died that they're going to be in heaven or they have a special place in God's kingdom.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.560]   And he says not all Israelites are Israelites.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.720]   In God's sovereign choice that he chose some and some were not chosen.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   So the obvious question that's going to come up is, then is God unjust?
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.680]   And that's what verse 14 begins by saying.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   What shall we say then?
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.420]   And the question is swiftly answered, by no means.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.760]   If that's what you've been thinking and that's what you've been asking, Paul says by no means.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.960]   In order to answer this question that seemingly seems like God is unjust, people respond in
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.080]   different ways.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.760]   Some people outright reject God.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.200]   And I'm sure some of you guys have friends or family members who say, I'm not going to
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.880]   go to church because God is not fair.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   Why does God allow 9/11 or famine or maybe something a little more personal, an illness
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   or death in your family?
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.840]   So, well, God doesn't seem fair.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.500]   If he really is a God of love, how could he be doing this?
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.900]   He seems unjust.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.360]   And so you have a segment of people who may have left the church and say, I'm never going
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.040]   to come back because I don't want to worship a God who is unjust like him.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.600]   Some people try to change God himself because what seems, at least on the surface, he's
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.740]   like, well, God can't be just if he sovereignly chooses.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.880]   If he truly practices predestination, he can't be just.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.800]   I remember back in seminary, I was required to attend this conference called Evangelical
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.880]   Theological Society, ETS.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.480]   And basically it's a room filled with seminary professors who have doctorates and PhDs in
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.000]   very specific subjects.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.700]   And I had no idea what they were talking about.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.780]   They were quoting Greek and Hebrew like they were speaking English.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.200]   Like it was just flowing out of them and we're just sitting there and we're just trying to
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.440]   get our credit for seminary class.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   You know, so we sat there.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   I didn't know what they were talking about, but I knew something was going on because
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.000]   it was a room filled with maybe about 1500 seminary professors.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.660]   And we have lowly seminary students who are just sitting in the back observing.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.100]   I knew something was up because there was a stir in the room.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.160]   And you could tell people are murmuring.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.000]   And this man named Dr. Pinnock, he must have been about six feet five, very tall man.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.720]   And after he presented his paper, people just started standing up in protest.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.160]   And then they say, "Well, any Q&A?"
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.720]   And I guess this is a normal practice.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.920]   After they do a presentation, the professor will stand up and basically question his thesis.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.080]   And so there's a long line that started forming on both sides of the aisle.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.040]   Probably maybe about 15, 20 deep on each side.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.960]   And each one that came up was very animated.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.520]   You know, how can you possibly say this, the significance of what you're saying.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.160]   And then I didn't fully understand what was being said.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.920]   What I found out later was that Dr. Pinnock presented a paper on 1 Peter 3, 19-20, where
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   it talks about how Jesus went after being crucified, went and proclaimed the gospel
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.480]   to those who are in prison.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.960]   So some of you guys who know that text, you know what that passage means.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.480]   So he took that and he presented this whole paper that Jesus will preach the gospel to
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.240]   people who've never heard the gospel.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.520]   Meaning that if you were, happened to be born in a country or on the jungles and you died
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.260]   without ever hearing the gospel, if God is going to be fair, he's going to have to preach
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.260]   the gospel to them.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.320]   So basically that's the paper that he was presenting based on that text.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.000]   That if God is going to be fair, they need to equally have opportunity for the gospel.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.440]   And obviously it's heresy.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.020]   That's not what the scripture teaches.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.360]   And people began to say, well, if that's the case, then why should we ever do missions?
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   You know, by not presenting the gospel to them, they're going to hear the gospel directly
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.400]   from Jesus, you know, not from me.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.840]   And so all these people were protesting.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.480]   Again, his thesis that he presented became so popular, eventually it turned into a book.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.280]   And the heresy that began to spread in the church at that time, and I think traces of
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.840]   it still now, but you don't hear about it much now, is what we call the openness of
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   God theology.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.880]   It came from Dr. Pinnock.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.800]   In his mind, he was trying to make God fair.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.840]   In his understanding of what fairness is, so he changed God.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.280]   He changed the gospel.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:19.780]   Now a lesser version of that, again, not heresy, but if we're not careful, that in our attempt
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:27.080]   to try to justify God, we say, well, if God practices predestination, then he can't be
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   just.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.720]   So therefore, God doesn't determine.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.920]   All he does is sees.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   He kind of sees what the man's going to do, and then he reacts based upon what he sees.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.960]   Again, it's a lesser version, but the part behind it, or the mind behind it is, since
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.800]   God is just, and what I see in scripture, or at least what's being presented seems
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:57.920]   unjust, they go back and reinterpret scripture and reidentify what God is doing.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.840]   Absolutely, again, incorrect and unbiblical.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.240]   Paul is going to deal with that same question.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.600]   If God sovereignly elects some, and some of these Jews and some Gentiles, they're not
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   Christians because God didn't elect them, is there injustice in God?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.640]   And the answer to that is by no means.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.280]   Of course not.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.440]   How can you possibly even entertain that God is unjust?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.480]   So what I want to do this morning is observe three observations from this text of how he
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.460]   answers this question, and hopefully that'll help us.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.580]   Whether it satisfies us or not, this is how Paul presents the answer to that question.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:43.200]   The first observation is, Paul just straight up quotes scripture.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.540]   His first line of authority in answering this question is, "Well, this is who God is."
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.680]   So if you remember last week's text, he is trying to answer the question, "Well, some
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.660]   are Israelites and some are not, even though they have the heritage, that salvation is
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.180]   not by the flesh, but by God's promise."
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.180]   And so he goes back and he searches scripture and he talks about how Isaac and Ishmael,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:13.220]   Ishmael may have been the fleshly line, but the line came through the promise of Isaac.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.020]   Same thing as Jacob and Esau.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.900]   Esau would have been as the firstborn, the fleshly line, but then the promise line came
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.300]   to Jacob.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.080]   Now he quotes again another two passages.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.140]   The first passage in Exodus 33, 19, where he just simply says, "For he says to Moses,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.360]   I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.140]   Now that may not be satisfactory to you.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.140]   You say, "Well, God has compassion on whom he has compassion?
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.140]   How can that be fair?"
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.460]   Well, here's what God said to Moses, "I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.500]   I know your first thing that you might be thinking, "That sounds like circular reasoning."
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.780]   He didn't really answer the question.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.380]   He just answered the question by repeating the question.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.380]   He just quoted scripture.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.580]   He does the same thing in verse 17.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.340]   "For the scripture says to Pharaoh, 'For this very purpose I have raised you up, that
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:12.580]   I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.'"
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:18.660]   So if you were like me, if you read this for the first time, I was not satisfied.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.060]   I'm very eager, like, "Okay, so how is Paul going to answer this question?"
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.940]   I'm looking for this deep philosophical presentation.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.500]   I say, "Oh, okay, I get it.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.500]   That's what the scripture says."
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.500]   But the first thing that Paul says is just simply quote scripture.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.280]   And it dawned on me as I was studying, you know, again, in the past when I was studying
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.440]   this passage, that Paul simply was bringing authority.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:49.740]   And he's saying to these Jews that what I am presenting to you is not new.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.120]   That the gospel that Paul is proclaiming isn't a new gospel that God all of a sudden changed
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.060]   his mind and decided to go another route.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.540]   What he is establishing here is God himself and his plan and the gospel has been deeply
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.340]   embedded in scripture.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:13.540]   That this is how God has performed his work and brought the gospel from the very beginning.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.700]   And that's what he's doing.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:23.300]   He's establishing authority of what Paul is saying by going back and quoting scripture.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:29.060]   Our authority in how we come to know what is right and wrong, it has to be from the
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.640]   Bible.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.980]   It has to be from scripture.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.460]   How do you come to the conclusion of what should be or should not be?
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.540]   Now we can say, "Well, you know, I'm very educated," or "I'm older so I have experience,"
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.340]   or "I've traveled the world so I've seen things that you haven't seen," you know, or "I come
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.020]   from a certain culture," or "I had better grades than you."
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.620]   You know, we can apply all of that.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.140]   And I'm sure in the back of our mind, even though you may not be expressing that, but
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:01.100]   some part of us, when we make argument, there's some part of us always say, "Well, I have
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.340]   more credibility than you."
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.140]   And then the other person is going to think the same thing.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.860]   "Well, but I have more credibility than you.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.980]   I'm older than you.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.980]   I live longer.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.960]   I've experienced this and I have more intellect.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.540]   My GPA was higher than you."
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.340]   And even though that may not be expressed, there's a part of us that tries to overpower
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:24.260]   the other person's argument saying, "My view of what is right and wrong is probably more
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.780]   justifiable than yours."
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.300]   And that's why the other person doesn't back down.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.660]   But where do we get our authority?
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.780]   How do we determine what is just and unjust?
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.140]   Paul simply states, "This is God."
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.940]   He doesn't run into a philosophical argument and then tries to convince them based upon
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.820]   how they understand what is right and wrong.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.740]   He just simply quotes Scripture.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.800]   "This is what God said.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.420]   What I'm saying to you, God has always said that.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.620]   This is how He's always acted."
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.740]   The question we need to ask ourselves is, do we judge God or God judge us?
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:05.420]   Do we approach God and determine whether God is fair or unfair based upon my understanding
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.020]   of fair and unfair?
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.100]   In the book of Judges, you guys who know the story in the book of Judges, you have the
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.020]   period when Israel did not have kings.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.620]   They would constantly fall into this pattern of rebelling against God.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.300]   And then God would bring judgment.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   And then when they're desperate, they would cry out to God.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.660]   God would have mercy.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.140]   And then they would be restored.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:35.500]   And when they restored, the phrase that keeps being repeated over and over again is, "Everyone
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.180]   did what they thought was right in their own eyes."
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.740]   That was the beginning of their problem.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.740]   It doesn't say everyone did whatever they wanted to do, whether right or wrong.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740]   That's not what it says.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.060]   Everyone did what they thought was right.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.300]   But by what standard?
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.980]   By their own eyes.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.740]   And that's what kept on causing them to get into trouble.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:04.260]   Everyone determined what was right by their own experience, by their own observation,
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.260]   by what they thought was right, what they thought was just, and then that kept on getting
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.220]   them into this cycle of problems.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.780]   That's why in Romans chapter 12, verse 2, it tells us not to be conformed to the pattern
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.300]   of this world, but be transformed by what?
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.420]   Renewing of your mind.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.080]   Our mind, our paradigm, how we come to conclusion of what is right and wrong has to be tested
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.700]   by God's Word.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.460]   What we deem to be right, what we deem to be wrong, the authority must first and foremost
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.020]   come from His Word.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:46.700]   Paul says to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians chapter 2, after rebuking them, saying that
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.620]   you guys are divided, this division in the church was what was causing all this chaos
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.620]   and immorality to exist within the church.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.980]   And it all started when each one said, you know, I follow Paul, I follow Peter, I follow
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   Apollos.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:07.100]   And now, their division in the church wasn't, I'm going to be an idol worshiper, or I'm
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.100]   going to be doing this.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.340]   And it wasn't that.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.240]   Each one was determining what was right and what was wrong.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.140]   And Paul says to them, aren't you acting fleshly?
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.380]   That you're not united because you're determining by your standard what you think is right.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.900]   So Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, verse 14, the natural person does not accept the things
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.020]   of the Spirit of God.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.700]   For they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.020]   discerned.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.060]   Meaning the reason why there's division among you is because you're acting natural.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.740]   You're acting fleshly.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.580]   You're allowing the paradigm of the world to dictate to you, even though it's practiced
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.700]   in the church, you can quote the name of Jesus, but what you consider to be right and wrong,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.300]   good and bad, is not coming from Scripture.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.460]   Sometimes it comes from the entertainment that we watch.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.740]   Sometimes it comes from our personal experience and some of the successes that we had.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.140]   I applied these principles in my life and I had success, so therefore the church should
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.940]   be this way.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.060]   Sometimes it's from our education.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.100]   And all of these things are trying to be applied in church, and none of these things are necessarily
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.460]   wrong or it's bad.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.420]   But there's a lot of things that God does in the Bible and in the Scripture is absolutely
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.100]   contradictory to what we know from this world.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:39.580]   He deliberately chooses men who are in utter chaos, who are weak, who are uneducated, for
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.620]   what purpose?
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.780]   To glorify himself so that the world will know that the power of the church was not
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.220]   people.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.960]   It was not the organization.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.260]   It was not the giftedness or the education.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:59.780]   It was not the money, but God by His Spirit, not by man's hard work, but when men who are
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.420]   humble, who had nothing to offer the church, God placed His Holy Spirit in them and by
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.780]   the Holy Spirit the church blew up.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.500]   Not because they were well organized, not because they had a great strategy.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.920]   The church began to grow because of persecution.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.420]   They were running, afraid of their lives.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.820]   And in the midst of that the Holy Spirit began to work in them and then they started sharing
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.340]   the gospel wherever they went.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.920]   Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit says the Lord.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.140]   Which is a complete contradiction to everything that we know of this world.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.140]   We have to get educated, we have to apply, we have to test it and then if it works then
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.100]   we apply that for the next thing and after a while we think, well, you know, I know how
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.100]   to do this.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.300]   Because I was successful in my school, I was successful at my home, I was successful in
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.580]   my business, so I know how to do this.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.040]   Where does our authority come from?
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:05.220]   Our final authority, where we move, it causes us to stop, it changes the way we think.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.380]   It must come from Scripture.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.180]   How do we determine what is right, what is fair?
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.580]   It has to come from Scripture.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.100]   We can say that the Bible is inerrant, you know, and I know very few people, at least
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.580]   in our circle, that will deny that.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.460]   At least in our circle.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.700]   But the proof of inerrancy, authority of the Word of God is how do you behave when the
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   Word of God is made clear?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.460]   Even if it doesn't seem right, when the Word of God is quoted, does that cause you to say,
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.620]   well, I see that's what it says, but it's hard for me to accept.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:52.260]   It's hard for us to accept because our final authority may not be Scripture.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.140]   The Scripture, if it is our final authority, it should cause us to stop.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   It should cause us to change our paradigm.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:05.300]   And arguments should end if the Bible can be clearly quoted to be proven to be true.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.060]   And that's exactly what Paul is doing.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.860]   Paul is simply taking the Word of God to them, saying, if what you're saying, this gospel
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.660]   that seems to contradict everything that I've known, and you're saying it's not by a heritage,
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.860]   not by my good works, isn't God unfair?
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.220]   And then he says, well, look at the Scripture that you've been reading all this time, that
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.660]   you declared to be inerrant and it's from God and has authority over your life.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.660]   Look at the Scripture.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:37.060]   It is consistent with what God has been saying and doing all this time.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.540]   Where does our authority come from?
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.180]   What causes us to repent?
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.780]   What causes us to change our mind if it is not the Word of God?
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.140]   Do we have more confidence in our intellect?
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.580]   Do we have more confidence in people?
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.460]   Do we have more confidence in what we see?
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.580]   Or is it ultimately from God's Word?
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.740]   So that's the first observation.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.540]   His authority, first and foremost, is God's inerrant word.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.860]   Second observation in his argument is that you can earn condemnation, but grace and mercy
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.740]   is only given by God.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.660]   Let me say that again.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:18.940]   You can earn condemnation, but grace and mercy is only God's to give.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   The very argument that we make, well, that sounds unjust.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:30.440]   If God chooses some and not choose others, how can that be fair?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.780]   And that's the question that he's presenting.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.580]   Now that question itself, that question itself has to be challenged.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.400]   Think about the perspective.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.700]   How many of us think about people who've donated millions and billions of dollars?
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:56.200]   And I read recently that the founder of, I think, Facebook donated like a billion dollars
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.780]   or something for trying to get good water into people who don't have access to water.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.780]   Right?
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.220]   A billion dollars, I forgot how much it was, but it was a ridiculous amount of money.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:14.100]   And how many people responded to that by saying, "Well, Mark Zuckerberg is so unjust."
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.540]   Right?
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.660]   Why is that?
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:23.660]   Because he donated all that money to get water, but he didn't donate the money for food.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.880]   What about all the starving people?
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.640]   What about cancer research?
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.960]   What about homeless people?
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.560]   What about all the different diseases?
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:40.600]   So how can Mark Zuckerberg be fair if he only donated money for clean water?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:48.200]   See, the very question itself, questioning God's justice because he elected to choose
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.360]   some and not others, how can that be fair?
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:59.320]   See the very question that we ask in and of itself reveals our own hearts.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:05.040]   So we come and we examine God not realizing what it is that we are seeing.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.060]   So that's why he says in verse 15, "For Moses says, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.860]   and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'"
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:20.160]   This is a direct quote from Exodus chapter 33, 19, where Moses pleads with God that if
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:26.080]   you really want me to lead these people out in the desert, show me your glory.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   And he's begging him.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.680]   He can't, if they don't know that you are with me, if they don't know that you are with
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.920]   us, then we're going to be vulnerable.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.040]   There's no way that we're going to make it.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.840]   So Moses is pleading, let me see your glory.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.520]   Let Israelites know that you are with us.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:46.000]   And in response to his begging, God says, "I will have compassion on whom I have compassion
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.640]   and I will have mercy on whom I have mercy."
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.160]   In other words, he was responding to Moses saying, "Tell them that I will be merciful
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.640]   to you by showing my grace.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.120]   Tell them that I will answer your prayer, that I will be merciful and I will show myself
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   to you."
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.440]   See, we're questioning the grace of God.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.880]   At least that's what the Israelites were saying.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.200]   In Psalm 51 verse 1, when David was pleading and crying out to God, "Have mercy on me,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.560]   O God, according to your steadfast love.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.160]   Have mercy on me."
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:27.360]   Notice how when we repent, we never repent by saying, "Lord, be just with me."
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.040]   We would never pray that prayer as a sinner.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.640]   A sinner would never pray that prayer, "Lord, be just with me."
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.520]   Because the moment that he is just with a sinner, we would disintegrate.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.840]   All that would be fair would be judgment.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.720]   So a sinner will never pray before God, "Lord, be just with me."
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:54.240]   The only prayer that a sinner can pray before a holy God is, "Lord, be merciful to me.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.680]   Don't give me what I deserve.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.280]   Be merciful.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.480]   Be merciful according to your steadfast love, according to your abundant mercy.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   Blot out my transgression.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.680]   Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin."
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.640]   In fact, at the temple, at the Holy of Holies, the most holiest article was the Ark of the
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.760]   Covenant.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.800]   And on this Ark of the Covenant, there was a seat where symbolically, God himself or
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.320]   the Messiah would come and take his seat.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.840]   You know what that seat was called?
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.320]   It was called the Mercy Seat.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:38.220]   The very throne of Christ on this earth is called the Mercy Seat.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.440]   And that seat was reserved for King, Priest, Jesus Christ and Him alone.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.080]   So every single day, every single year, when the High Priest went in and he sprinkled the
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   blood on the Mercy Seat, it was preparation for the coming of the Messiah that this King,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:59.120]   this Lord, that this God would come and take his seat by the sprinkling of the blood of
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.000]   the Lamb.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.480]   So his very presence among sinners was to remind us that it is because of his mercy
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.880]   that God is able to dwell among us.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:18.400]   That word mercy in the Greek, mentioned in Hebrews 9, 5, is the Greek word, "hilestarion,"
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.280]   and it basically means to propitiate or to expiate.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.720]   To put it simply, it means to gain or regain the favor or goodwill.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.800]   And that Mercy Seat symbolized that God's merciful presence is on earth through the
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.840]   blood of Christ, and he expiated and he propitiated our sins.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.120]   Our God is a compassionate God.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.800]   To dare question his compassion as sinners, looking up to God and saying, "God, you're
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.200]   unfair because you chose some and didn't choose others."
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.120]   Psalm 103, 13, it says, "The Father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.200]   compassion to those who fear him, for he knows our frame.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.600]   He remembers that we are dust."
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.200]   The mystery of the gospel isn't that he chooses some and not choose others.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.920]   The mystery of the gospel is he chose some.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   That's the mystery.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.260]   I mean, think about it, just logically, humanly speaking.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.480]   Why does he owe us anything?
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.760]   We've been coddled since we were little.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.040]   They think, "You're so precious.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   You're so valuable.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   You're worth everything."
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.120]   Especially our generation now.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.680]   You know, you got trophies for things that you didn't earn, and you can be in last place,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.920]   and you come out like a winner.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.600]   We don't want anybody's ego to be hurt, and you have a generation filled with people.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.920]   And I don't think it's just this generation.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:51.400]   I think all of us, even myself included, that our self-esteem is the greatest thing that
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.120]   we need to protect.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:00.240]   And so we've been raised to think like we have so much value, and so God owes us.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:08.200]   And we worship him until something about him doesn't make sense, until something happens
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.860]   in our life that we can't explain.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.360]   And then we eat automatically question, "Is God fair?
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   Is he just?
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.160]   Why does he allow these things to happen?"
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:25.240]   When, you know, I think many of you know that I'm a middle child of three sons.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.500]   And I'm a, whatever you read about middle children, that's me.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.960]   This is what a characteristic of a middle child, that's me.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.700]   That was me when I was growing up.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.000]   Life was unfair.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.720]   I was always the one neglected.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.040]   Nobody cares.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.760]   You know, I'm alone in this world.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.380]   And I had all of these symptoms when I was growing up.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.400]   And I remember one particular instance back in college, and this is after I was a Christian.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.560]   You know, my parents, you know, we grew up as a pastor's family, so we didn't have much
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   money.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   So I worked my tail off.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.300]   And the first car that I purchased, I cleaned toilets for nine, 10 months.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.260]   And so I saved up about $1,500, and I got my first car.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.820]   And I was so proud of that car.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.940]   You know, it was a piece of junk, you know.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.700]   I couldn't, my parking brake didn't work.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.580]   And I had no money to fix it, so whatever broke, just broke.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.820]   My windshield wiper broke, so I used to manually wipe the, you know, the rain down.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.500]   And then, I mean, I just, I've explained this before, so I'm not going to go in again.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.820]   It was a piece of junk.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.980]   But I was very proud of it.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.100]   You know, I washed it.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.840]   I even waxed it and tinted it.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.540]   So it was the best piece of junk on the road, right.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:39.580]   One day, my mom decides that she's going to buy my younger brother, Philip, a car.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.260]   So she is going to go buy a car, and it was a Honda Acura.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.140]   I forgot what year it was, but it was white, and it was brand new.
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.580]   And so, you know, I was a Christian, right.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.100]   I'm not into, I'm not into this material stuff, you know.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.340]   So I didn't say anything, and she wanted to buy him a car, and she was thinking about
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.780]   all this, and then she explained why she was getting him this car.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.340]   So I didn't say anything.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.060]   And I'm, you know, a middle child.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.580]   I'm hearing all this stuff, and it's like, okay, you know, Jesus is my everything, you
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.580]   know.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:16.500]   I'm driving this car, and so my mom, my mom explained to me why she wanted to get him
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.500]   a new car.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.900]   You know, Paul had a new car, and, you know, and then she said something to the effect,
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:29.020]   you know, about me, and then, but Philip never experienced having a new car.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:38.700]   So I'm driving this car, and in my mind, I'm thinking, I didn't have a new car.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.780]   And then, so I explained to my mom, I said, I never had a new car, and she said, what
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.780]   are you talking about?
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.460]   And she genuinely was dumbfounded.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.460]   Think about it.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.460]   When did I have a new car?
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.620]   You know, I'm upset, but I'm trying to be Christian at the same time.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.180]   You know, when did I have a new car?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.540]   And she's like, and she started thinking back about the cars that I drove.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.020]   It's like, oh, shoot, he never had a new car.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.780]   And then, you know, I didn't say anything.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:12.820]   You know, I just, then I went home, and then I told that story for the next 20 years.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.500]   How unjust my life has been.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.500]   Look at that.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:23.300]   Everything that I was thinking was proven at that moment, right?
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   It's so unfair.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.860]   Life was so unfair, right?
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.220]   And then, you get older.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.660]   You have your own kids, and you start to see your parents as human beings, not just as
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.660]   parents.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.060]   When you're younger, you kind of see them in a different light.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.280]   You judge them in a different light, right?
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.100]   Your friends could do certain things, and you're wowed by it.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.080]   If your parents do it, it's kind of like, eh, it's expected.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.940]   You're supposed to do that, right?
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.500]   Years later, just look, again, having my own kids and raising my own children, and you
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.740]   can see how you can easily make mistakes.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.820]   And it's not because you favor one over the other.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.180]   It's just you have a lot of kids.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.460]   You know, sometimes you forget, and sometimes you don't.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.300]   You know, you're able to do these things.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:10.680]   Then I started thinking as human beings, I don't know anybody in my life, you know, outside
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:19.660]   of meeting my wife, that has poured and sacrificed into me more than my mom.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.660]   I don't know anybody.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:28.740]   I mean, obviously, I've been married to Esther for 25 years now, right?
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.580]   And I can say that about my wife, but, you know, when I was younger, I started thinking
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:38.800]   to myself, I don't know anybody who's given to me and sacrificed for me like my mom.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.080]   And yet, all I can think about was that car.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.560]   Why I couldn't get the new car, you know?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.880]   And that's the story I'm telling everybody.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.120]   How I was neglected.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   How I was mistreated.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.560]   How I wasn't valuable in this home.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.240]   See, the people who invest the most in our lives, we just kind of automatically, oh,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.640]   of course, you're supposed to do that.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.320]   That's your job.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.760]   How often do we not understand the grace of God because we assume, you know, you're God
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.320]   though?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   How often do we hurt Him?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   How often?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.680]   You know why we say He's compassionate?
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:30.040]   Even when we talk about God's compassion, His compassion and His mercy is about us.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.400]   Oh, He's compassionate toward me.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.600]   But He has these emotions because God is an emotional God.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.320]   He's a zealous God.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.680]   He grieves.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.080]   He hurts.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:51.200]   The emotions that you feel, He has them because He created us.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:57.940]   The passion and love that you feel, He has them.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.040]   We don't think of Him as a being.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.840]   We think of Him as an it.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   And that's why even though He sent His only begotten Son, His most precious gift, and
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:17.880]   we're saved knowing that you and I don't deserve even a thought of our name on His
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   lips when something doesn't go right.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.960]   And it's not exactly the way we want it.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.400]   We step back and say, "Is He fair?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.880]   Does He really love me because He doesn't love me the way I want to be loved?"
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.500]   Because we don't see Him as a being.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.080]   We see Him as an it, a force, a thing.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.480]   But the fact that He even has compassion, that's the mystery.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   Who are we?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.980]   What is man that He is so mindful of us?
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.820]   Why is He even compassionate?
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.960]   Why is He even merciful?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.800]   I don't know.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.640]   I don't ever look at an ant in my house and have compassion.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.080]   I don't look at, I mean, I'm afraid that a little tiny mouse is going to enter my house
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.960]   and I'll do everything in my power to keep them out of the house and destroy them if
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.640]   they even come close.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Never in my mind did I ever think to have compassion or mercy.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.320]   God demonstrates His own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, while we were
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:32.960]   rebellious, while we were blasphemous, He loved us.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   In Matthew 9, 36, Jesus sees a crowd and He knows who these crowds are.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.120]   These are not good people who just got lost.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:52.200]   These are not people who were moral.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.920]   These crowds were like everybody else in this world.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.560]   They chose to worship the creation rather than the Creator.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:05.600]   And the reason why they are harassed and helpless is because they continued in their sins.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.200]   And yet He looked upon these sinners and He said He had compassion on them because they
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.760]   were harassed and helpless.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.180]   He didn't say He was annoyed with them, He was angered with them.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.480]   He had compassion for them.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.920]   The word compassion in the Greek is a very strong word.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   It's not just a light feeling.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.480]   The best way to describe it is someone being punched in the gut.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.360]   This overwhelming response of emotion.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.480]   It's like punching in the gut.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.280]   I don't know if you've ever been punched in the gut.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.700]   If you ever get punched in the gut, I mean you can't concentrate, you can't think.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.160]   You know, you ever watch a boxing match and somebody gets a good punch right in the stomach
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.080]   and they didn't get knocked out but they hunch over because they got punched in the gut.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.440]   That's the word for compassion.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.920]   Jesus saw them and He was compelled and He turned to His disciples to beseech the Lord
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   of the host.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.240]   To send out more workers.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.680]   And in Luke chapter 15 verse 20, Jesus gives a parable of the prodigal son and the son
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:12.120]   who wasted a large portion of his possessions simply to go out and have fun.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.160]   And when he asked his father, "Give me my possession now," basically he was saying,
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.440]   "I can't wait for you to die.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.040]   I want my portion now."
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.760]   He goes off and he squanders all of it.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.860]   And when he finally comes to his senses and he comes to his father's place, you would
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:31.560]   think the father would be, "Wow, that guy wasted all that and he's going to just crawl
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.520]   back now?
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.560]   He's going to think that he's going to come back in and step right back in where he was?"
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.600]   You would think that that would be the normal response.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:48.240]   The older brother, we say our older brother was a Pharisee and he was so legalistic.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.120]   We condemned the older brother.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.480]   But give me a break.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:58.560]   How many of us could relate more with the older brother?
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.080]   I think the older brother was being generous for even allowing him to come.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.580]   I mean, that's natural human response.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.520]   This guy, after everything he did, he's going to crawl back?
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.480]   And then the response of the father that Jesus says, he said, "And he rose and came to his
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:22.840]   father but while he was still long off, his father saw him and felt compassion and ran
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.000]   and embraced him and kissed him."
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   The older brother was the older brother because he doesn't realize that he's also the prodigal
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   son.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.320]   He's also the prodigal son.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.520]   He just didn't physically leave.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:48.720]   Every single one of us, every single one of us, we are here because God saw sinners and
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.440]   had compassion.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.500]   I don't understand why he had compassion on us.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.360]   I don't understand his patience.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   I don't.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   It's hard to be patient when somebody cuts me off the road for no reason and slanders
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   or whatever.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:10.440]   It's hard to be patient even for one incident and yet God sees repeated sinners and he has
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.880]   compassion.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.500]   Isn't that the greatest mystery?
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:24.360]   The greatest injustice that you and I have ever heard of isn't God passing over some
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.800]   and then saving some.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.840]   It's why he didn't pass over everybody.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:37.920]   The only injustice that has ever happened in this world was on the cross.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.160]   Every other person was a sinner deserving of punishment.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.320]   That was the second observation.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.360]   One, the authority comes from Scripture.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.760]   Second, we can earn condemnation but grace is only God's to give.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.200]   Third and finally, God hardened those who has hardened their own hearts.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.840]   That quote in verse 17 where he says, "For this very purpose I have raised you up that
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.280]   I might show my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.640]   Is a direct quote from Exodus chapter 9 verse 16 and 17.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.280]   That verse 16, let me read you that quote.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.160]   "But for this purpose I have raised you up to show you my power so that my name might
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.560]   be proclaimed in all the earth."
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.260]   And that's where the quote stops.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:24.200]   But verse 17 goes on and it says, "You are still exalting yourself against my people
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.080]   and will not let them go."
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.240]   Repeatedly over and over again, it is stated that God hardened Pharaoh's heart.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.240]   God hardened Pharaoh's heart.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.400]   But every time we see that phrase being stated, there's also a statement that Pharaoh hardened
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.800]   his own heart.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.720]   Let me read to you what Dr. Leon Morris, who's the author of the pillar commentary on the
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.760]   book of Romans and how he addresses this issue.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:54.640]   He says, "Neither here nor anywhere else is God set to harden anyone who had not first
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.520]   hardened himself.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.240]   That Pharaoh hardened his heart against God and refused to humble himself is made plain
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.400]   in the story.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:08.320]   So God's hardening of him was a judicial act, abandoning him to his own stubbornness, much
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:16.120]   as God's wrath against the ungodly is expressed by giving them over to their own depravity."
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.720]   He didn't take a man who was worshiping God and say, "You know, I had enough of this,"
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   and harden his heart.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.680]   He took a man who was already rebelling, who was already sinning against him and allowed
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.120]   him to continue to go down his path.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.640]   That's exactly what is stated in Romans chapter 1.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   That even though that God's invisible qualities was made plain and he left his imprint that
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.200]   no one would be without excuse, but man chose to worship and honor the creation rather than
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.720]   the creator.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:54.640]   In Romans 1.24.26.28, God's judgment upon mankind is expressed this way, "Therefore,
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.100]   God gave them up in the lust of their hearts to impurity, to the discerning of their bodies
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.100]   among themselves."
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.760]   For this reason, God gave them up to their dishonorable passions.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.360]   And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to be debased mind to
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.880]   do what ought not to be done.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.560]   Over and over again, God's judgment upon the world is to let them go.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.080]   You want to keep going down that path?
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.480]   You want to keep resisting, keep blaspheming?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.000]   He says he gave them over to their lust.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.880]   In other words, he withheld his mercy.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.120]   He withheld his compassion.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:43.600]   In Isaiah chapter 6, 8-11, there's a passage where Isaiah is called for ministry.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.880]   He sees a vision of God where the creatures are surrounding the throne, they're calling
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.560]   Isaiah falls down to the ground.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.760]   They come, the creatures come and touch his mouth with a coal and he opens his mouth,
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.680]   he's cleansed.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.480]   And then God says, "Who will go for me?"
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.040]   And that's a famous passage where Isaiah says, "Here am I, Lord, send me."
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.480]   But look what God sends him to do.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.080]   I'm going to start reading Isaiah 6, verse 8.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.000]   "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send and who will go for us?'
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.560]   Then I said, 'Here am I, send me.'
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.540]   And God said, 'Go and say to this people, "Keep on hearing, but do not understand.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.040]   Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.720]   Make the heart of this people dull and their ears heavy and blind their eyes, lest they
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.720]   see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.560]   and be healed.'"
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:46.520]   I think there's a good reason why God explained the specifics of his calling after he says,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.480]   "Here am I, send me."
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.920]   If God said, "Who's going to go for me to these hardened people that you're going to
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.560]   say these things and no one's going to listen to you?"
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.880]   He made sure that their hearts get hardened and their eyes become dull and they don't
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.880]   hear.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.880]   Who's going to go?
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   And who would volunteer for that?
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   I think everybody who wants to go into full-time ministry has in their mind at least hoping
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.000]   that they would have Apostle Paul's ministry.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.920]   Even if it leads to death, that's a glorious way to live.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.640]   That's a glorious way to die.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.280]   But who would want Isaiah's ministry?
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.800]   Who would want Jeremiah, the weeping prophet, all his life he's weeping with them.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.480]   And then at the end of the day, the people that he's warning, all they're saying, "That
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.800]   guy's a false prophet.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.760]   Nothing good comes out of his mouth.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.740]   Every time he opens his mouth, we're discouraged.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.240]   That guy's not from God and the false prophets come and completely contradict him.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.880]   And the false prophets are the ones that they follow, but this man who was sent by God,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.480]   who would want to volunteer to be Jeremiah or Isaiah?"
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.600]   But you know what's interesting here is that if you look at verse 10, the commandment that
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.400]   he gives Isaiah is, "Make the heart of these people dull."
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.040]   What power does Isaiah have to harden their heart?
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:12.880]   Did God give him special powers to walk around and say, "Harden your heart."
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   Can you hear what I say?
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   A little bit?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.720]   Boom, no more.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.760]   Did God give him some sort of special spiritual power to go around hardening people's heart?
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.480]   Because he says, "Make the heart of my people dull and their ears heavy and blind their
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.080]   eyes that they see with their eyes."
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.080]   Did he have some spiritual gifts to harden their hearts and close their eyes?
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.600]   What was he called to do?
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.960]   He was called to preach the word.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.320]   He was called to warn the nation of Israel about judgment coming.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:51.000]   So the way that their hearts were going to be hardened was when the word goes out and
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.280]   they resist in repentance, their hearts become harder.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.480]   They have a harder time seeing.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.400]   They have a harder time listening.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:08.980]   We don't recognize that God's mercy and grace is by his timing and is by his offering.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.880]   And that's why in Hebrews 3.13 it says, "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.720]   today."
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.920]   Of course today is always today.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.760]   What does he mean by that?
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.040]   Meaning now.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.760]   Now.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.120]   If you hear his word, if you harden your heart, tomorrow it will not be the same.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   It could be harder.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.840]   If God calls you to obey and you say, most people won't say, "I'm not going to obey."
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.680]   We usually say, "Not today.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.940]   Maybe tomorrow.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.580]   Maybe when I'm a little bit older.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.360]   Maybe when I purchase a house.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.020]   Maybe when my kid's a little bit older.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.020]   Maybe when I get married.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.460]   Maybe when I get another job.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.320]   Maybe when I have more time."
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.360]   And we delay.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.400]   We don't disobey.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.160]   We just delay the obedience.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:07.220]   Not realizing that delay is causing our hearts to become hardened.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.800]   And then when we think that we're ready, when we think that we have time, we're no longer
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   here.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.000]   We're no longer affected.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.320]   The same word of God that brought tears to your eyes no longer has any effect in your
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   life.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.440]   The same sun that hardens the clay melts the ice.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:36.840]   If we refuse his mercy and his compassion because we think something is better, we don't
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:41.720]   realize each and every single day attending a church where the word of God is opened and
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:48.220]   every time you choose to say, "Not today," that the word of God has less and less and
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.720]   less effect on you.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.920]   See, God is just.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.200]   He is merciful and he's compassionate.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.680]   He sent his word, his only begotten son, to invite us to himself.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.000]   He said, "Come to me all who are weary and heavy-laden.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.320]   I will give you rest.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.640]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   find rest for your souls."
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.880]   Where are you running for rest?
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.080]   Where are you running for rest?
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.520]   I want to challenge and encourage you this morning as we think about his mercy and his
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   compassion.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.000]   And maybe you haven't thought long enough or hard enough or maybe it's been a while
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.820]   when you really thought about it and maybe just on Sunday and then you click it off on
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.600]   Monday through Saturday and then you're reminded again on Sunday.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:50.680]   At some point in your life, you recognize that you are desperately in need of Christ
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.200]   and you came to him.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.740]   But in that journey, you got entangled with life.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:03.600]   You got married, got a job, had kids and you're just busy.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.980]   You don't have time for God.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.240]   You haven't pushed him away.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.940]   You haven't denied him but you just don't have time.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:17.960]   And as a result of that, you've been feeling this rising burden in your heart that something
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   is not right.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.240]   I mean, you've been trying to fix it by being more disciplined.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.040]   You've been trying to fix it by meeting up with more people.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:33.500]   But at the core of your heart, you know because you saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:41.160]   and you know that there is no answer for that turmoil in your heart than God's mercy and
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.520]   his compassion.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:47.760]   I want to encourage you this morning.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:53.220]   I know you're at church and I know we're singing songs and I know most of you attend Bible
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:00.100]   study but you haven't been seeking the Lord.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.940]   You've been coming to church but you haven't been seeking the Lord.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:10.360]   You put in your time and check off the Bible but you haven't been seeking the Lord.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.720]   Our God is compassionate.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.220]   He's merciful.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.360]   He's calling sinners to himself.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.140]   And I pray with all my heart and this is something that I have to tell myself every single day.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.540]   I need Jesus.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.040]   The same Jesus I met years and years ago.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.780]   I need him today.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.380]   You need him today.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:41.300]   I pray that you would be reminded of a compassionate and merciful God who draws sinners to himself
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.380]   by his gentleness.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.180]   That you would hear his voice and that you would follow.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.700]   Would you pray with me?
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.300]   Pray with me.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   What have you been running to?
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.420]   Where have you put your hope?
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.380]   Is it something else?
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:08.360]   Is it someone else?
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:13.860]   Come to Jesus.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.460]   Come to Jesus.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.220]   Cry out to Jesus.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.700]   Just like the first time you met him.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:29.940]   When you were desperate and you had no hope.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.220]   When you clung to Jesus.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.220]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:41.140]   Put all the distraction aside.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.380]   Confess like a child.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.980]   I need you.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:52.500]   Let's take some time to pray as we meditate and think and cry out to our Lord.
