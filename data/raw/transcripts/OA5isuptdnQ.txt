[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   >> Good morning, green community church.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   I have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   First of all, we want to say happy birthday to our
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   kids who are worshiping with their parents.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   Cadence Cho is celebrating the birthday.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.440]   And then Curtis Lee is turning 10.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   And Amy Lou is turning 15.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   Eloise Park is turning 3.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   Jude Park is turning 2.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   Audrey is turning 13.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   And Hannah is turning 5.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   So happy birthday to all of you.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   And so we want to give you some highlights of the
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   announcements before we get started.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   Praise and prayer, not this coming Friday but the
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.440]   Friday after on August 14th we have praise and prayer
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   at 730.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   It's going to be outside.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   So hopefully it won't be as hot.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   But again at 730 and two Fridays we're having it.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   So our weekday Bible study for the Thessalonians have
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   concluded at least for the smaller groups.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   And then the Thessalonians study -- sorry, Ephesians
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   study.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   But the first Thessalonians is going to be starting on
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   the first week of September.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   So we need you guys to sign up as soon as you can so
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   we can divide you up into small groups and home groups
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   as soon as possible.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   And then we're going to have the first Thessalonians
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.440]   beginning September.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   So I just want you guys, if you want to be a little bit
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   studious, just get ahead of the game and read first
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Thessalonians as often as you can and outline it so
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   when we jump in you'll know, you'll kind of have a
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   head start on that.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   So that's going to be on first Thessalonians.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   And today after our praise time, our brother Sam Cho is
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   going to be baptized.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   So he's going to be coming up and giving his testimony
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   after the worship time.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   So for those of you who are at home, again, for those
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   of you who are here, after I pray, we'll give you some
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   time to give the offering electronically.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   If you wanted to give it physically, it's also in the
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   back corner.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   You can just drop off your check there as well.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   Let's pray.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   Gracious and loving father, we thank you for your
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   goodness.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   We thank you, father God, for being patient with us.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   We thank you for your living word that teaches us and
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   guides us.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.440]   And even the depth of understanding of what it is
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   that you have done.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   The more we understand, the more we see your glory, the
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   more we desire to worship you.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   Lord, you truly are deserving.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   I pray, father God, that our worship may be pleasing in
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   your sight.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   That even in our giving, help us to give it to you
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   generously with our hearts filled with joy.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   That it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   Amen.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   [Music]
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   [Music]
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   [Music]
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   (light piano music)
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:28.080]   Let's all rise together as we sing
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.120]   just to go through just again,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.800]   this song is a hymn, "The Solid Rock."
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.400]   As we think about and then reminded
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.960]   about being anchored in Christ,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.240]   this song is very appropriate.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.440]   And if you do have your phone,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.800]   the lyrics are on the app.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.760]   So if you guys can pull that out and follow along.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.200]   I'm gonna read the verse one chorus.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.240]   It says, "My hope is built on nothing less
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.080]   than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.440]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.920]   but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   And on Christ, the solid rock, I stand.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   All of the ground is sinking sand.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.080]   All of the ground is sinking sand.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.760]   That we, I pray and hope that we sing these lyrics
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.280]   with understanding that Christ is who we anchor to
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   'cause we're standing on solid ground.

[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   >> Good morning church family.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   My name is Sam.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   I'm part of the family ministry.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   This is my wife.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   You can commonly see her rocking out on the keyboard.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.920]   I have two daughters.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   Carol and Cadence who are four and Cadence just turned two.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.920]   I'm here and excited to share my brief testimony about how I'm
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   being here baptized today.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   I was born into a loving Christian home and just simply
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   thought being a good kid was enough.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   Everything was good until my junior year of high school when
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   my sister Diane went off to college and life became a bit
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   more lonely and depressing.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   One weekend Diane came home to visit and she simply asked me do
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   you think you know Christ?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   If you look at Diane she's crying already.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   I answered with a no and she proceeded to share the gospel
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   with me.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   This is the moment where I can truly say to myself I started
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   seeking after the Lord.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   During this time the Lord continually revealed my sins
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   such as selfishness, lust and pride and that my circumstances
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   was caused because of my total depravity.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   I recognize that my wages of sin is death but the free gift of
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   I also realized that I needed to make Christ my Lord and I
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   wanted to pursue to be obedient to him.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   Around late high school I accepted Christ as Lord over my
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   life.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   Life as a believer has been different with each life stage.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   In my early college years my sins were very clear.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   It was constant struggles with lust and girls.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   It was a struggle with career and money.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   Now in my early 30s my sins are more subtle and harder to
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   pinpoint.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   A recent sin I have been wrestling with is making my kids
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   a top priority.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   It's been a huge struggle as a father to give what I think is
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   best for my kids as opposed to discovering God's will and
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   prayerfully deciding.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   I have decided to make Christ my Lord and life is not about me
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.920]   or my kids but more so about how can I die to myself each and
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   every day.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   God's word in Galatians says I have been crucified with Christ
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   and it's not I who lives but Christ lives in me.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   The life I live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   I was infant baptized and confirmed in college through the
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Presbyterian church and after my own personal studies on
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   baptism and rejecting the idea of infant baptism I thought to
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   myself what is the point of getting baptized now?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   After navigating through my own heart the answer is simple.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   It's because Christ is my Lord and I want to be obedient to
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   him.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   I want to be obedient to him and get baptized as I possibly
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   can.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   I want to be obedient in every possible way I can and this
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   means getting baptized, not confirmed.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   I am here with my shortcomings as a sinner and through this
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   baptism I will be uniting with Christ in his death and resurrection
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   which by confirmation I was not able to do.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   For that I am excited for this moment.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   I am excited to navigate through life being sanctified and
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   surrendering all to him.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   Today marks my baptism and my daughter's second birthday.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   I am excited to be baptized by Pastor Peter who has shepherded
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   me and yesterday I found out that James is going to be part
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   of it as well.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   I joke about letting James marry my sister but in all
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   seriousness, James has been a huge mentor, a brother that
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   helped me grow in so many ways.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   Not just me but I know so many other brothers feel the same
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.920]   way.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   For that I am excited and I thank everyone for this time.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   [Applause]
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   >> You understand when you go into the water you are
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   uniting with Christ in his death and when you come out you are
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   uniting with his resurrected life.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.920]   I am excited to be baptized by Pastor Peter.

[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   >> You don't have enough to buy groceries to feed your kids.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   The debt that is so thick, there is no way to get out of it
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.920]   other than to entertain what is bankruptcy.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.920]   How do I get out of this?
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.920]   You see, the law came to reveal, to bring us to the point,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   to bring us to repentance so we don't come before God and say
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   I did bad but I will do better the second time.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   If you give me another chance, I will get it right the second
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.920]   time.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   That's not repentance.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   True repentance is coming before God and recognizing the debt is
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   too big.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   There is just no way.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   That's why in Luke 18 when Jesus describes true repentance,
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   he first describes a Pharisee who completely missed the mark.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   A Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   God, I thank you that I am not like other people.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   You see where his pride comes from?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.920]   He wasn't looking at God.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   He was looking at other people.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   And that's where pride comes from.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   Typically when they compare their sins with other people,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   they say I am not like those other people, swindlers,
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   adulterers, tax collectors.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   I fast twice a week and pay tithe of all that I get.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   Sometimes the people who are the most faithful at church are the
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   hardest people to get to with the gospel.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   Because they have allowed their self-righteousness to be their
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   righteousness subconsciously.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   And as a result of that, the gospel doesn't penetrate.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   They are never humbled.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.920]   They are always frustrated with the sins of other people.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   But the tax collector in verse 13 says standing some distance
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   away was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven but was
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   beating his breast saying God be merciful to me the sinner.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   Now humanly speaking, the Pharisee was a good man.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   Humanly speaking.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   He was getting tithes.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.920]   He was praying.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   He was making disciples.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   He was trying hard to obey God's law.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   This tax collector was cheating his people.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   He was making other people's lives difficult.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   He did this superficially and said the tax collector was the
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   one justified before God and the Pharisee was the bad guy.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   You Pharisee.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   That's one of the worst things you can call a Christian.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   You Pharisee.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   Think of it from a human perspective.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   He is the upright moral man who is concerned about his brothers.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   And he is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   He is the one sharing about the kingdom of God.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   You have to recognize that all of those sins that you committed
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   of the previous generation, all of your forefathers, all of the
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   kings, all of the warnings of the prophets, that you are under
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   that condemnation.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   When Paul says in the book of Romans, the wrath of God is
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   being revealed against all unrighteousness, he is talking
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   about you.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   He is talking first and foremost about the Jews.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   You were guilty of a life sentence and you were sentenced
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   to die in prison and somebody came along and said, you know
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.920]   what, I took your place.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   You are free to go.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   That in and of itself, you would think that person would live
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   outside in freedom even if he struggles financially.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   Even if he is out on the street, that he would live the rest of
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   his life always thinking about the guy who took my place.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   Always thankful.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   Always grateful for what he has done.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   The gospel doesn't stop there.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   He says he not only died to forgive the sins of those people
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   in the old testament, old covenant, he says number two,
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.920]   Jesus died to give those redeemed the promised eternal
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   inheritance.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   Again, it's like I am in truth.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   I know you understand it here but let that sink in.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   He didn't just give them freedom.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   He said he gave his inheritance.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.920]   Look what he said in verse 15b.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   Those who have been called may receive the promise of eternal
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   inheritance.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   The promise of eternal inheritance.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   He didn't just release them from the obligation of the penalty
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.920]   of sin.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   He elevated them and kept his promise of inheritance.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   What is his inheritance promise?
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   Genesis 12.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   Now the Lord said to Abram, go forth from your country and
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   from your father's house to the land which I will show you and I
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   will make you a great nation and I will bless you and I will make
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   your name great.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   You shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   and the one who curses you I will curse and in you all the
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   families of the earth will be blessed.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   He made a unilateral covenant with the nation of Israel and he
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   doesn't say if you do this, I will do this.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   He says I will do this.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Keep that in mind.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   You need to keep that in mind to understand what he is saying in
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   verse 16.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   Look at verse 16.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   Again, if you are not thinking critically and you are already
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   half asleep, might as well keep sleeping because this part
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   requires your attention.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   Verse 16.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   of the one who made it.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.920]   Think about that.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.920]   What does that mean?
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   The one who made the covenant has to die in order for the
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   covenant to be effective.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.920]   What covenant do you know where that is the place?
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   What does he mean by that?
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   Who needs to die?
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   For a covenant is valid only when men are dead.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.920]   Covenant is only good when we are living.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.920]   When we die the covenant is gone.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   If the husband and wife -- even in the marriage covenant if the
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   husband and wife are dead, the covenant is only good if the
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   other dies.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   Do you read that?
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   If you are not confused, you haven't been paying attention.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.920]   You should be confused.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   You feel like I don't get this.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.920]   Then you are paying attention.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   Those of you sitting there thinking that makes perfect
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   sense, you need to wake up.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   You are not following.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   If you are paying attention, what does that mean?
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   The covenant is only good when men are dead.
