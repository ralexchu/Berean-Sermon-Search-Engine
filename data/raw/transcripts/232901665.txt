[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   Well, as we take a look at our passage, again Luke chapter 13, verses 1 through 9.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:30.640]   Let me read the passage for us as we begin today's look into the Word.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   Now on the same occasion there were some present who reported to him about the Galileans whose
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.280]   blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.880]   And Jesus said to them, "Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.640]   all other Galileans because they suffered this fate?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.480]   I tell you no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   Or do you suppose that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.240]   worse culprits than all the men who lived in Jerusalem?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.040]   I tell you no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.800]   And he began telling this parable.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.320]   A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.720]   on it and did not find any.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   And he said to the vineyard keeper, "Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.760]   on this fig tree without finding any.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.160]   Cut it down.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   Why does it even use up the ground?"
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   And he answered and said to him, "Let it alone, sir, for this year too until I dig around
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   it and put in fertilizer.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   And if it bears fruit next year, fine, but if it does not, cut it down."
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040]   Our God, we thank you for your precious Word.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.200]   Lord, we thank you for your grace in teaching us and guiding our hearts.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   We want to ask, Lord, that your Spirit would continue to sanctify every thought, every
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   desire, everything in terms of our attitude and even our emotions.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   I pray, Father God, that all of it would really be in conformity to your truth and your reality.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   We also take time to pray for Pastor Peter, praying, God, that as he travels, as he connects
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   with other pastors, Lord, that you give him grace and guidance and sustain to strength.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.520]   We also, Father Lord, take a moment to pray for the various things that are happening
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.480]   both in our own country and across the world.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   Father, there are so many, in this season, so many things that have occurred, cause for
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.000]   grief, cause for mourning and great loss.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.400]   We pray, Father God, that for those many who are involved, that your grace would be felt,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.960]   Lord, and that, God, your presence would all the more be known.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   Amen.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Okay.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.280]   I want to start this morning by gathering our thoughts to what is happening out in Houston,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280]   Texas.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.160]   You guys, I'm sure, have been following the news.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   You guys, I'm sure, have been talking with your coworkers and friends about the extent
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360]   of all that's been going on there.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.600]   And very much statistically, this is going to be one of the greatest tragedies that's
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.340]   happened in more recent history, in terms of US history.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.680]   With there being over 30,000 individuals who are displaced, so not only people who incurred
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.920]   damage to their home have lost precious values, et cetera, but people who have been displaced
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.200]   from their home, it's over 30,000.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.480]   People are trying to estimate the cost of all that flood water coming in, and they're
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   estimating that it's going to be well over $190 billion.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.120]   And just the extent of what's going on, I've been following carefully because a close friend
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.360]   of mine who I went to seminary with, he planted a church in Houston.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.160]   It's called Harvest Houston.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.840]   So when the news broke out, I saw on his feed people texting each other, him trying to reach
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.040]   out to certain friends, not being able to communicate the worry from a pastor's heart.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.200]   And then I see on his feed, he says, "I'm going to go buy a boat."
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.360]   Unfortunately, they're all sold out because people are just buying boats to try to save
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.760]   their family and friends.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.080]   Finally, he gets a boat, and he's out on the waters every day now.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.160]   He's been on the waters every day trying to save both his congregation members and his
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   neighbors.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.720]   So this has been quite just a tragedy, for lack of better words, in a lot of the things
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   that have been happening.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.960]   And as we take a moment to think about these things, perhaps for you and for a lot of people
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   who perhaps have friends, connections with it, there's a mixture of emotions.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   There can be mixtures of emotions of just disbelief, "I can't believe all that stuff
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   is happening."
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.400]   It can be the mixture of emotion of just sadness and sorrow for the people who have incurred
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.520]   so much loss.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.680]   Or there could be confusion, like, "Why in the world do these kind of things happen?
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960]   Disasters on this level, this scale?"
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.200]   Things that, again, hard for us to fathom maybe, but why do these things happen?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.520]   And in combination with all that, not only is there the flooding that's happening in
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   the States, things that are happening in Myanmar, things that are happening still in Syria.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.400]   You think about all these things, things that are happening in North Korea, and all around
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.740]   there are incredible crises, incredible things that cause us worry, anxiety, fear, sense
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.920]   of even frustration, anger, you know, anger at what's happening in the world.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.840]   So with this mix of emotions, what do we do?
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   With the mix of sentiments that we have, how do we navigate that?
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.240]   Well, the passage that I read in Luke chapter 13, it's an interesting passage because Jesus
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.400]   is giving a series of teaching, all in one gigantic sermon, so to speak, okay?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.800]   Jesus is in front of a massive crowd.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.000]   When you look at the passage, you don't have to turn there, but in chapter 12, you can
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.600]   see if you have the red-letter Bible with Jesus' words, it's like all red, right?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.000]   So what you notice is this is a long, long sermon that Jesus is teaching, and at the
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.720]   beginning of chapter 12, verse 1, it says that there was such a crowd, right, that people
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.160]   were climbing over each other.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.880]   So just imagine in an era where you have not a lot of, you know, I guess acoustics like
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   this where I have an amplified voice, and Jesus is teaching, and the people are so gathered,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.280]   and people are just coming, coming, coming.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.360]   I mean, he's a man who has known to heal, feed, you know, everything, right?
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.980]   People anticipating him as the Messiah.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.640]   So there has been an incredible crowd that has gathered around him, estimated maybe this
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   is, you know, upwards of 10,000 people, because that's not far off from the different crowds
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.680]   that he drew from previous times.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.160]   So in that kind of scenario, Jesus is teaching, and he says these interesting words to a scenario
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.960]   when some people have reported to him a great, great tragedy.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.680]   And so in light of the tragedy, we're going to learn some perspectives.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.640]   Here's the first one, okay?
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.280]   First perspective to think about.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.900]   In the midst of tragedies, we are challenged to change our expectation, okay?
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.760]   In the midst of tragedies, we are challenged to change our expectations.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   What I'm saying here is when you look at the story of what Jesus receives as a report,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.240]   take a look at verse 1 again, that on the same occasion, so again, same day as Jesus
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.840]   is teaching, there were some present who reported to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.000]   had mixed with their sacrifices.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.280]   Now that little story, like these Galilean whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   what is that?
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   Well, you can already tell by the reference of blood and mixing with the sacrifices that
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:03.080]   Pilate has killed these Galileans within the context of worship.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   So I want you to get kind of a picture of what's going on is in recent days, because
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.200]   in order for people to have been killed with sacrifices, there's a season when the Jewish
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.920]   people have a custom to offer up sacrifices.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.720]   There's only one season when your average Jew, not a high priest, not a specific line
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.360]   of the Levites, a priest goes in to give a sacrifice, but rather a regular individual
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.080]   can go and give sacrifices, and that's the time of Passover.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.440]   So what's interesting is in a very precious, in a very highly esteemed day of atonement,
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.800]   you know, the greatest day of the year, so to speak, for the Jewish people, you have
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.160]   individuals giving sacrifice and Pilate, who has a hatred for the Jews, Pilate, who has
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.520]   a history of shedding blood because he is a military man, much like many political figures
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.560]   who have taken the route of being in the military, rising up through the ranks, and then entering
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.240]   into politics, Pilate is that man.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.360]   He knows how to control people in the way that he knows how is to shed their blood,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   okay?
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.520]   So what you're seeing is a moment in which here is an individual that clearly has a reputation,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.720]   the Jews already despise him and he despises them, he actually goes and has the audacity
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.920]   to enter into sanctuary, right?
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.400]   To enter into sanctuary in the highest pinnacle point of the Jewish custom and slaughter individuals
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.720]   so that their blood will be mixed with the blood of their sacrifice.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.520]   That's the scenario, okay?
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.340]   Why do I describe that?
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.280]   Because then you can imagine the expectation of the people as they tell Jesus.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:55.440]   Jesus is perceived and presumed to be the one who would give them political victory,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.840]   right?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.640]   To give them deliverance from that oppression.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.400]   He's already proven to be a leader in that he's amassed thousands of people to come and
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   listen to him and so eagerly were the people wanting to make him their king.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.200]   And so they come with expectations telling him, "Look what's happened."
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.920]   And so almost, you know, implicit within the story as they say, "Look what's happened,"
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.960]   there is an expectation.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.120]   Perhaps they're expecting Jesus to be outraged.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.680]   Perhaps they're expecting the crowd as they hear this, because remember, this is all happening
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.080]   as they're given this report and Jesus is giving his response.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.000]   This is all happening in the context of the masses listening to him.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.480]   So perhaps these individuals were probably wanting to rally, just like in modern day
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.080]   right now, there's all these rallies of people championing their cause, whether it be right
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.480]   or wrong.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.280]   Right now we have a massive, just this political environment where people are saying, "We
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.320]   have to champion this cause and we have to champion that cause," right?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.880]   Perhaps that's what they were expecting.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:11.760]   Well, rather than Jesus giving this, you know, passion felt conviction deep, like, "How dare
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.920]   they," you know, perhaps that's what they expected, right?
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.920]   Jesus to just throw down some things, like, "How dare they," you know, "We need to gather
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.760]   our people and go.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.280]   We won't stand for this.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.880]   I'll go straight to the, you know, to the emperor," whatever it may be they might have
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.280]   expected.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.440]   That is not the case.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.200]   Rather the story goes, rather than Jesus having perhaps this sympathy for those in Galilee
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.680]   who have lost their lives, rather than giving this heart-wrenching, passionate speech, how
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.400]   we will not stand for injustice, how the Jewish people particularly have experienced oppression
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.280]   beyond so many other people.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.200]   I mean, the Jewish people particularly have experienced all kinds of oppression all through
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.840]   their history, right?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.480]   So contrary to expectation, Jesus rather gives them this pointed turnaround of the finger
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.080]   and says, "You might be pointing at the Roman government, but I'm pointing at you."
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:19.600]   So this is why I say we have to, we have to challenge our preconceived expectations because
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   many times, again, perhaps, again, this is not maybe for all of us experiencing this,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.200]   but there are times when we see injustice, there are times when we see certain kinds
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.280]   of pains and tragedies that people go through, and it actually offends us.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.720]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.440]   You hear something on the news of what's going on, and it actually, even though we're not
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.680]   necessarily in it or recipients of it, just the fact that it's happening and occurring
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.600]   in our day, it offends us, right?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.520]   And that's why you see, whether it be on social media, whether you see individuals who are
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   political figures or celebrities or whatever it may be, events happen and all of a sudden
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.800]   they come out swinging.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.120]   They come out angry and enraged.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Why?
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.440]   Well, a lot of times the reason why they come out enraged in that way is because when certain
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.720]   events happen, it offends and transgresses their standard.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.760]   So here's a challenge to us.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.880]   When certain things happen, and I'm not just obviously talking about natural disasters,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:29.160]   I'm talking about other major events in life, crisis, tragedies, you know, in these events
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.760]   we have to examine our own standard.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:39.120]   By which way, by which criteria am I evaluating and judging this scenario?
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.800]   And am I having an initial response because it's offended my standard, or am I having
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.400]   an initial response because it's offending God's standard?
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.200]   That is a very important question to ask, right?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.360]   Is it offending my standard or is it offending God's standard?
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.320]   And the reason why I go this is because sometimes for us, when we start asking the important
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.000]   questions or even the tough questions and sometimes even the more existential questions,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.960]   why is this happening?
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.720]   How is this possible?
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.360]   We go down that line and sometimes we have the danger of not just simply asking that
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.560]   question in curiosity, we have the danger of asking that question in complaint to God,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.720]   how are you allowing this to happen, God?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.320]   And we dare not do that, right?
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.280]   Because immediately then we recognize, once we have that tone and attitude towards God,
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.120]   we are no longer operating underneath His standard.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.600]   We're asking God, why have you transgressed mine?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.340]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.360]   And so by way of application, again, we have to make sure that we challenge how we are
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.160]   evaluating and perceiving the events that are happening.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.920]   Are we assessing and judging them based upon what we expect?
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.100]   Are we judging them based upon God's standard?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.520]   And there is now a question, what do we expect?
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:12.640]   Are natural disasters, political unrest, pain, suffering, are these things anomalies to you?
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.760]   Are these things strange, out of the norm occurrences that have no explanation, almost
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.600]   stuff that's like completely, you know, from out of this world?
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.360]   Do you perceive that perhaps your expectation is what we are granted in this life is to
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:34.640]   have a long life and the greatest tragedy would be to cut that short?
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.840]   Would that be the greatest tragedy?
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.480]   Because then we have to ask, what was your expectation for life on this earth?
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:49.440]   Well, this leads me to my point two, in light of various tragedies, we need to fear what
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.600]   should really be feared, okay?
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:58.480]   In light of various tragedies, we should learn to fear what really should be feared, okay?
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.720]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.400]   Well, in front of these masses, in front of the various people, what Jesus is presented
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.600]   with is a crime, right?
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.200]   You would even deem that like this heinous, almost terroristic kind of, you know, a crime
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   against humanity.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   I mean, who goes into the sacred place of God, who goes into the sanctuary of worship
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.280]   and goes in to slaughter individuals?
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   I mean, that's stuff that we only hear of.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.400]   That's only stuff that we can only see in maybe movies of those individuals who are
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:39.240]   the most vile, wicked terrorists of our generation, right?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.040]   Well, in light of that, again, I point to the fact that Jesus says this.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.720]   Go to verse two, Luke chapter 13 verse two, "And Jesus said to them, 'Do you suppose that
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.520]   these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   this fate?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.400]   I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.'"
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.840]   Okay?
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:13.560]   When I read that passage, I'm not, again, I'm not trying to show you something that
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:19.600]   is like novel, brand new, and something that we've never heard of, but something that perhaps
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.120]   challenges our perception of what is the greatest tragedy in our lives.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.560]   Because according to Jesus' words, the greatest tragedy is not that a crime took place.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.320]   Now, He's not just simply being insensitive.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.360]   He's not simply being dismissive.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:41.280]   He's not being cowardice and saying, "Oh, well, what can we do against the mighty Romans?"
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.240]   He is seeing things in the reality of faith.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.720]   He is seeing things in the reality of Christian faith, of how God in truth has told us what
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.920]   is actually real.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.360]   That heaven exists, hell exists, and the greatest tragedy is not simply that a select few were
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.080]   slaughtered in the temple.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.600]   Rather, many are dying.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.080]   Many are dying and on their path to eternal destruction.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.380]   What's worse than the greatest torture?
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.260]   What's worse than being inflicted by some heinous, wicked individual?
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.480]   What's worse than anything you can imagine?
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.720]   Jesus has a perspective that is quite far different than the theology, superstition,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.240]   and the expectations of the people.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.760]   And Jesus calls it out almost.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.280]   He says, "You presume," basically.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   He looks at them and says, "Do you suppose that you are less of sinners?
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.520]   Do you suppose that they were greater sinners?"
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.400]   Within that, Jesus calls out their expectation.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.120]   See, you operate under the age-old wisdom that if you do well, you'll have a long,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.760]   prosperous life, right?
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.840]   And you operate under the age-old wisdom that if you're suffering, then perhaps you have
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.800]   some kind of hidden sin in your life.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   Perhaps somehow you weren't faithful.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.000]   Perhaps somehow you were doing something wrong, right?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.680]   I mean, wasn't that the age-old wisdom that all of Job's friends operated under?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.400]   You guys remember that?
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.200]   Job experiences an incredible amount of suffering.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.840]   Like literally everything he has is being ripped away from him, his children, his family,
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.440]   his wealth, his health, because Satan desired to affect him and pain him in every facet
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   of his life.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.760]   So he took away all of his wealth, his reputation, and then he lastly struck his own body, right?
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.120]   Now at that point, remember Job said, "I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.520]   I have a case against God because I have no idea what's going on."
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   And his friends came and said, "Well, we know that stuff just doesn't happen for no reason.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.800]   Come on, man, spit it out.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   What were you doing?
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   What sin do you have?"
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Right?
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.960]   They were operating underneath that kind of theology and that kind of typical logic that
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.160]   good people receive good and bad people receive bad.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.720]   That is the typical theology of today.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   And that is nothing more than superstition.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   It is not Christian.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   It is not godly.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   It's not even wise.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.120]   It's not even realistic.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.440]   It is just superstitious.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.720]   I put in some coins here, put in some coins there, do good works there, and ba-dam, I've
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.920]   got a prosperous life.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.720]   That is superstition, right?
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   But rather, Jesus is talking about pointing to the greater spiritual reality.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.640]   The greater spiritual reality is that every single individual will perish.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.680]   The greater spiritual reality is that each and every single one of us has a very small
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.000]   allotted time.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.040]   The greater spiritual reality is that we are all destined heading for death, and after
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.460]   that comes judgment.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:05.680]   And so in Christ's perspective, He is looking at something greater and beyond what the people
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   of His time are.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.960]   You know, earlier I mentioned that this is one really long sermon that Jesus is giving
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   in one context in front of a massive load of people, right?
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.160]   Well, if you actually now turn back to chapter 12 at the beginning of this, okay?
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   So go on Luke.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.680]   And just go page over to chapter 12.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.000]   Starting from verse 1, I'm going to read this passage to us, and it just says, "Under these
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.960]   circumstances, after so many thousands of people had gathered together, they were stepping
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.520]   on one another.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   He began saying to His disciples, 'First of all, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.800]   which is hypocrisy.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.560]   But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   known.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.840]   According to whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.360]   you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.920]   I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.880]   have no more that they can do.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.360]   But I will warn you whom to fear.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.480]   Fear the one who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.120]   Yes, I tell you, fear Him.'"
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   He says, "Fear Him."
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.120]   So I ask you this question again.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.080]   What was our expectation and what are we fearing most of all in this life?
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.240]   Are we fearing those great tragedies?
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.320]   Are we fearing, "Oh, like the worst life possible would be to be oppressed by some individual
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.720]   and I'd have to work some, you know, menial job under some horrible boss."
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.160]   Is that the worst case scenario for you?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:52.000]   Well, later on, that same chapter, verse 49, Jesus says, "Shattering expectation, I have
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.720]   come to cast fire upon this earth and how I wish it were already kindled.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.000]   But I have a baptism to undergo and how distressed I am until it is accomplished.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.600]   Do you suppose I came to grant peace on earth?
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.960]   I tell you, no, but rather division.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.680]   From now on, five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   against three.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.400]   They will be divided father against son and son against father, mother against daughter
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.040]   and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.120]   against mother-in-law."
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   So we think about this whole concept here, the first two points.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:41.440]   One, challenging our expectation, but two, realizing that the typical stuff that we fear
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.800]   is only a fear that exists in the context of our expectation.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.680]   But the reality that Christ is presenting to us shatters those expectations and also
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.000]   shatters those fears.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.800]   The things that we should fear are not threats to our well-being and health.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.040]   The thing that we should fear is the threat to our soul.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.440]   The thing that we should fear is eternal judgment and damnation from God.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.720]   And so whether it is, yes, by way of just kind of quickly thinking about this, whether
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.160]   it is the natural disaster of Hurricane Harvey, whether it is the oppression that people experience
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:25.720]   because of corrupt regimes, corrupt governments, whether it is simply suffering that people
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.800]   experience because daily living, those things, yes, you should care about.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.880]   I am not saying diminish those things, don't care for it and just sit on your butt.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.360]   I am all the more challenged by my friend, his name is Brian, by my friend Brian who
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.520]   bought a boat to go save his congregation members and his friends.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.560]   I'm all the more encouraged by the people who researched are there opportunities for
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.040]   me to go actually volunteer, took time off work and went.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.160]   I'm all the more encouraged by people who are giving their finances for these causes
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.840]   of helping individuals.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   Do it.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.880]   If God has laid it on your heart to see the sufferings of the people who are weak in need,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.320]   don't close your heart, do it.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:16.440]   But the reality is that is not our greatest cause because that is not the greatest need,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.960]   right?
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   I almost, when I was preparing this sermon, I was fearful of saying that because in a
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   moment like this when so many people are suffering, in occasion like this when people are suffering
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:35.040]   in a fashion by which I have never experienced, I was fearful of saying it because someone
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.960]   could look at me and say, "How dare you say that?
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.800]   You have no idea."
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   And that's true.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.720]   I have no idea what they're going through right now.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.240]   But the fact of the matter is Scripture teaches us and Jesus teaches us, yes, people have
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   need.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.640]   Yes, there are orphans, there are widows, there are people who are suffering, there
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.080]   are people in poverty.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   And yes, we as Christians have a great responsibility to them, right?
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   Because we receive the love of God.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.960]   But that isn't our greatest cause.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   Why?
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.320]   Because that isn't the greatest need.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.360]   The greatest need is the greatest fear.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.200]   The greatest fear is that people would die without hope and that for all eternity, not
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:21.800]   for their breath on life, but for all eternity, they would experience hell apart, separated
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.400]   from the sweet love of God.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.680]   Until then, now, it challenges us.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   By base minimum, we should be giving people who are in need physical supply, help, and
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.640]   strength.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.820]   We should be all the more fearful.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.880]   We should be all the more moved.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:48.480]   We should be grieved if we see people who are dying without grace, dying without the
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.680]   gospel.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.660]   Do you see how that challenges our paradigm?
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.680]   Base minimum is to help people who are suffering.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   Our greatest ambition, sharing the gospel with those who are lost.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:10.240]   The problem though, as we think about this, is perhaps our paradigm of what is the deliverance
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.540]   that we need.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.680]   What is the thirst that we need to have quenched?
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.380]   We presume it's the stuff of the world, but we need to be challenged.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.980]   No, the greatest need isn't water for thirst.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.220]   It is the words of life to those who are eternally condemned.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.500]   The greatest need is the gospel to deliver them from eternal fire to eternal life.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.020]   That is the greatest need and therefore our greatest cause.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:42.460]   What's more, further thinking about this, please go back to chapter 13, verse 6.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:52.540]   Jesus, in emphasizing the point, okay, emphasizing the teaching, he goes on to give a parable,
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.980]   an interesting parable.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.340]   So verse 6 says, "And he began telling this parable.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.380]   A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.180]   on it and did not find any.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   And he said to the vineyard keeper, 'Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.780]   on this fig tree without finding any.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.620]   Cut it down.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.660]   Why does it even use up the ground?'
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:22.300]   And he answered and said to him, 'Let it alone, sir, for this year too until I dig around
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:28.180]   it, put in fertilizer and if it bears fruit next year, fine, but if it does not, cut it
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.260]   down.'"
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.540]   So what is he trying to highlight?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.020]   Well the point I want to make is this, point three.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.500]   The first point was we need to challenge our expectations.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.180]   Second point, we need to fear what actually needs to be feared.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.020]   Third point, we have to realize, okay, in light of the tragedies, we're all living on
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.140]   borrowed time, okay?
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.940]   We're all living on borrowed time.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:29:01.180]   This is a perspective changer, you know, especially for those of us who naively presume, naively
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.900]   presume we just have the rest of our lives to live, we have so much to look forward to.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.860]   There's just, you know, I'm looking at my life right now, sometimes I get kind of amazed
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.420]   thinking like, you know, there are days when I feel a little older, I'm getting a lot more
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.980]   gray hair and stuff, and I start thinking, 'Oh, I feel old,' especially recently I went
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.820]   to a youth group retreat and I just felt even more old because I was, we were in Big Bear,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.540]   I was like breathing hard, and everything just kind of told me, my body just told me,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   'You're old,' right?
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.740]   But I'm not old, you know?
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.420]   Given that the vast majority of Americans live till they're like 80, I've got like 50
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.940]   more years to live, which is crazy to think about, right?
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.140]   Well that is, yes, a reality in some sense.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.740]   With your eyes, when you're looking at people, how long they're living, you might be thinking,
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.140]   'There's just many years to live, I've got like 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, you know, years to
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.980]   live.'
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.380]   That is a gross presumption, right?
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:03.820]   It was Jesus' regular teaching, 'You do not know when your life will be required of you.'
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.380]   All of you who are building your barns, building bigger barns, putting more stuff in your barn,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.860]   and then needing bigger barns, you do not know when your life is expected of you.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:19.900]   It is a gross presumption for the regular American to just presume, 'I've got so many
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.580]   years to live.'
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.740]   And tragedies where thousands of people are dying, when thousands of people are being
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:33.540]   displaced, again, the number of people who have died out in Myanmar and Syria is just
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.780]   staggering, okay?
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:42.580]   These kind of tragedies remind us we are living on borrowed time.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.900]   And it is a misconception, false worldview for us to presume we just have the world to
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.300]   live.
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:31:00.260]   In this parable, we have the landowner, and the whole land belongs to him.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.940]   And the fact of the matter is he is looking at these plants who are just taking up real
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.300]   estate, and he says, 'Cut it down.'
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:18.780]   The point of the parable is that the vineyard keeper has asked the Lord, right?
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.340]   The master of the field, 'Give it just a little bit more.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   Let me fertilize.'
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.340]   Right?
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.820]   That's the point.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.300]   And then he says, 'But afterwards, cut it down if you will.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.620]   If there is no fruit, just cut it down.'
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.180]   Essentially the point of it is you are living on borrowed time.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.380]   Judgment will come.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:44.180]   Whether it is the year or whatever it may be, the time that God has set, judgment will
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.180]   come.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.900]   And so that's why if you remember the last sermon that I preached two weeks ago, I made
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:55.620]   much of 2 Peter chapter 3, that this is exactly what the apostles are teaching us.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.420]   This is exactly the message we should be receiving in our generation.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.940]   This is not just a parable for Jesus' generation 2,000 years ago.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.900]   This is even more relevant to us now, 2,000 years later.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.500]   Is it not?
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.540]   It's more relevant to us now, 2,000 years later, than even when Jesus spoke it to his
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.020]   generation, the masses in front of him.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:22.380]   But what's more, just the passage for you in 2 Peter chapter 3, verses 8 and 9, Apostle
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.220]   Peter taught us, 'But do not let this one fact escape your notice, that with the Lord,
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.660]   one day is like a thousand years, a thousand years like one day.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:38.260]   The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but he is patient towards
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:45.340]   you, not wishing for any to perish, but to come to repentance.'
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.260]   That is an amazing passage teaching us.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.580]   We might count it slow because our linear timeline is like, that, that, that, that,
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.580]   year to year.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:59.620]   He says, 'No, this short time is a time of patience to you.'
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.580]   And that's why if you go back to Luke chapter 12, please turn to this verse with me.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.820]   Luke chapter 12, in the context of all these sermons, taking a look at verse 54, okay,
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:16.900]   we read earlier verse 49, but taking a look at verse 54, he says this, 'And he was also
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.020]   saying to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'A
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.860]   shower is coming,' and so it turns out.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.740]   And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, 'It will be a hot day,' and it turns
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.820]   out that way.'"
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.500]   You hypocrites.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.740]   You know how to analyze the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.980]   analyze this present time?
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.260]   Why do you not analyze this present time?
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.460]   Why are you so dull to not know judgment is coming?
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:54.980]   When there's rumors of war, natural disasters, why do you not think that disaster is coming?
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.620]   And that's what I want to highlight to us.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:05.180]   I am not going to be one of those guys who are like, you know, January 2018, "Jesus
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   is coming.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.180]   I can see it now."
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.580]   You know, I don't know.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.580]   You don't know.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.580]   Jesus said, "You just don't know.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.100]   That's not for you to know."
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.060]   But clearly, the generations have become more wicked.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.660]   The value of life has become, you know, diminished.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.260]   Apostle Paul said, "In the last days, there's going to be greedy individuals, lovers of
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.860]   evil, haters of good, and you're going to hear," and Jesus taught, "You're going
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.580]   to hear all these rumors of war.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.940]   You're going to see natural disasters."
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:40.700]   I feel, maybe it's not going to be in my lifetime, but I feel like, my goodness, I
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.820]   better be sober because it can come any day, right?
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.060]   Well, here's the dilemma though.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.940]   Along with our presumption that we have so much time to live, we presume we have both
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.860]   so much time to live and we are okay.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.420]   We see in our generation amongst the spiritual climate of Christianity that there is perhaps
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.460]   a spiritual lethargy, maybe just a lack of passion.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.920]   We see a lack of urgency.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.780]   Perhaps there is an incredible amount of flippant behavior in the church.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.900]   Perhaps there's an incredible amount of casual, familiar approach to their life as
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.900]   a Christian.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.340]   And what that tells me is there is a presumption.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:27.660]   Not only do I have plenty of time to get it straight, I am okay the way I am.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.540]   That is an incredible, gross presumption, is it not?
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.220]   And that is exactly what Jesus points to.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.020]   The people come saying, "Oh my goodness, there is this crime," and Jesus points the
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:46.220]   finger and he goes, "Zoop," but look at you.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:53.380]   Are you any safer of the judgment that those criminals deserve?
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:58.220]   Are you any safer from the fires of hell?
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.700]   Rain will come down, yes, but you know what he's referring to is the rain of God's
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.460]   wrath and we've been studying in the book of Revelations and it's been causing me
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.620]   to be afraid because that's the point.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:16.100]   When God comes in His authority and in His glory, it is going to be a scary thing.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:22.300]   We're going to, people are going to tremble like none other, but it is a gross presumption.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.180]   I have plenty of time and I'm okay.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:31.340]   And Jesus asks the very point in question, "Do you presume that you are less of a
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   sinner?
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.900]   Do you presume that they are more?"
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.300]   And so going back into it, he actually points to another tragedy.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.220]   Over in verse 4, it says, "Or do you presume that those 18 on whom the tower and Siloam
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.220]   fell."
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.740]   Now, supposedly what happened was people were walking by the tower of Siloam.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.940]   It just so happened maybe it was one of these like leaning tower of Pisa things and everyone's
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.340]   like sitting there like with the photos.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.100]   It just so happened it fell on 18 individuals and they died.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.220]   Perhaps if you're operating under, again, the wisdom of the world, they're thinking,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.520]   "Well, I walked by and I didn't fall, it didn't fall on me, but they walked by, probably
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.860]   something was wrong with them."
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.700]   No, Jesus says, "Do you presume?
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.620]   Do you presume that those 18 on whom the tower at Siloam fell and killed them were worse
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.580]   culprits than all the men who lived in Jerusalem?
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.100]   I tell you no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.340]   There is a gross presumption in our generation where everyone thinks they're godly.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.220]   Everyone thinks they're Christian.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   Everyone thinks they're safe.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:38.440]   But I want you to remember that was exactly the time of Jesus.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.780]   Everybody held to a certain ritualistic standard.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.620]   Everybody thought the Messiah was coming.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:48.700]   You remember how many people welcomed in Jesus as the Lord and asked Him to save them and
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.180]   said, "You're the son of David.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.140]   You're the Messiah."
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.420]   Every individual in Jerusalem washed their hands and thought they were clean.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.060]   He's not talking to wretched sinners who are like killing people.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:05.300]   He's talking to wretched sinners who just believe in a false religion.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.620]   They're just incredibly religious, incredibly blinded to the fact that they're dirty in
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.620]   the art.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.460]   They just know, but I'm clean on the outside.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:25.700]   So with that being said, again, by way of application for us, yes, not every tragedy,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.500]   not every crisis is because like, "Oh, there must be some gross sin in me."
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:37.900]   But still, every opportunity or every tragedy is an opportunity for us to assess our heart.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.300]   Clearly we should be sober.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.300]   Am I sober?
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:48.340]   Clearly these things are regular patterns of life in a world decayed by sin where people
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.940]   are being oppressed.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.140]   They're being exploited.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.780]   But am I being sober then?
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.860]   Am I one of sanctified hearts?
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.900]   There's a passage that rocked me when I was studying the Old Testament.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.580]   It says, "The man who acts presumptuously by not listening and heeding the priest who
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.340]   stands there to serve the Lord your God, nor to judge, that man shall die.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.300]   Thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:21.260]   Then all the people will hear and be afraid and will not act presumptuously again."
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:25.540]   I believe there is this sentiment, especially in a generation.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.480]   I want to ask this question, okay?
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:35.560]   In the midst of great tragedy, in the midst of turmoil and crisis, you have amassed a
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.820]   people of 20,000 people.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.940]   So imagine with me that there is a convention, there is a conference talking about how we
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.900]   should respond to these tragedies, what we should do about these gross crimes against
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.480]   humanity that is happening in our day and time.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   And you have 20,000 people and you've been asked to come speak a word to them of encouragement.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   What do you speak?
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.260]   What do you say?
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.000]   In our generation, most likely how the peace and love of God is going to comfort their
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.640]   hearts, how the love of God pervades and transcends it all.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:23.520]   Well in this time, Jesus actually in the midst of 20,000, 10,000 people, a huge, huge crowd,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.000]   his exhortation and encouragement to them is, "Please in the moment of tragedy, do not
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.600]   think presumptuously.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.640]   Don't think, 'Of course I'm on God's side.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.080]   Don't think, 'Of course God will deliver me.'
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.800]   Don't think, 'Of course.'
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.040]   That is presumptuousness.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.880]   Even though, I mean I feel like this is the mantra of our day, "Even though I keep failing,
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:54.640]   even though I keep sinning, even though I keep dishonoring God, disobeying, it's fine.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.280]   God will always accept me.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.080]   I'll always be saved."
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.760]   Let that not be the mantra of our day, but rather, this is going to be the last point,
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.880]   rather, in every scenario, learn to fear God.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.320]   In every scenario, learn to fear God.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.960]   What am I saying with this, that we should learn to fear God?
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.880]   The parable, the passage before, all of it points to this one idea.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.240]   In these moments of great tragedy, you might fear loss, pain, oppression.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.520]   You might fear lots of things, and I'm going to be honest with you, I am a worrywart, and
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.200]   that's why I take forever to make decisions, because I have to calculate what's going to
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.560]   be the cost of this decision, what's going to be the negative of that decision.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.560]   Yes, some of you guys are like me.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.200]   You guys are very quick to calculate every kind of risk.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.960]   You're like experts at risk management, and so you take a long time to decide things,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.480]   because you have to make sure you examine it from every angle.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   That's me.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   What does that make me do?
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480]   It makes me worry a lot.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:03.400]   It's like, "But if I do this, but if I do that, and I play that game, it's like, huh,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   huh, huh," right?
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:12.360]   Well, in that scenario, you could sit there until the day is done, analyzing all the risks.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.440]   You can sit there looking at, "Oh, but what are we going to do about the Romans?
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.800]   What are we going to do about that president, this president, those terrorists, and this
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   and that?"
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.960]   Yes, again, those are things that God has given us wisdom and eyes to see, but in the
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   end, Jesus is challenging the whole mass.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.960]   You need to fear God, because that's what He says implicitly.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.920]   That's what He says explicitly.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.640]   Going back to that passage in chapter 12, verse 1 through 5, I'm just going to read
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.320]   it for you again.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.280]   He says that there were these people all gathered, and He said, "Began saying to His disciples,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.760]   first of all, 'Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, the pervasive, sinful attitude
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.160]   of the Pharisees, whose worldview is corrupting you.'"
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   Okay?
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.440]   And then He says, "These are hypocrites.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.320]   They're fake and phony, but there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, hidden
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   that will not be known."
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   What is He saying?
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.840]   You need to fear God, because He knows everything.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:12.240]   He's going to expose every vile and wicked individual, whether it's by word, by thought,
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.680]   by action, everything will be exposed.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.200]   What does that mean?
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   You need to fear the One who will expose you.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.880]   You need to fear the God who knows it all.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.160]   And then He goes on, "Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.680]   light, and whatever you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.680]   hilltops.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:36.160]   I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body."
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.280]   After that, they have no more that they can do.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.720]   "But I will warn you, I will warn you of this, of whom to fear.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.840]   Fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.960]   Yes, I tell you, fear Him."
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.480]   Look at how emphatic He's teaching him.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:59.120]   "I tell you now, yes, I do, the One you must fear who will expose you, who knows all
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.320]   things, who is so much more powerful than that Roman soldier, so much more powerful
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.320]   than that Roman elite, so much more powerful than the crisis at hand, so much more powerful
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.920]   than the tragedy that you feel like you cannot control.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.720]   It's frustrating you.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:22.920]   Fear Him who has ultimate power and authority over both our lives here and our souls into
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   eternity."
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.680]   And so that is a challenge for us.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.360]   We sometimes neglect to fear the One.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   Sometimes I talk to people.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.400]   You know, sometimes I come in and we strategize about how to do ministry.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.480]   We start thinking and strategizing about, you know, what's the most efficient, effective
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.000]   way to go about doing the work of God.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.320]   And you know what the really interesting is?
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:54.680]   Sometimes when you think too much about strategy, plan, efficiency, product, what happens is
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.400]   God gets left out.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.440]   Like our conversation doesn't involve God much at all, right?
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:06.360]   And I think there, even in that, there is a misconception.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.520]   Even in that, there is a worldview that's off.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:14.600]   So I want to challenge you and conclude with this, okay?
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.400]   In your worldview, we challenge, today we talked about in light of tragedies, it does
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.720]   shake us up.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   It does cause us to question.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   It does cause us to feel certain sentiments.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.180]   And in the midst of that, number one, let's make sure that we are challenging our own
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:36.600]   expectation and worldview, what we believe to be right, normal, and acceptable.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:43.400]   Number two, let's make sure that we actually have the fear of what should really be feared,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.480]   a correct assessment of what is a genuine tragedy.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.920]   What is the worst of all?
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.880]   What is the worst case scenario?
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.360]   Is it just the loss of comforts?
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.820]   Is it just the loss of possessions?
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:04.400]   We talked about the third point, that we have to recognize that we all live on borrowed
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   time, that there should be a sense of urgency.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.960]   In the midst of tragedies, there should be a sense of understanding that we all have
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:17.160]   a very small allotted time to live, and it is our wrong perception that we have so much
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   ahead of us.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:25.120]   But lastly, that we need to learn to fear God in every circumstance, that in the midst
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.240]   of all of this, if we're not looking to the majesty of God, if we're not looking
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.200]   reverentially at the supremacy of His sovereignty, if we're not looking in fearfulness of what
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.640]   He could do, if we're not looking in hope at what He can provide, if we're not looking
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:48.720]   with anticipation of how He will come, then we're actually missing the point of every
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.520]   opportunity that we have, every moment of learning that we have.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:00.640]   And so I want to challenge you with that last thing, that as Jesus commands us, perhaps,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.600]   perhaps we might have a presumption that we're less sinners, and the only ones deserving
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:11.640]   of hell is the Hitlers, the Stalins, and the, you know, the dictators of this world, but
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:18.160]   rather we must make sure that we are actually looking to Him with every, every ounce of
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.400]   anticipation and trust, not presuming like the rest of the world, but rather trusting
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400]   as we have power in Christ.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.880]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.520]   Amen.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:39.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
