[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Okay, let's, good morning everybody.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.000]   Let's take our Bibles and turn over to Matthew chapter 23.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   What a great and powerful song for us to sing to God.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.440]   Keep those chorus words in mind.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440]   He's holy.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.280]   There's no one else like him.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.560]   And if there is no one else like him, our entire life's struggle is to make sure that
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.280]   we build our life on nothing else but besides him.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.280]   Amen.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.320]   Now, as we turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 23, just want to, as a heads up, you know,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.240]   we've had like an amazing walk through Hebrews, and so we're going to be changing tone to
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.560]   a passage later in the Gospel of Matthew, and the tone's going to be really different.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.600]   You know, we had five-part sermon on what it really means to walk with perseverance,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.400]   looking up and forward, et cetera, and looking to Christ and thinking about his love.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.520]   The tone of this passage, it's drastically different.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.000]   The scenario is that as Jesus is walking towards the cross, the religious leaders at the time,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.320]   they constantly challenge him, they desire to trap him, and then they throw at him a
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.960]   barrage of attacks.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   And in the midst of that, Jesus exhibits himself as such an authority, people are astounded,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.300]   and they're put into a place where they dare not ask him any more questions.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.960]   And as the tables turn, Jesus pummels them, the religious leaders, into the ground.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.480]   And so the tone of this passage is severe.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.280]   Let's take a moment to read.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   We're reading in Matthew 23, verses 1 through 12, and it says, "Then Jesus spoke to the
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   crowds and to his disciples, saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   in the chair of Moses.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   Therefore all that they tell you to do, I'll tell you, do and observe, but do not do according
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.380]   to their deeds, for they say things and do not do them.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.440]   They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.560]   to move them with so much as a finger.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.760]   But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men, for they broaden their phylacteries
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.300]   and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues, and respectful
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.360]   greetings in the marketplaces, and being called rabbi by men.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.620]   Do not be called rabbi, for one is your teacher and you are all brothers.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.260]   Do not call anyone on earth your father, for one is your father, he who is in heaven.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.260]   Do not be called leaders, for one is your leader, that is Christ.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.380]   The greatest among you shall be your servant.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.740]   Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted."
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.860]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.480]   Heavenly Father, as we take a look at your Word, we pray that as we're looking at Jesus's
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.440]   rebuke of the religious leaders of the time, God, that you'd grant to us insight, that
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.840]   you would grant to us humble hearts and open ears to receive.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.280]   And as we sometimes hear the correction, admonishment, and rebuke from the Word, I pray, Father God,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.520]   that it would humble us and mold us into the image of your Son.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.280]   And so we pray for blessing now as we study your Word, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.840]   So as we think about this passage, Jesus, I just want you to imagine, there has already
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.720]   been back and forth.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.560]   Like we got a question for you, you know, is it proper to pay taxes, you know?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.880]   We got a question for you, if this guy, he dies, and then his wife marries a brother,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   and then da-da-da-da-da, what's it going to be in heaven, you know?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.120]   And there's lots of questions thrown at him.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.160]   So there's already a crowd watching and exhibiting all that's going on between Jesus and these
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.200]   Pharisees and scribes, but what he does is he's actually first not talking to them, he's
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.740]   talking to the crowd and showing them what they need to see.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.040]   And what he does is he tells the crowd, "Look at these Pharisees and scribes."
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.840]   Now for us in our day, when we think the word Pharisee, it's like a derogatory term, you
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   know?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.440]   If I call one of you like, "Man, you're such a Pharisee," you'd be like, "Oh, what you
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   call me?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.760]   How dare you?"
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.920]   Because to be a Pharisee in the Christian circles, it's like you are the worst in the
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   church.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.220]   You legalistic, self-righteous, pompous, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay?
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.020]   And so to call somebody a Pharisee would be a horrible thing.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.500]   And there's an interesting sentiment here because if you think about the scenario then,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.460]   you have to kind of put yourself in not the shoes of the scribe or the Pharisee himself,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.140]   but maybe you first want to think about if you were a good Jewish individual going to
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.500]   synagogue every week, multiple times a week, doing the offerings, sitting and listening
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.940]   to the sermons, preaching a proclamation of the Old Testament, you were at the feet of
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.220]   these religious leaders, getting their guidance on how to set your life and all the parameters
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.900]   that exist, and then you just hear this onslaught, right?
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.500]   And you would imagine then if you were in here and your whole life you were looking
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.260]   at these guys like, "Yeah, you know, I'm not, I know I'm not like them, but these guys,
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.700]   they're holy," you know?
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.780]   And then you see, you hear of this Jesus who's preaching with authority, doing miracles come
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.220]   in and just completely demolish them.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.740]   You would have a very eerie feeling, right?
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.300]   But that eerie feeling would cause you to think like, "Is it that bad?"
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.620]   I know I see some of this, like I see their arrogance, I see them walking around in the
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.900]   courtyards, I see them walking around in the places of honor, and I would wonder like how
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.620]   did they think about this?
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   Now to simply ask the question, "Is it that bad?"
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.180]   The answer is yes.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:48.940]   I want you to take a look at Matthew 23 and hear the onslaught.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:58.620]   Starting from verse 13, Jesus rebukes them in such severity, we have to feel that extent
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.420]   of severity.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.020]   And what he says is, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, because you
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.900]   shut off the kingdom of heaven from people.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.300]   You do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:21.980]   You bullies, you act like some kind of guides, but in fact, you're just like bully bouncers,
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.820]   just standing outside."
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.820]   What's more, verse 14, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.220]   widows' houses, and for pretense you make long prayers."
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:42.860]   Yikes, I mean, you can be a bad guy, but to take advantage and exploit widows, old ladies,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.460]   you're like the worst of the worst.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.660]   Verse 15, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around, sea
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.380]   and land, make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.060]   son of hell as you are."
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.740]   Verse 16, "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it's nothing,
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.340]   but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, it's obligated.'"
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:14.020]   You fools, blind men, which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.020]   gold?
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.460]   He's saying, "You're so blind, you have no idea what's priority.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.420]   You don't even know what's important.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.100]   You don't know what's good, bad.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   You don't know what's up here or down here."
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.100]   That's severe.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.300]   It just keeps going.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:34.180]   Verse 23, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, you tie mint and dill and
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.540]   cumin and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law."
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.260]   Verse 25, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you clean the outside
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:49.260]   of the cup of the dish, that inside you are full of robbery and self-indulgence."
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.780]   I'm already getting winded going through these, but you see, it just keeps going.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:02.140]   He calls them for their hypocrisy of looking nice on the outside, but being so decayed
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.980]   and ugly on the inside.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.340]   Verse 29, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites, for you build the tombs of
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.380]   the prophets and adore the monuments of the righteous and say, 'If we had been living
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.980]   in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the shedding the
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.980]   blood of the prophets.'"
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.540]   What are they saying?
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.460]   We're so much better than those old guys, we would have never done that.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.260]   They make monuments to the people before them, their forefathers, and then they criticize
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.620]   them and put themselves above them.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.980]   You self, right?
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.260]   And it just keeps going.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.660]   Verse 33, "You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?"
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.260]   That is not a question, even though it has a question mark.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.460]   That's a statement, you will not.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.460]   You're going to be judged for all your hypocrisy, arrogance, and sin.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.180]   Wow.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.860]   Doesn't it make you feel eerie that it's that bad?
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.420]   But I'm willing to bet some of you now feel like that about today's generation.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.360]   You have celebrity pastors going up and crashing down.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.140]   You have people who are world-renowned, filled with heinous sin on the inside, when it looked
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.360]   so good on the outside.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.180]   It looks so polished.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.740]   It looks so right.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.220]   Only to find that it was decay.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.260]   It was a farce.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.860]   It was fake.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.180]   And these kind of disappointments make us feel like, yeah, I can sympathize with this
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.780]   weird sentiment that the system around us is all messed up.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.700]   I didn't have better, more elaborate terms.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.420]   It just feels sometimes all messed up.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.020]   How are we to think about it then?
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:58.020]   And so this is why as I prepared this sermon, I was like, man, this is intense.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.140]   This is surprising for some of us who are just like surprised by the intensity and the
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.900]   severity and the sharp cutting edge of Jesus' words.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.480]   This has to be felt.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.740]   And then I thought, you know what?
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.300]   I have to reflect Jesus' heart.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.640]   As Jesus is going to the cross, He loves His disciples.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.740]   So what does He do?
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.740]   He warns.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.700]   So purpose number one of the sermon, I'm not just trying to scare you with this passage.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.020]   I'm trying to do justice to what it's doing, which is it should appropriately warn you.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:41.100]   If you have been taught by modern day and age old lies, everything's going to get better
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.260]   in time.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.020]   You and I, we can do this, you guys.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.740]   We could have a great, great future, and we're going to have great churches, great families,
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.180]   great government, and it's going to be awesome.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.580]   God has already told you in the last days, there are going to be more mockers, more false
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.460]   preachers, more deception.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.860]   People will be haters of that, which is good.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.620]   There's going to be conflict, and it's going to get worse.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.780]   I just want to warn you.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.980]   There are many those who are around us who are going to tell you falsehood and leave
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.900]   you bad examples.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.700]   First John chapter four, verse one says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.740]   spirits to see whether they are from God.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.340]   For many," how many do you think is many?
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.940]   "Many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.540]   As a pastor in this church, as a fellow brother, I want to warn you just as Jesus did, beware
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.820]   of the yeast of the Pharisees."
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.780]   To influence the model, the teaching of the Pharisees, you have to be on the alert.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:56.340]   First Peter two, one through three, it says, "False prophets also arose among the people."
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.860]   Do you think you're safe because you're here?
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.300]   Don't look at each other with suspicion, but the scriptures are clear.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.900]   In the broader community, is it like surprise?
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.500]   Are you completely caught off guard if one who claims to be a Christian, who says that
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.460]   they are the thought leaders, now that's a kind of coined term, I want to be a thought
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:26.340]   leader, now becomes something of an individual who produces what here says is, "There are
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:32.100]   those among you," just as there will be false teachers among you, "who will secretly introduce
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.500]   destructive heresies, even denying the master who bought them, bringing swift destruction
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.940]   upon themselves.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.020]   Many will follow their sensuality.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.300]   Because of them, the way of the truth is malign, and in their greed, they will exploit you
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.100]   with false words."
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.680]   And I have this feeling right now in this generation, here in 2021, there has been lots
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.940]   of people saying lots of stuff, and just as a brother, I have a worry.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.700]   I'm like, "Oh man, are people listening to all this trash?
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.780]   Are you listening to nothing but news?
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.780]   What's going on?"
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:18.660]   But Scripture, knowingly, already ahead of the game, has given us this exhortation.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.500]   Can you, are you ready to test the spirits?
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.880]   I give that challenge to you.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.940]   Can you tell the difference?
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.860]   Are you able to appreciate that which is sound teaching from the Word of God versus that
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.900]   which is just the opinion of man?
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.960]   Are you able to tell the difference between that which is simply worldly wisdom that has
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.820]   the hint of wisdom because it's still wisdom, but far from the wisdom of God?
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.940]   Can you tell that difference?
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.340]   That's purpose number one.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:53.340]   A purpose number two, obviously we have to watch our own lives very carefully.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:15:00.060]   Because although, yes, persecution, threats, it's out there, and it's going to come this
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.140]   way.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.580]   And it may be in here, as in just the community broadly, that someone who claims to be Christian
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.820]   might teach you false things.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.700]   But the heart of the Pharisee could also be where?
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.700]   Right here.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.820]   And I'm going to tell you right now, this sermon was so difficult for me to prepare.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   And just as a heads up, because the passage is in a rebuking tone and Jesus just does
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.180]   a long list of the things that need to be corrected, this sermon is a bit long, okay,
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.180]   everyone?
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.740]   But we're game for it, right?
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.380]   And as you can tell, I am a pastor in the church.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.140]   I'm a leader in the church.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:44.660]   Do I not see the subtleness of the heart of pride?
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.620]   The heart of domineering control?
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.620]   The heart of fake pretense?
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.420]   These things exist.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.060]   You know what's really interesting about this is that the Pharisees originated with good
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.940]   intentions and they were great people.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.980]   Did you know that?
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.380]   Now you might be thinking, "Uh, what do you mean they're great people?"
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.660]   In the human sense, they desired to be experts of the law.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.020]   That's why they're called scribes.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:19.680]   They were the professionals to expound the truth and the Pharisees were called the parousiam
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.780]   or the parousi, which is the set apart ones.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.180]   They were holy for God.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:30.500]   They began with intentions to be dedicated, consecrated for the purpose of God, to serve
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.140]   Him, to lead the people, to be shepherds.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.580]   And in a sense then, they were great.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.660]   They were great people.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:47.340]   But as we know, that agenda and intention, when fueled not by the spirit but by what's
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:54.220]   simply here in the flesh, will always be perverted, will always be exploited.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.540]   And so what I want to show you today is there are three aspects in Jesus' rebuke where they
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.700]   have taken something great and made it so horrendous.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.660]   The Pharisees have gone from greatness to being the worst.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.900]   Originally, I entitled this sermon, "These are the worst people."
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.940]   I just wrote, "Pharisees, the worst people," right?
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.500]   But I recognize there is this interesting pattern where even the good intentions we
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:26.260]   have when met with the sin of pride, pride, it will come out to be the worst product and
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.460]   fruit.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.140]   And so let me move to the very first point of how the Pharisees went from greatness to
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.620]   being the worst.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.380]   And this first point is this.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:43.260]   Point one, they carried the authority of God's Word with no integrity.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:50.500]   God gave them the privilege of not only having and receiving but teaching and expounding
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.140]   the Word of God.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.420]   Let's take a look at this text.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.980]   Verses 1 through 3 says this, "Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples and
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.700]   saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:10.060]   Therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.740]   they say things and do not do them.'"
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.500]   Understand that the Jewish people were hand-selected by God, not because they deserved it but because
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.880]   of his kind intention and he blessed them with his good Word.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:31.820]   Some people think the law, you know, Pharisaical ritualism, away with you, right?
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.500]   Clearly the scripture says the old covenant is done away because the greater glory has
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   come.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.660]   The scripture also says in Romans, "The law was always good."
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.660]   Why?
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.020]   Because it reflected God's character.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.780]   And so the people of God got the privilege, the responsibility, and the greatness to have
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.220]   it and to dispense it.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.900]   And then when he says here that the people have seated themselves in the chair of Moses,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.620]   that represented then the delegated and stewarded authority of God.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.640]   Have you guys ever heard the idea of ex-cathedra?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.420]   In the Catholic faith, they talk about how the Pope speaks ex-cathedra.
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.900]   All it means is out of the chair.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.900]   It's kind of weird, right?
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.060]   But what it's talking about is it comes with the authority that God has given.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.060]   And that's why even nowadays when you say, "Oh, here's the chairman of the board.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.060]   Oh, here's the chairman of that department."
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:28.100]   He is the expert and the authority on that topic in that department.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.580]   That's an immense privilege.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.700]   That's greatness to be given that.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.740]   And that is why Jesus can say, this is really surprising, right?
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.260]   He's about to rebuke them and give them this entire chapter.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.380]   I mean, again, if you look at your Bibles, it's just like, it just goes on, right?
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:51.580]   But he says and gives us commandment, "You are to do and observe all that they tell you."
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.820]   Quick application for all of us.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.980]   How many of you can obey that?
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.460]   What do you mean?
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:04.180]   How many of you can listen to a man you know is an utter hypocrite who has tons of pretense,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.020]   who you know his life is not consistent, but because God has given him or, you know, like
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.300]   a situationally, the authority of the Word of God is coming to you, you have to learn
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   from him.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   Confession.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.100]   It's hard to even learn from somebody just younger than you.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:24.800]   It's very difficult to learn from somebody who is an absolute hypocrite, right?
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.420]   But every single one of us is called to have such a discretion and maturity in this day.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.460]   Why?
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.620]   Because we do not immaturely then just cast out everything.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:41.660]   Whatever is true, good, whatever is in properly interpreted Word of God, it carries so much
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:49.260]   authority, even if it is carried to you by an unworthy vessel, you obey.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.260]   Can you do that?
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.240]   As I thought about this, I was like, "Whoa, that's all strange and weird that that's in
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   there."
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   But I get it.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.840]   The authority of God demands that kind of level of obedience.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   Yes?
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.520]   But let's move to what the point right here was, was we're trying to learn.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   The Pharisees went from greatness to being the worst in the sense that they had this
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.120]   great privilege, but they carried it with no integrity.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   What is meant by that?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.680]   What does it mean to have no integrity?
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.740]   The first element of it is Jesus describes that these individuals had no integrity because
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.460]   they were self-appointed.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.180]   They decided, "I think I have a gift.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180]   You listen to me."
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.500]   Whoa, you just completely bypassed what God has been doing.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   What has God been doing?
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.140]   Hebrews chapter five, verses one through four teaches us that when it comes to the role
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.500]   of leader, when it comes to the role of the priest in the past, God ordained that to be
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.660]   a position where the priest sympathizes with the human being and speaks on behalf of the
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.420]   human.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:59.140]   But this priest has a ridiculously difficult job of making sure that he represents God
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.660]   to the human being.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.780]   So he has this mediary position.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:08.620]   But what he says in verse four is this, "And no one takes this honor to himself, but receives
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.780]   it when he is called by God."
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:19.940]   But today, I believe we are in a dangerous scenario when there is no quality control
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.700]   to say.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.340]   If you look online, I looked it up just for fun.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.940]   You don't have to, there are different leagues of Christianity.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.420]   If you even just Google, "Can I get a master's in divinity online?"
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.940]   You will find there are certain corporations that have online degrees where you can not
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.380]   only get a master's in divinity, as if you could master that, but you could also get
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.860]   a doctorate in divinity, and then you could have it within 30 minutes.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.860]   No joke.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.420]   No joke.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:58.380]   And then it says there, "Gladly serving 20 million people."
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.380]   Mind-blowing, right?
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.140]   But I want you to think about this.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.180]   Unfortunately, we live in a day when, yeah, if a young man says, "I want to go to seminary,"
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.980]   who prevents him?
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.380]   Who guides him?
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.300]   Who says, "Maybe you shouldn't.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.620]   Maybe you have steps to grow."
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.420]   And then if someone says, "I want to be a thought leader, and I'm going to blog away."
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.260]   Someone says, "I'm going to record a sermon."
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.820]   They just record themselves preaching as if they preach with authority.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.580]   Now, I'm not saying all of that is wicked, evil, or bad, but think about how dangerous
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.180]   that could be when there are self-appointed individuals who are saying, "Listen to me,"
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.500]   and presenting it as equally authoritative as this.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.900]   You have to be able to tell the difference.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.620]   But the greater element of the hypocrisy and the lack of integrity comes.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:51.340]   The worse, it gets worse, is because not only do they say these things without the kind
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.420]   of appointment of God, God did not send them, but they say this stuff, but rather they say
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.160]   it, and then they don't do it.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:04.140]   This is the warning that we need to receive.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:13.900]   Our struggle against false pretense, the hypocrisy of, "You say a lot, but you are not."
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.380]   Do we struggle with that?
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.380]   Yes.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.540]   Yes, we do.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.980]   And Scripture says, "This is nothing new in terms of teaching, but you know this.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:29.240]   There is this common false belief that what matters a lot is the way people see me.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.200]   I don't want to look unspiritual, undisciplined.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.520]   I don't want to look stupid, uninformed, ignorant, whatever it may be.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.600]   And therefore, there is regularly a temptation.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.840]   I may not project myself like I am the leader of leaders, but I just at least want to project
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.760]   myself a little better than I am."
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.160]   An interesting part of that to me, and you may disagree with me here, but I saw a weird
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.040]   pattern in Christendom over the last 10 years.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.600]   There were people I saw, they were just struggling with their faith.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.720]   They felt guilty about their faith.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.280]   And then there came this movement where they were just like, "You know what it is?
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:15.600]   We have to have a vibrant relationship with Jesus because Christianity is not a religion,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.240]   it's a relationship."
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.160]   I love that tagline because that's true.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.080]   You guys have heard from this pulpit, you need to abide and walk with Jesus because
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.480]   you can know facts, you can intellectually have stuff memorized, and you can say the
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.800]   right things, but if daily you're not abiding in Christ, you are far and low, right?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.560]   But there's this question.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.720]   You can have a slogan like, "It's a relationship but not a religion," but now we have to ask
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.200]   the question, "So did you build a vibrant relationship?"
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:54.480]   Did you start making sure that you're communicating with Jesus and you have such a relationship
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.600]   that when you needed comfort, you went to Him and you received His comfort and you felt
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   blessed?
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.120]   When you needed forgiveness, you repented, asked Him for forgiveness, and you were blessed
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.960]   by His grace and mercies to wash you.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.040]   When you needed instruction, you went to Him and then you...
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.920]   Was that the fruit?
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.800]   You know what happened over time is that wasn't the fruit.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.240]   You had people who just continued to feel guilty and then the gospel-centered movement
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.000]   came along and they said, "You know what?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.160]   We have to just be gospel-centered."
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.560]   And there was this another slogan, it's like, "Gospel-centered this and gospel-centered
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   that."
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.840]   Is that true and correct?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   Yes.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.760]   Of course we have to be gospel-centered.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.040]   The gospel is the message of salvation.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:42.600]   It is the kindness of God that has appeared to our generation to hear the message of Christ.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.680]   But it became a slogan, which now we have to ask the question, "So then did you get
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   gospel-centered?
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.860]   Were you dedicated your life to preach this gospel to your friends, to your family?
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.760]   You dedicated your life to live in the power of that forgiveness?"
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.720]   What am I trying to say?
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.480]   Pharisaical hypocrisy is not, "You need to be righteous," because Jesus said, "Blessed
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.560]   are those who thirst for righteousness."
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.120]   Pharisaical hypocrisy is when you say all this stuff, but there is actually no fruit
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.280]   in you.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.440]   Even the good slogans you say, now obviously you can tell I am against slogan Christianity
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.000]   because you tend to boil down what is supposed to be a vibrant, dynamic walk with your Father
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.840]   into some kind of slogan phrase, which typically means you've already bought into the idea
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.360]   that that's going to somehow make you spiritual.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.900]   It hasn't borne its fruit.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   You can say the best slogans, but if you say and you are not, then the heart of Pharisee
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.500]   is already in you.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:56.520]   Even the good things we say, even the proper things we say, could cause you to have a Pharisaical
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.880]   heart.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:07.640]   True spirituality will not rely on what you say, but with integrity, you desire to model.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   You desire to be.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.480]   You look to the insides and you desire to bear fruit.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   This is a challenge.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.840]   I wrote to myself little notes because, again, in this passage, Jesus turns to the crowds
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.320]   and warns them, "Don't follow these guys."
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.760]   Then he points at them and says, "You!
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.320]   Woe to you!"
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.280]   I wrote notes when I was studying to myself, "Mark, as hard as it is to say, 'You need
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.760]   to be in every way an example to this church.'"
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.360]   Now, that's like a weird thing to say, right?
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.200]   But that's what the Scripture says.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   Be diligent to present yourself when approved of God.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.920]   Don't let people discredit you for your youthfulness, but you be a model to the church.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   What a high calling.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.200]   God is not settling for less.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.400]   Point number two.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.960]   Point number two.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.320]   The reason why the Pharisees went from greatness to being the worst is also because, although
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:13.640]   they were to be shepherds of the flock, instead they selfishly exploited the people.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.160]   What we see from Jesus' rebuke is not only that, look, you speak with authority, but
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.500]   you don't do hypocrisy.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:27.380]   He says now, "You were supposed to shepherd these people, but you bound them like cattle.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.400]   You burdened them like mules."
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.920]   This is exactly what he was saying.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   Take a look at verse four.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.720]   So we're on chapter 23, verse four.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:44.840]   "They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.600]   to move them with so much as a finger."
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.040]   You think about that.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:30:00.120]   And again, God had called various shepherds within that era to lead the people to life
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.880]   giving waters of the word, to be ready and prepared to receive the Messiah so that they
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.360]   would have life.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.320]   That's what they were supposed to do.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   But instead, they gathered more rules and laws, maybe in a false intention of trying
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.560]   to make these things pure and non-compromised, and they started attaching all these rules
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   and regulations.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:29.680]   And you've heard there's over 50 volumes of additional laws, burdens, the things you
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.200]   can't and have to do.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.960]   And Jesus says and rebukes them, "Look at what you've done.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.520]   The people you're supposed to shepherd, you've burdened."
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:48.560]   Now as I was praying and thinking about that, I was like, I guess part of me was thinking,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.680]   "Are the Pharisees just like horrendous, wicked, wicked people, or what happened?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.760]   Were they just trying to protect the law and that's why it went that way?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.300]   Why in the world do we do this kind of stuff?"
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:08.200]   And as I reflected, I recognized this is coming back to the heart of the human flesh.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.520]   This is nothing new to you, but this is a meditation on the fact that every single one
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   of us, why would any of us do the same, where we would burden other people, command, but
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.760]   not want to lift a finger to help them?
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.560]   Why would we take that responsibility of shepherding, but instead turned it around and domineer?
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:36.320]   And it's because every single one of us has a spirit of royalty in here.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.960]   Can I prove it to you guys?
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:45.120]   The moment you come out and you're able to speak, you command people, even your parents.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.660]   Later on, that comes exhibited in your brotherhood, like within the siblings.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.080]   And then later on, this voice comes out of your mind that says, "Why didn't you do what
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   I said?"
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.680]   It comes out sometimes in my parenting.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.480]   There is this little spirit of royalty in our hearts that expects other individuals
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.800]   to carry my load and burden.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:16.080]   And God said in the Old Testament, "When you establish a ruler, if you have a king over
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.400]   you, do you understand what this king is going to do?
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.960]   He's going to do the very thing every single one of you want to do."
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.520]   You'll impose your laws, you'll impose your regulations, you're going to expect the people
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.040]   to work, and then you're going to exploit those people so that you can satisfy your
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.200]   own flesh.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.280]   That is the heart that we see in modern day politics.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.320]   That is the heart that you see in the home.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.440]   That is the heart you see sometimes in conflict.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.920]   You see it everywhere.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.360]   Take a look at this, Ezekiel 34.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.040]   In Ezekiel 34, verses one through six, "The word of the Lord came to me saying, 'Son of
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.600]   man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.880]   Prophesy and say to those shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Woe, shepherds of Israel,
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.960]   who have been feeding themselves."'
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.120]   Should not the shepherds feed the flock?
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.440]   You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.880]   You slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock."
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Look at this.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.480]   "Those who are sickly, you have not strengthened, and diseased, you have not healed.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.840]   The broken you have not bound up, and the scattered you have not brought back, nor have
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:25.640]   you sought the lost, but with force and with severity you have dominated them."
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.380]   When there is pride in our hearts, we lack sympathy.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.680]   When there is pride in our hearts, we lack mercy.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.200]   When there is pride in our hearts, rather than seeing individuals as those whom God
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.640]   has entrusted us to care for and to bring them along with great grace, we see them as
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.080]   mules to carry our responsibilities."
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:55.360]   This is how the Pharisees went from great to being the worst.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:03.000]   Interestingly enough, the community at Stanford University did a psychological study and experiment.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.640]   It's called the Prison Experiment.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   It's very controversial.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.240]   They essentially put a bunch of people in the prison and then said, "I want to give
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.880]   you some rules, and then I'm going to give you roles.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.240]   You guys here, you're going to be prison guards, okay?
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.240]   You do have the authority."
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.000]   There was this button they pushed.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.040]   It was minor corporal punishment.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.960]   And then on this side, "You guys are the prisoners, okay?"
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.600]   I don't know who signed up for that, right?
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.720]   It's like, "That sounds good to me."
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.240]   And they did the experiment, okay?
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.520]   And they made a documentary out of it, too, but it was very controversial.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.960]   You can imagine, right?
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.840]   You can imagine how controversial that may be.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.160]   What do you think happened?
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.040]   The people who assumed the role of authority, all of a sudden they realized, "We need
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   more laws."
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.000]   So they started making rules.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.440]   "You better listen to us the moment we da-da-da-da-da.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   You're not allowed to walk there.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   We need to keep you in line."
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.160]   And next thing you know, they assumed the authority of power, and they listed ... I
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.960]   forget exactly how many more rules they implemented into the prison than that was already given.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.640]   And then they used it.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.440]   They used the button.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.920]   But they were just volunteers.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.520]   I'm not saying to use that and say, "Oh my goodness, da-da-da-da-da."
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   But every single one of us has within us a desire for control.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:34.280]   Every single one of us has within us a desire and potentially a temptation to enact my way.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.240]   But scripture tells us good leaders are not so.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.600]   This is why I wrote to myself, "Good leaders are not so."
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.640]   You never sought to have dominance.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.560]   You never actually sought the leadership.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.480]   What you sought to be was trustworthy.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.640]   Good leaders, brothers and sisters, and you need to tell the difference.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.120]   When you give your ear to those who are giving you sermons, when you give your ear to those
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.000]   who are trying to teach and guide your thought, those individuals are not trying to be thought
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   leaders.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.720]   They're trying to be good and trustworthy, dependable servants.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:16.200]   And when they earn that trust, they're guiding you to God.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.360]   And what you see sometimes is scripture gives this exhortation, 1 Peter 5, verse 1 through
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.760]   3, "Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.480]   sufferings of Christ and a partaker also of the glory that is revealed, shepherd the flock
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.600]   of God among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, voluntarily, according to
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:43.600]   the will of God, not for sordid gain, with eagerness, nor yet as lording it over those
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.560]   allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock."
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.880]   That is such an immense exhortation.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.320]   That is such an immense exhortation.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:02.400]   Now I reflected more on this idea.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.800]   What in your mind gives you permission to command all these people, "You better do it,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.000]   you better do it," and then you don't lift a finger?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.320]   And again, I come to the conclusion, you must have thought that you were royalty.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:21.280]   But I reflected a little bit more, and I recognized also that within modern day society, what
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:29.040]   I see a lot are individuals who see the church and this Christian body in the complete wrong
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   worldview.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.320]   What am I talking about?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:38.040]   I see people look at the church as an organization, as a business, as a program, as an institution
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.400]   that needs consultants to make it better.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.760]   And why is that wrong?
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.600]   Because sometimes I see people comment about the church, the church needs X, Y, and Z,
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.280]   and more in order for it to be successful.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.120]   But that is the wrong way of thinking about it.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   Why?
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.640]   Because the church was already given a framework of what it was supposed to be in terms of
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.240]   its identity and entity before the Lord.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.360]   In relationship to God, the primary depiction, the primary picture is number one, the bride,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.760]   and number two, the house.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   Yes?
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.560]   So what am I trying to say?
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.320]   Let me give you this exhortation.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.920]   For us to combat this arrogance and pride of the spirit of loyalty, you have to see
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:29.520]   this church as a spiritual household of God of which the Father is very protective of
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.960]   His house.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.880]   What we need in the church is not more commentators.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.900]   We do not need consultants.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.200]   We need fathers and mothers who are willing to go alongside people.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.820]   We need fathers and mothers who are willing to get dirty and change some diapers.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.220]   We need older brothers and sisters who are willing to take younger brothers and sisters
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.900]   by the hand and walk the dangerous streets.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:55.600]   We need aunties and uncles who are willing to give life-giving advice in the milestones
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.180]   of people's lives, of their little nephews and nieces, there for the graduation, there
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.060]   for their first job, there for their first kid, giving life advice from the Scriptures.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   Amen?
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.180]   We don't need more commentators saying, "Y'all got to better do this to make your church better."
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:15.620]   We've had enough of that.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:22.580]   The church is a household of God that requires people to see that kind of harmony and unity
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.580]   within.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:32.620]   So, I wrote to myself, "Mark, do not ever just commentate on God's family, for when
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:37.260]   you do, you place yourself above it."
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.900]   I got to be careful of my words.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.820]   As a pastor, I talk a lot.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:48.500]   You know, and the Scripture says in Proverbs, "Lots of words, lot of sin."
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.020]   There is something fleshly in me, yes, that takes joy in just judging things and criticizing
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.980]   things, and I need to repent of that.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:02.540]   And I need to remember this is the household of God of which we are all children, of whom
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.300]   God is very protective of.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.860]   I can't come in like that, thinking I'm above this.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.300]   And therefore, if ever I give commands but I'm not willing to lift a finger, shame on
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   me.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.860]   I saw it the wrong way, right?
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.900]   I need to be in the thick of the work of edifying and building this church, and that's why you
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.260]   guys know our church takes church membership very seriously, because it is appropriate,
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.700]   right and good.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.700]   Amen?
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   Next, point number three, the Pharisees went from greatness to the worst, because they
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.140]   used God's given trumpets to please men rather than God, right?
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.220]   They used the God-given trumpets.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:53.340]   When I say trumpets, these are signs and signals, signals, okay, to get everybody's attention,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.740]   to make sure that we know like this indicates something.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.740]   Rather than using it for the glory of God, rather than using for its purposes, they use
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.100]   it to please men and themselves.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.140]   And the scripture says, Jesus says this to them, "But they do all their deeds to be noticed
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.240]   by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.800]   They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogue and respectful
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.780]   greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by men."
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.420]   Yikes.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.740]   Jesus does more than correct.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.340]   You're not teaching correctly.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.340]   A Bible passage doesn't say that.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.140]   Jesus does so much more than that.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.740]   He pierces through their heart.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.060]   You love attention.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.100]   You love honor.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.020]   You love their praise.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   You love their esteem.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.380]   Wow.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.260]   Now, we're not Jesus.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.100]   We can't look at a person and be like, "I know what's in your heart, you're Pharisee."
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.220]   So please don't go around doing that stuff.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:03.660]   But Jesus cuts through to the core and says, "You love these, the glory of man more than
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.380]   the glory of God."
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:11.420]   And by their love for the attention, they love it when people notice them.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.020]   They look like fools.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.860]   I want you to just imagine with me walking around.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.340]   I actually pulled up a picture, but right now there's like this part of me, I was like,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.300]   I don't want to, let me just say this, okay?
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.740]   I didn't want to just make fun of Jewish people, okay?
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.460]   It's not a Jewish problem.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.380]   The heart of pride is every single one of us human problem.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.980]   But when you look up the photos, you have these individuals who are walking around with
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.020]   straight up box tied to their head.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:47.740]   You know in Deuteronomy, it says that you shall impress these words on your heart and
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:53.740]   your soul, so you shall bind them as signs on your hand, on the frontals of your forehead
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.620]   and your doorpost, right?
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.380]   So if you look up a picture of a Jewish individual and you look up phylacteries, they have more
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.780]   than just this box.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.980]   They have this leather box right here that has miniature scrolls, but they also have
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.540]   a leather band with the scriptures around their wrist and they wrap it around their
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.740]   middle finger, around their arm and they look like ninjas, okay?
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.260]   And then they have these garments where they have blue cords running down and in order
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.620]   to make them bigger, they made them longer.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:24.820]   And in order to show off, look how much I know, look how devout and look how significant
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.900]   I am.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.460]   They made it bigger and bigger and the rabbis had to make rules.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.620]   You could only have it so big, man.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.000]   They limited it, okay?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.700]   Think about for us in our generation, how foolish we have become wanting attention.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:45.620]   I went to the zoo with my family and there was this young girl with this long stick and
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:51.700]   her camera and she's doing the whole, again, if currently this is your job and I'm making
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.060]   you feel guilty, I apologize, okay?
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.060]   But I was flabbergasted.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.180]   She was walking around and everything she did, "Look guys, I'm looking at the polar
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.180]   bears," you know?
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.180]   "Look, got it?"
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.340]   And then it's so funny because the zoo, you've got this path, so she just happened to be
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.540]   in front of us in everything we did and the whole time I was just so bothered.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.500]   "Look guys, I'm on the sky tram," you know?
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:19.580]   "I'm eating cotton candy," like, oh my God, right?
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.140]   And if you've ever done the thing, it's like, "Look guys, I'm reading my Bible at the coffee
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.580]   shop with the light coming in, the soft light," it's like.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   Now I get it.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.780]   It's like maybe you in your heart of hearts wanted to just inspire some people to do devotions,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   okay?
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.060]   Maybe that was your intent.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.580]   But we live in a generation where it's like, "Do it for the gram."
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   But do you have any idea how biblical that is when literally Jesus said, "I want you
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:52.860]   to do what you do in the privacy of your own closet with God because I don't want you to
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:59.260]   just have this reward and have nothing from God."
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:05.900]   Do you, the Phariseeism is you live for the praise and reward of this world and your judgment
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.340]   is going to be you have nothing from God.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:16.620]   And so as a warning to us, as a warning, the trumpet that God gave, now realize this, it
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.900]   is immature to think, "Forget it then.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.620]   I'm just going to hide my Bible.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.660]   I'm not even going to take photos of it.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.180]   No one's going to see me pray.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.500]   I'm not going to raise my hands and worship."
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.780]   That's immaturity too.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.660]   You're still afraid of the same thing, right?
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.740]   You still care about the exact same thing.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:45.140]   The problem is we loved it and then there are people who fear it and it's the same thing.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.060]   Let me give you an example.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:53.060]   Obviously we had a generation of people who loved self-esteem.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:57.420]   So they loved it when their parents were like, "You're going to be a leader."
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.380]   They took SAT class and like, "Oh my gosh, you're going to excel.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.660]   You for sure Ivy League."
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.660]   And I grew up in that generation where everybody was just like, like everything I read was,
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.180]   you got to be a leader.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.740]   And then people cared so much about your self-esteem, they wanted to build you up.
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.980]   What was the fruit of that?
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.580]   The fruit of that was depression.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.540]   I can't take the pressure, right?
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.980]   My parents think like, "It's A plus or bust, right?
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.780]   I can't do this."
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.500]   It resulted in the fruit of anxiety.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:38.100]   But then now the response also, I don't think they've learned.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:44.340]   Your love for leadership, your love for self-esteem had with it the desire to hear, "You're going
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.420]   to be great."
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.140]   That same desire is embedded in this culture that magnifies pain.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.300]   You have no idea how much I suffer.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.100]   Oh my gosh, you don't know the pain I've been through.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:03.340]   Now what I say, I say with a caveat, there are people who have been in legitimate deep
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:07.340]   pain and God says, "I am your comfort.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.060]   I am your sufficient supply."
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:14.500]   But the reason why I call this out is because the fruit of this, this that I see has not
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.300]   been, "Lord, you're my comfort."
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.140]   The fruit of this has been, "You guys need to talk to me.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.140]   Don't silence me.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   Hear me roar."
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.140]   That is the same thing.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.060]   You're still looking for the platitude of, "You're okay.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.180]   You're significant.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.020]   You matter to us."
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.020]   What is that?
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.900]   Whether you call it self-esteem or this, it's the same thing.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.620]   And in that picture, when I counsel people and they tell me their problems, I draw it
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.940]   on a map and I ask them, "Show me where God is.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:52.380]   In your pursuit of fixing your problems, and yes, you may have the deepest pains that I
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.660]   cannot relate with.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.060]   Show me where is God."
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.260]   There is no glory of God in that picture.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:06.360]   And that's where we are the weakest, amen?
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:12.660]   For us as Christians, our lowest point is when we do not see the glory of God.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.020]   And therefore, I challenge you this day.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.820]   The exhortation is, I want you to be great.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:25.020]   But there is a complete different path for you than what the Pharisees took.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:30.860]   There is an immensely different path for us to have greatness, to own greatness, and to
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.820]   actually not project greatness, but be great.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.700]   And Jesus says it here.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.940]   Point four, be the greatest.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.140]   How?
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.500]   Verse eight, "Don't be called rabbi.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   For one is your teacher and you are all brothers.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:54.220]   Do not call anyone on earth your father, for one is your father, he who is in heaven.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:59.020]   Do not be called leaders, for one is your leader, that is Christ.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.780]   But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:11.260]   Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.860]   Let's first take a look at what Jesus says in verse eight through ten.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.860]   "Don't be called rabbi.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.620]   Don't call anyone your father, and do not be called leaders yourselves."
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.820]   I guess I'm insane, right?
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.060]   I guess our church leaders, we're just egotistical, right?
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.340]   Because I walk around and say, "Elder James, Elder Philip, Elder Joe," and I give them
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.260]   tons of respect because I trust them.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.500]   And people call me Pastor Mark.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:49.220]   Question, am I going against the direct teaching of my Lord here?
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:55.340]   What we see is he does this thing where he says, "I don't want you to seek the title
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.340]   like they do.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.220]   Don't look for yourself to be called rabbi.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.700]   But also you don't call other people father."
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.780]   And he's talking about the heart's endeavor.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.120]   What is it you want through these things?
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.260]   What is it that you want when people call you rabbi?
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.540]   It's really, really clear.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:20.180]   We love being seen as the one who knows.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.220]   Your intellectual clout, that is so tempting.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.900]   But for us as Christian, what is the solution so that you do not arrogantly follow this
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:38.620]   temptation to be deemed the chair of the board of the theology department?
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:45.240]   There is a singular, unique, perfect knowledge you can have, and that is our Savior Jesus
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.600]   Christ, amen?
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   He to us is the perfection of wisdom.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.360]   He to us is the embodiment of knowledge.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:58.560]   And for me to know Christ and to be known by him is the solve-all.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.560]   That's the end of our things.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:07.780]   I could be foolish, ignorant, not only not an expert, but completely deficient in my
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   know-how.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:15.760]   But to know Christ and him crucified, that's my ambition, amen?
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.140]   There is your solution to this rat race.
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.340]   And so what he says is what's the emphasis of this passage is not that no longer should
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:29.020]   we ever call anybody a leader because the rest of the New Testament teaches us you establish
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:34.020]   elders at the church, you establish those who are going to rule well, and those of you
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.380]   who are young, remember the passage that I read in 1 Peter, you need to submit to your
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.380]   leaders.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:46.060]   But what he says is you need to understand that there is one teacher, one father, one
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.580]   leader.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:56.860]   Your desire for protection, all of you who long for security, all of you who long for
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:04.420]   affirmation by somebody who has the authority to affirm you, can I tell you, you have one
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.420]   father.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:13.820]   And we sang, I came back to that song, holy, there is no one like him.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.900]   What I recognize is there is one master.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.340]   Do not look for other leaders.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.340]   Why?
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.900]   Because even as I teach, I have a Lord over me.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.140]   Even as I teach, I have an authority above me.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.900]   And the greatest thing for you to understand is that I have no authority.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.460]   That makes my life so much easier.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.360]   I have no authority on myself.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.140]   But the crazy thing about this and the paradoxical thing about this is I have greater authority
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.560]   than a hundred men.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   How can that be?
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.700]   You have no authority, but you have greater authority than a panel of experts.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.380]   Why?
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.420]   Because we have one.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:57.380]   His one singular authoritative word and his one great presence over my life makes my job
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.500]   absolutely simple.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.620]   Difficult but simple.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:06.300]   So long as I tie you to the voice of God, this ministry will succeed.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.300]   Guys, I'm going to just confess to you, in this generation, part of the reason I felt
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:15.220]   the need to preach this is because I'm worried.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.460]   I see all kinds of trash out there.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:23.100]   And right now, what I see is a progression of false thought, reaction to false thought,
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.780]   and human solutions to spiritual problems.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.180]   And then you have a muck.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.700]   You have muddiness in the Christian world.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.760]   You have people elevating things that should not be elevated.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:40.220]   You have people in the name of authenticity elevate doubt, elevate this whole deconstruction
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.220]   thing.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.660]   Makes it beautiful.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.740]   Let me just comment on that for a brief second.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   It is not beautiful.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.740]   Why?
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.300]   Because we're not elevated of the glory of God.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:54:00.140]   When we're so concerned about my path, my process, that I don't care whether God is
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:06.500]   questioned, where I'm not considerate of whether my God is being put through the ringer, and
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:12.860]   I glorify and make beautiful that which is questioning God, we're elevating the wrong
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   thing.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:20.620]   But right now in our day, that feels pretty authentic and real.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.220]   I'm very worried.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:30.920]   But this passage to me, there is a path for us to greatness and security.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.980]   There is a way for us to be in the will of God, which is to understand and be under this
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:41.180]   one singular authoritative final source, amen?
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:44.940]   And for us, then the challenge is going to be, I need to make sure that I am seeking
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.700]   the glory of this one God.
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   I repeat for you a passage that I read earlier, John chapter 5, verse 44.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:57.260]   Jesus asked this question, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:02.300]   you do not seek the glory that which is from the one and only God?"
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:08.220]   The question there is, how can you have faith?
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:15.700]   If your heart is longing for the affirmation of people, you have an adulterous love relationship
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:20.660]   that cannot allow you to have intimacy with God.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:27.900]   And that is at the core of the pride, selfishness, and the erroneous way of the Pharisee.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.340]   That's what we need to fight.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:35.500]   But the second thing what he said was that in order to seek greatness, that the greatest
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:42.140]   among you shall be your servant, whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.060]   himself shall be exalted.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:47.860]   So underneath this point, if principle one, you needed to recognize that there is one
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:53.980]   teacher, one father, one leader over you, and we have him who is the solution to all,
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:56:00.940]   your path to humility is to recognize that your responsibility is actually to humble
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:08.820]   yourself, then entrust your entire life to God who will establish you.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.300]   Amen?
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:16.420]   For us, there is a paradoxical way to greatness.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:21.580]   Your goal is going to desire and dedicate yourself to be that soldier of Christ.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:29.980]   I have a great cause, I have a great commander, and my job is to serve that goal.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.580]   You have a desire, a dedication in your heart.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:38.500]   This is my home, my family, and my job is to be a great family member, a great brother
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:44.420]   and sister, father or mother, older brother, auntie, grandpa, whatever you may be, I am
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:48.700]   a member of this house.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.740]   To be a dependable servant is to us our great path.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:59.380]   And when God, the master of all, the teacher of all, and the father of the house says to
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:10.660]   you, "Good job, my servant," that to us is going to be greatness and glory, nothing else.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:17.460]   Every other, like, accolade, fame is going to be nothing compared to that, amen?
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:23.980]   I will leave you with this final passage from 1 Peter 5, verse 4 through 10.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:30.260]   In the context of Apostle Peter warning against false teachers, he says, "And when the chief
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:37.340]   shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340]   That's it.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:43.260]   "You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders, and all of you clothe yourselves
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.460]   with humility towards one another.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.260]   For God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:55.620]   Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you at the
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:58:01.980]   proper time, casting all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you."
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.740]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:12.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
