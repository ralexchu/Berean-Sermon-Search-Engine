[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   why we are seeking to dwell upon the suffering

[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   the grace that you have shown us,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   and how you've redeemed these stony hearts
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   into hearts of flesh.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   Lord, I pray that with this change
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   that we would live faithfully

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   on top of just step-by-step walking with our Lord
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   on the way to Good Friday
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   and the subsequent Resurrection Sunday
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   is that we get to listen to some of the testimonies
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   of our very own brothers and sisters in our church.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.000]   It's so sweet to be able to hear
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   what they're going through,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   what they're learning.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And so tonight,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   just like we have the last couple nights,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   we have the privilege of hearing one of our sisters speak
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   of just what God has been doing in her life,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   how God saved her,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   some of the things that the God that she serves
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   has shed light into her.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   And we call it a testimony,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   that it's not just a story about a person,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   but how Holly is going to be pointing to God.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.000]   So tonight, as we welcome Holly up,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   would you give her a big hand?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   [applause]
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Good evening, church family.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   My name is Holly Gao,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and this is my testimony.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I was born and raised
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   in a non-believing family in Beijing, China.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And like many Chinese kids from my generation,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I was the only child,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   and also I didn't have many friends growing up.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.000]   My parents loved me deeply
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   and were trying to provide the best for me in their ways.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I remember my mom being often busy with work
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and my dad taking me around
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   to visit different interesting sites,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   but not communicating with me much
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   with what I was going through.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   As life went on and different challenges appeared,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   I struggled with the constant feeling
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   of rejection and exclusion.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   When some kids bullied me in elementary school,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.000]   when an in-law called me ugly in multiple occasions,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   or when my parents started arguing,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I didn't know what to do or think,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   so I clung on to my cute dogs
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   that were always there for me,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   TV dramas, online relationships, and games,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and just moved on with my feelings.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Though doing decent academically,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I was already a rebellious,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   stubborn, hard-outside-but-scared-inside kind of kid.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.000]   To give you an example,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I even ran away from home twice in elementary school.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   My mom knew it all, though,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   because I stacked up my backpack
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   with all my money, snacks, and stickers.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   She knew exactly I would go to a shop in our community,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   spend all my money, and come back.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So she just watched me.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   When I graduated middle school,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   my disobedience leveled up, though.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I started taking care of my appearance
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and tasting the fun of being liked in high school.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.000]   That desperate need to feel accepted
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   drove me to dating,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   which was considered early dating
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and often forbidden by many schools in Beijing,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   sometimes with the consequence of expulsion.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Of course, I was self-centered
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and only did what I wanted, what I cared,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   the care and attention of people.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   My pride and fulfillment were in the ability
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   to get the guys to like and care for me
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   for my convenience and my comfort
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.000]   without even really caring about them.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Some of them I even despised in my heart.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I had no care nor shame for what other students
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   or teachers thought of me,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   even my parents when they found out
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   about my deviant relationships.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I thought I was living my best life,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   having decent grades,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   hanging out with my group of friends,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   preparing for going on a high school exchange to Denmark,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   discovering dating and different cultures.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.000]   It felt like as if nobody was able
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   to constrain me from getting what I wanted.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   However, none of those good things fulfilled my heart
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   but left me feeling empty and broken inside.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   God was so good to me that such a rebellious kid like me
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   who could have fallen far, far away
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   met the holy, holy, holy God.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   After coming back from Denmark,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   my best friend invited me out to her home church in 2014.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I remember clearly how those kids,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.000]   similarly in age, had such a genuine care
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and love for one another that I'd never seen before,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   not like my high school dramas.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That love overwhelmed me,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and because it felt like Eden,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   a hiding place for me, I kept going back,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   even though I slept through most of the teachings,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   which had its consequences later on,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   so don't imitate me.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I didn't doubt the gospel,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   but I didn't think it was relevant to me either.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.000]   I met Berean's China mission team
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   through their English camp,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and the sisters on the team kept in touch with me.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   It was until the day of my "sprinkling" baptism
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   that I got saved on Easter Sunday in 2015.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I heard the song that we sing
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   by the end of every Sunday service,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "Because He Lives."
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Because I know he holds the future,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   and life is worth the living
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.000]   just because he lives.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   As I heard the choir song these lines in Mandarin,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   my tears just fell out.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I felt for the first time in my life
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   that there was a sense of hope.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Wow, there is a meaning and a hope to life.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   From then on,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   where I found satisfaction started to change.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   The girl who could never get up on time for anything,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   literally, started waking up at 7 a.m.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   to take the subway for an hour to go to church.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Even when her mom stopped her multiple times
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.000]   because of the waste of time,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   and even she saw the change.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   The girl who held on to being loved and taken care of
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   broke up her four-year-long secular relationship
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   because she didn't want to sin anymore
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and disobey God.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Rather than pleasing men and myself,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   my heart started going after God's desire.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   The sins that used to bring me excitement and happiness
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   now sadden me like a dark cloud
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   or a heavy stone over my heart.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Though my faith was very small and weak,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.000]   God gave me the grace to simply follow what I knew of him.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   God always has his sovereign perfect timing.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   My rapid growth happened
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   when I started to understand what a holy God he is
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   and how desperately I and everyone need him
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   as we are all sinners.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   In fall of 2015,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I moved to Sweden for college
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   and started going to a very liberal church
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   that only talked about God's love
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   without talking about his sin--
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.000]   sorry, without mentioning anything about his holiness
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and us to be holy.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Two years in, though I was busy
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   with all kinds of religious activities,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I felt more distant from knowing who God was.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Then I met a sister who came from China
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and she shared a series on God's holiness
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   from Paul Washer.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   In Isaiah 6-6, the angels were worshiping the Lord,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.000]   It was a picture of how heavenly creatures like angels
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   worship God blow my mind away.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And it brought me to a speechless, indeed,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   moment of awe, bringing me to my knees to worship.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   God revealed his holiness to me
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and showed me the depths of my past and current sins
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   of living my life for myself rather than for God.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The two of us sisters started praying and fasting
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   to turn away from our sins and turn to Jesus,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.000]   reading the Bible, singing praises,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and sharing the good news with people.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Every day, I look forward to meeting
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   and getting to know my almighty Father and Savior
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   more through looking for more than anything,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   through reading his words and praying to him.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   My heart that always longed for love
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   but yet was never fulfilled through human relationships
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   was now filled with the enjoyment of his infinite love
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   and his grace and mercy over a sinner like me.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.000]   Romans 5a says, "But God demonstrates
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   "his own love towards us in that while we were yet sinners,"
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   in other words, enemies of God, "Christ died for us."
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   That hope that I received earlier on
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   is now made clear to me,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   an everlasting life living for and through Jesus,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   who died on the cross and paid for all of my sins.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   For the first time in my life,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   alone time didn't mean loneliness anymore,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   but consecrated time with God.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.000]   Now filled with--
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   not filled with fear and helplessness,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   but with peace, hope, and joy
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   that never experienced before.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Yet, the Christian faith is not a fairy tale
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   with a man-made getting-everything-you-want
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   kind of happy ending.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's far better than that.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   In the following year of 2020,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   my best friend from Sunday school
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   died at the age of 20 suddenly.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   He was the only child of his family,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   had just been admitted to Northeastern University,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.000]   and had a bright future in front of him.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Rather than complaining to God about this great loss,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   knowing his Lordship made me trust his sovereignty
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and focus on praying for his parents.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Then the news came that his father miraculously
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   came to faith the day he died
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and even started to encourage and comfort his mom.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Together, his parents even wrote on his gravestone,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "To be with Christ is far better,"
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   from Philippians 1:23.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   What a joy to witness his amazing grace in salvation.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.920]   Out of the urgency after realizing
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   how short our lives could be,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   I started sharing the gospel
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.920]   with literally everyone I knew and encountered,
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   only to find out that most of my friends
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   in Sweden and Denmark
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   were cultural Christians
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   who had no knowledge of the Bible
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   and thought everyone could just go to heaven.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   I had no fear in my heart to share the gospel,
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   but only the fear that they were not saved
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   from the curse of sin,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   feeling broken over their sins
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   and ignorance of our magnificent God.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.920]   During my college years in Sweden,
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Pastor Alex and his family moved to Beijing.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   They now live in Taiwan.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   They moved there for long-term missions,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   so I also kept visiting Alex's Bible studies
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   every time I went back to visit my parents.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   After being reviewed to the truth in 2017,
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.920]   I saw how his and Berean's teachings
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   were as clear and bold as the Bible teaches.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   Therefore, in the two years of hopping around
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   not having a solitary to go to in southern Sweden,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.920]   God used Berean and Pastor Alex's family
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   to nourish my soul and guide me through thick and thin.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   Having a solitary family that worships God
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   in spirit and truth is a huge blessing
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   that not everyone around the world has.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   Upon meeting Christ,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   the heart change is always miraculous
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   and often unexplainable,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   and I'll briefly share two areas
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   where he changed me after college.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   First, God replaced my entitlement
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   of having whatever I wanted
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   whenever I wanted to seeing my parents sacrifice for me,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.920]   choosing to love them over my pride,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   to be quick to seek forgiveness and to forgive
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   because I was forgiven much through Jesus' blood.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   I'm very thankful that I now have
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   a much better relationship with my parents,
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   and I've seen even changes from their side,
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   though they still not yet know Christ.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   Second, in recent years, God taught me
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   to trust that he is indeed sovereign and good.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   Through different seasons of transitions
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   back and forth between China and Sweden
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   and now a few years in the U.S.,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.920]   I see how he graciously used his words
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   to change my heart.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   The more he reviewed his word,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   which is the way, the truth, and the life,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   the more it grew me in love and desire to glorify him.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   In a life, decisions of choosing a career path
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   and where to live, glorifying God was a priority.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   I was convicted of the possibility
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   of international missions
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   and therefore went into the teaching profession,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   which I actually disliked growing up,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   for the flexibility to move.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.920]   I also chose to study at USC to come to Berlin,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   contrasting how I went to Sweden for college
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   to be closer to my then boyfriend
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   and enjoying a life away from my parents.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   In all these, it was his grace and mercy
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   to show me what's truly the best.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   And he kept humbling me to let go of my control
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   and know that he is God.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   Upon graduating college,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   I moved to another city in Sweden
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   to attend a more reformed church
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   where I started planning a future
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   with a ministry and a relationship ahead.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.920]   However, I was too blinded by my desire
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   and my plan to see that our major theological beliefs
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   about Genesis and creation could not be compromised.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   I realized very late in the process
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   that it wasn't the right time,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   the right church, nor the right relationship
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   for me to commit to.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   In confusion, I questioned God's goodness
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   in providing me two very good pathways
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   but all gone at once.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   Staying in Sweden where my heart grew for ministry
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.920]   and the soil was being prepared
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   and coming to the U.S. for Berean and graduate school.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   In my desperation to seek the next step,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   Pastor Alex simply said,
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   "Jesus is not the way to answers.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   "He is the answer."
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   This simple but yet profound truth struck me
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   and brought me to peace to seek him alone
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   and trust God who holds the future.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   Looking back, I couldn't be more thankful
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   for his plan that's far beyond my understanding.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   Exposing and using my weakness
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.920]   to sanctify me and accomplish his plan.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   After all this, I can confidently pray
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   for him to send me wherever he pleases
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   at his timing.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   And though challenges will arise,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   I know that my Redeemer lives
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.920]   and he will sustain me until the last day of my death.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   Oh, until my last day on earth.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   Alas, he also did provide the best path
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   at his timing.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   I still came here to Berean with my faith tested
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.920]   and strengthened through all the trials.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   I want to conclude with Matthew 13.45
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   to encourage you to persevere in pursuing Christ alone.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   "The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   "seeking fine pearls and upon finding
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   "one pearl of great value,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   "he went and sold all that he had
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   "and bought it."
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   How amazing that we already have Christ
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   and are called heirs of his eternal kingdom.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   Thank you.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.920]   [applause]
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   >> All right, well, thank you, Holly,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   for sharing your testimony.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   One of the things about Passion Week
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   is it's something that as you continue on
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   as a Christian every year,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   we kind of come back to this season
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   where we think about the resurrection
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   and we think about the crucifixion.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   And here at Berean, if you've been with us
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   for any number of years,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   year to year we do this,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   where we walk day by day.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   And one of the things--one of the reasons
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   why I love these testimonies so much
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   is because you can't help but get this sense
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   of a connection,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.920]   of something that seems so rehearsed,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   something that we have heard over and over again,
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   but these things are not separated
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.920]   from the testimonies that we hear,
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   that what Jesus came to do has everything to do
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   with what our brothers and sisters
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.920]   have been sharing over the last few nights.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   And that the sentiment of the fact
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.920]   that Jesus came to seek and save the lost,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   that matters.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   And so what we're doing
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   in understanding and seeing of our Christ
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.920]   has every effect
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   and every importance to our lives
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   like right now.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   And so I hope that we continue
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   as we go through Wednesday's happenings
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.920]   to remember that that has that connection to us.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   Let me open us up in prayer here.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Heavenly Father, we pray, God,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   that your word,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   as it describes our Lord's last days
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   before the crucifixion,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   would strike deep into our hearts,
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   that we would see it so much more
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   than a story that we already understand and know,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   but, Lord, that it would be fresh,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.920]   that it would open our eyes again,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   and that we would marvel,
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   that we would grieve,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   that we would worship and adore,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   that Christ would be magnified,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   and, God, that you would be glorified.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Well, as we've gone through these days,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   we're going to continue to give a rehashing.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.920]   On Sunday, on day one,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.920]   this is something where we would call it Palm Sunday,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   and Pastor Peter gave a sermon on it this past Sunday,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   where the people were crying out,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   "Holy, holy, holy,"
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   or, I'm sorry, "Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   and they were using these big palm branches to worship.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   And in the midst of this, this is the first slide here,
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   in the midst of this, we saw that Jesus grieved.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   And so that was one of those things
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   where when you took some time to step back
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   and look at what happened,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.920]   it's quite a strange sight
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   that Jesus would be grieving
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   in the midst of all this worshiping that was happening.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.920]   And it sets up a theme for the week.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   Because on the second day,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   it says that Jesus curses the fig tree.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   He clears the temple.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   And in this, again, this is a place of worship.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   This is a site where people are coming
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   and they're sacrificing to God.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   And again, Jesus is not acting
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.920]   in the way you would think that he ought to act.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   Instead of receiving the worship of the people,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.920]   he sits there and he begins to preach and to teach,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   and then he begins to overturn the tables.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   On the third day,
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   Jesus begins to pronounce the woes on the Jewish leaders.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   He tells them to be aware of the future
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   and what's to come.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   And he's doing all of this
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   aimed at the religious leaders of Israel.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   These were the teachers.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.920]   These were the scribes.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   These were the ones who had devoted themselves
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   to the temple, to the law, to God.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.920]   And again, Jesus does not act the way we would assume.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   It's a packed few days
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.920]   from Sunday, when all are praising him,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   to Monday, when people are shocked
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   as he flips over these tables,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   and to yesterday, when parable after parable,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   and he says woe after woe
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   to these Pharisees and scribes
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.920]   that this judgment is coming upon you.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   And it doesn't fit.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   And so if we go to the next slide,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   here's what we see.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   That on Sunday,
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   Jesus does not receive the worship of the people.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.920]   On Monday, he does not receive the temple worship,
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.920]   and on Tuesday, he does not receive the worship
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   the religious leaders have set up in Jerusalem.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   This is all with a backdrop, remember,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.920]   of the Passover.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   Passover was the single biggest event in Israel.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   This is the time of the greatest form of worship.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   This backdrop is so important
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   because this was supposed to be
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.920]   the singular passion of the time,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   to make it to the Holy Land,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   wherever you were as a Jew,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   to come back to this place,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   that all the remnant will come back together.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   They know the prophecies.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.920]   They recognize the understanding
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   of the remnant being pulled together,
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   that this one,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   as they're coming back year after year after year,
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   that they were there to worship God,
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   and yet Jesus was showing
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   that this worshiping of him was for nothing.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   Jesus was not looking at things
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   the way humans looked at things.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.920]   He didn't see these attempts of worship
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   as true and spiritual.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.920]   In fact, Jesus looked at them
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   in the exact opposite way.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   He wept.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   He grew angry.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   He rebuked.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   This was all upon a religious people
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   who were, in the name of worship of God,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   doing all of these things.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   It would have been better for them
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   not to corrupt the Holy City.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.920]   It would have been better for these people
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.840]   not to corrupt the Holy Temple.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   For these people not to set up these laws
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   that they would corrupt
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   in a fake and vain attempt of worship.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   And this is the exact thing
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   God had been telling them.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   They were not unaware of this.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   In the book of Isaiah,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   in his prophecy,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   if you want to see how Jesus felt,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   if you want to see how Jesus,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   why it is that Jesus acted
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.840]   in the way he did the last few days,
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   you can look at Isaiah chapter 1, verse 11.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   I mean, look at this.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.840]   Take a deep, long look at this
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   and compare it to what we've been seeing
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Look at the heart of Christ.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   It says, "What are your
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.840]   "multiplied sacrifices to me?"
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   says the Lord.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   "and the fat of fed cattle,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   "and I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.840]   "or goats.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   "When you come to appear before me,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   "who requires of you
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   "this trampling of my courts?
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   "Bring your worthless offerings no longer.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   "Incense is an abomination to me.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.840]   "New moon and Sabbath,
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   "the calling of assemblies.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   "I cannot endure iniquity
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   "and the solemn assembly.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840]   "I hate your new moon festivals
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.840]   "and your appointed feasts.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.840]   "They have become a burden to me.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   "I am weary of bearing them.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.840]   "So when you spread out
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   "your hands in prayer,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.840]   "I will hide my eyes from you.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   "Yes, even though
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   "you multiply prayers,
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   "I will not listen.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.840]   "Your hands are covered with blood."
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   Now, this next slide is
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   what I want us to kind of
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   concentrate in on here
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   as we look at what happened
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   on this Wednesday.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   "How the faithful city
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   "has become a harlot.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   "She who is full of justice,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.840]   "righteousness once lodged in her,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   "but now murderers.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   "Your silver has become dross.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   "Your drink diluted with water.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   "Your rulers are rebels
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.840]   "and companions of thieves.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   "Everyone loves a bribe
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.840]   "and chases after rewards."
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   And look at this prophecy.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   Look at this prophecy
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840]   before we go into
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   the happenings of this Wednesday.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   Look at how it is
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.840]   that Jesus was feeling.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   Why it is that he was angry.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   Why it is that he wept.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   Why it was that
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   as people were attempting
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   to worship God
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   and in the name of a worship of God,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   that Jesus did not try
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.840]   to just rectify or correct them.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   That he said,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   "It would be better
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   "not to have done this."
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.840]   And look at this passage.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   "The faithful city," he says,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   "has become a harlot."
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.840]   This is adultery.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   And he says,
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.840]   "You are murderers."
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.840]   The faithful city is Jerusalem.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   He says,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   "Jerusalem,
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   "you have become murderers."
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   You think Jesus does not know
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.840]   what's going to happen
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.840]   as the people are singing
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   "Hosanna, Hosanna."
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   He says,
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   "Their silver meant for worship
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   "is now dross."
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   He says,
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840]   "Their leaders are rebels
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   "and thieves."
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.840]   Remember when he was
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   overturning the temple.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.760]   He says,
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760]   "You've made this place
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   "into a den of robbers."
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760]   Take special note of that
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   as we look at today's happening.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   He says,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   "Everyone loves a bribe
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   "and chases after reward."
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.760]   Wednesday is also called
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   Silent Wednesday.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.760]   This is because the Gospels
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   are silent on Jesus' activity
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.760]   during this day.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   The Gospels move directly
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   from Tuesday evening
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   into Thursday.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.680]   But there is movement going on
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   behind the scenes.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   What we know about Silent Wednesday
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   is that Judas Iscariot
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   is active.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   He's on the move.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   He goes to the chief priests
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   and scribes.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   Essentially,
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   he goes to the leaders of Israel.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   And if you would turn with me
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   to Luke 22 1-6.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.680]   If you don't have your Bibles,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   you can look up here.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   But please turn there
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   if you do Luke 22 1-6.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   With Isaiah fresh in our minds,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   it says,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   "Now the feast of unleavened bread
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   "which is called the Passover
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   "was approaching.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   "The chief priests
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   "and the scribes were seeking
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   "how they might put him to death
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   "for they were afraid
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   "of the people.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   "And Satan entered into Judas
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   "who was called Iscariot
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600]   "belonging to the number
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   "of the twelve.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.600]   "And he went away
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   "and discussed with the chief priests
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   "and officers
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   "how he might betray him to them.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.600]   "They were glad
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   "and agreed to give him money.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   "So he consented
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   "and began seeking
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   "a good opportunity
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   "to betray him
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   "to them apart from the crowd."
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   That's it.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   That's what we see
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   in this Wednesday.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   As you look at Luke chapter 22,
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   take note.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   Take special note
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.600]   of all the parties
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   that are involved.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   Start from the top
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   and look.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.600]   Who's the first?
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   Which is the first party
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   that's brought up here
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   in Luke chapter 22?
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   The chief priests
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   and the scribes,
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   the leaders of Israel.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   What's the second party
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   involved here?
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   Satan.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   Satan enters into Judas
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   and the third party
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   is Judas
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   who's called Iscariot.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   Now if you look
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   at what each of these parties
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   are doing,
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   the religious leaders
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   were conspiring against Jesus
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.600]   to kill him.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   Secondly,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   Satan was moving
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   to kill Jesus
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   and third,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   perhaps most heartbreaking
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   of all
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   was that Judas
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   was conspiring
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   to have Jesus killed.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   Everyone involved
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   in this desire
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   to see Jesus dead.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   The word we find
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   in this Luke passage
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   is seeking.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   It's a very active word.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.520]   This is a word
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   of intention and purpose.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   This is a word
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520]   that has to do
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   with someone
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   who's setting their minds
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520]   on something.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.520]   In Colossians chapter 3
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   when it says
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   set your minds
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   on the things above
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.520]   it's the same word.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.520]   That we are setting
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   our minds on something
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   means that we would
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   be resolute upon something.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.520]   That we want
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   to accomplish something.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   That we are thinking
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   about something.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   We're scheming
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   and hatching out a plan
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520]   that we're strategizing
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   to get to the end of this.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   It's a word
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.520]   of intention and purpose.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   Everyone is seeking
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   for Jesus' death.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   It's the great focus here
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.520]   in this world of sin.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   With the leaders involved.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   With Satan involved.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   With Judas.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   One of Jesus'
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   closest relationships.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   The question is
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   what would possess
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   the people
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.520]   to be like this?
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.520]   What would cause people
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.520]   to seek Christ's death?
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   Have you thought
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   about that?
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   I'm sure you have.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   What harm
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.520]   has Jesus brought?
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.520]   You can say
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   the blasphemy thing.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520]   But hasn't Jesus healed
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.520]   the multitudes?
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.520]   Did he not make
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   the blind see
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   and the lame walk?
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.520]   Didn't he cast out demons
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.520]   who used to froth
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   at the mouth
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   and all of a sudden
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.520]   he heals them
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   where they're sane
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   and able to go back
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   into society?
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   Wasn't Jesus the one
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.520]   to multiply drink for many?
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.520]   To multiply the bread
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520]   and fish
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   and fed the thousands?
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   Didn't he heal people
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.520]   from years long bleeding?
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   Didn't he raise
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   someone's beloved daughter
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.520]   from the dead?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.520]   And the same to someone's brother?
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   Jesus had great teaching.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.520]   He was an innocent man.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   He was a good man.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   He was the best man.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.520]   He was awe-inspiring.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.520]   He was perfect.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   Say what you will,
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.520]   maybe people
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   can decide not to follow him.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   People can decide,
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   "I can't follow
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.520]   this kind of teaching."
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.520]   What would drive a people
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.520]   to want him killed?
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.520]   That that would become
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   their seeking.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   That that would become
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.520]   their focus.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.520]   Doesn't this seem
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.520]   terribly imbalanced?
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   And this is so illogical.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   This makes no sense.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.520]   Take note of the day.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   This is the day
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   before the Passover.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.520]   The day when people
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   would be preparing
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.520]   for the Passover meal.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   A day when the lamb
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   would be prepared
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.520]   and killed
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   on the eve of the Passover
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   is what it said.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   And just as the priests
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   were to be the ones
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.520]   to prepare the sacrifice.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   What we have
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.520]   in this story in Luke
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.520]   is that Judas,
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.520]   one of Jesus'
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   closest relationships,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.520]   holds hands
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.520]   with these priests of Israel
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   to prepare the Lamb of God
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   who takes away
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   the sins of the world
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.520]   to be killed.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.520]   Judas goes to these
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   chief priests and officers
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.520]   and discusses
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.520]   how he might betray Christ.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520]   In the account of Matthew,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   if we go to the next slide here,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   it records Judas'
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   actual words to these leaders.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.520]   Judas asks,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   "What are you willing
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   to give me
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   to betray him to you?"
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.520]   And we learn
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.520]   in this account of Matthew
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   that 30 pieces of silver
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.520]   is all it took.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   And this is shocking
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   because this was not
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.520]   just a crowd of people
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.520]   that witnessed all
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   the good that Jesus did.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520]   This was Judas.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   Judas did this.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   Judas was someone
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   so close to Jesus.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   He walked with Jesus.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   He didn't see
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.520]   only all the miracles
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.520]   Jesus did.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   He didn't only see
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   the power of Jesus.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   Judas saw
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   Jesus' compassion.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520]   Judas saw
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.520]   Jesus' love
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   and his grace
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.520]   and his desire
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   for people
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   to come to know him.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.520]   He saw
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   how much exertion
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520]   Jesus put,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   the sleepless nights
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   so that he would continue
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   around the clock
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.520]   with people,
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   that he cared so deeply
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.520]   for the people
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.520]   and for these disciples,
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.520]   he probably knew
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   how much Jesus loved him.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   Satan enters
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   into Judas, yes,
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.520]   but this was still
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.520]   the responsibility
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   and action of this man.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.520]   Judas doesn't just
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   give into a moment
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   of weakness.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   He calculates.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.520]   What would drive a man?
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   What would drive a people?
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   What would drive
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   these leaders?
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   What possible thing
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   has Christ done?
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.520]   After hearing
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   everything it is
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   to enter
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   into the kingdom,
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   after witnessing
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   and seeing
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   the Holy One of God,
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   the very presence
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   of God walking
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   upon the earth,
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520]   Judas paves the way
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   for sinful humanity
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.520]   to nail Jesus
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   to the cross
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.520]   in crucifixion.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   He single-handedly
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   paves this way.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.520]   Judas heard
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   that all Jesus
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   had to say yesterday
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   as Pastor Mark
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   took us through that.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   He heard all of it.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   He heard the woes.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.520]   He heard the judgment.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   He heard the rebukes.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   He heard
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   what's going to happen
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.520]   at the end.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.520]   He heard about the sun
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   that's going to be darkened,
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.520]   about the judgment
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   that's going to be proclaimed.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   He heard everything
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   you and I heard
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   and he doubles down
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.520]   in hardness of heart.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   The very next day
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   he goes straight
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.520]   to the leaders
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   to have Jesus killed.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   Why?
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   Because this is
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   what sin looks like.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   Sin is terribly illogical.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   Sin is terribly irrational.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.520]   Sin doesn't make any sense.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.520]   Sin will see what is good
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   and say,
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.520]   "Let's kill it."
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   See, sin,
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.520]   we like to dress it up
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.520]   as a society.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   We call our sins
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.520]   mistakes and flaws
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   and deviances.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   We say,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   "How could God be so cruel?
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   How could God be so exacting?"
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   But this right here
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   is sin.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   This is what sin looks like.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   This is a picture
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   of sin manifested
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.520]   in a man,
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.520]   in a leadership,
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.520]   in a nation,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   in a humanity.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520]   Calculating,
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   cold,
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   rebellious,
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.520]   angry,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   seething.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   It doesn't simply want
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   nothing to do with Christ.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   It wants Christ dead.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   It needs Christ dead.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.520]   And that's what we're seeing
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   here on this Wednesday.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   This sin in every fabric
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.520]   of humanity,
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   individual,
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.520]   even to the corporate level.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   Now think about
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.520]   in all of this.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   This is a silent Wednesday,
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.520]   but think of what must
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   have been going through Christ.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   What must he
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   have been thinking?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   What goes on
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   in the mind of our God?
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520]   This is the last week
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.520]   of Jesus' life
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.520]   before death on the cross.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.520]   These are the last days
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   before Jesus has to face
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   not just something
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   that is torturous physically,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.520]   but he's looking down
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:07.520]   the barrel of eternal wrath.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   In times of great anxiety
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   for us,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   think back to a time
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   when you had great anxiety.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   It's difficult
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520]   to get past
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   our own immediate view,
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   isn't it?
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   It's difficult
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   to concentrate on others
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   because we are
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   so fixated on ourselves,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   but not Jesus.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   And all we can see
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   in Jesus
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   is a love for God,
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.520]   his Father,
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   and a love for people.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   What must it have been like
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.520]   for Jesus
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.520]   in these last moments
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.520]   to know that betrayal
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   was to come?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   And Judas, yes,
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   but from all of sinners,
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.520]   that he was going
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   to take the sin
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   of people
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   who are so hostile.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.520]   I sometimes wonder
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   what it must have been like
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]   for a holy God
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   to walk amongst the vile,
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   amongst the wretched
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   and the depraved.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   The very same holy God
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.520]   whose very presence
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   melts and obliterates.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   A holy God
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   who,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   just by his very presence,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:08.520]   ought to create fear.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   And in the middle
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   of all this,
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.520]   that everyone around him
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   wants him dead,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   that's what he's facing
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   on this Wednesday.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   That's what he's facing
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   on this Passion Week.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.520]   For us,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   if we were able to,
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.520]   in hindsight,
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.520]   if someone were to betray you,
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.440]   and you look back at that,
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   we would almost assuredly
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.440]   protect ourselves.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.440]   At least we would perhaps
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   do something differently,
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   but with Jesus,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.440]   what we see
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   is he does nothing differently.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   He knows exactly
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.440]   what people are thinking.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   He knows what is coming to him.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   He knows what they want.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440]   He knows what Judas
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.440]   is going to do.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   And he does nothing
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:55.440]   to protect himself.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.440]   He knew exactly
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.440]   what was going to happen
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   and he did not change
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   his resolve.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   In fact,
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   the very next day
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   during the Passover meal,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   Jesus washes Judas' feet.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   Nothing changed.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   In his last days,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.440]   he had a love for God.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   He had a love for others.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   He had his face
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.440]   set towards the cross.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.440]   And though all of the world
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   wanted him dead,
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   he set his face.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.440]   Now this account on Wednesday
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.440]   reminds us of two things.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   First,
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   there's a lot to fear.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   There's a lot to fear
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   because we ought to take care
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   of where we stand.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   The story of Jesus
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   is frightening
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   because nearness to Christ
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.440]   means nothing.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   Nearness to the things of Christ
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   doesn't guarantee
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   our salvation,
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.440]   let alone our devotion.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.440]   We have to take stock
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.440]   of our lives
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   and we have to evaluate
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   our hearts
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   and see
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   where there is not only
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   a heart of unbelief
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   but perhaps
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   even a purposeful rebellion,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   resistance.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   And we can dress it up
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.440]   all we want,
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.440]   but sin is hatred of God.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   We all have a bit of this Judas
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   and some amongst us
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   are straight up
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   Matthew 7, 21 people
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   who will one day
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   come before God
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   and say,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   "Did we not do all these things
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   in your name?"
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   And Jesus will look
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   at these individuals
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   and say,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   "I never knew you.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   Depart from me."
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   What do you think
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   of Judas before a judging God?
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   What kind of words
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   will come out
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.440]   of Judas's mouth?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Do you not think
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   that Judas wouldn't
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.440]   hearken back and say,
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.440]   "Perhaps the works
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   that I at least did,
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   that the devotion
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440]   that I at least gave,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.440]   maybe that would be enough.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   It would be a ridiculous thing
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   to try to do that."
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   But don't you think
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.440]   he will try to do
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   whatever it is
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.440]   in his power?
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.440]   But in Matthew 7
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.440]   it says that
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   "I never knew you.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   Depart from me."
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   And that's it.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   And so there is great fear
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.440]   in this.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   The good news for us tonight
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.440]   is that Judas's time is done,
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.440]   but our time is not.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   That we still have opportunity
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.440]   to turn and to repent.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   You don't have to wait
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.440]   until Good Friday.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   You don't have to wait
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   until Resurrection Sunday.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440]   That you can turn
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.440]   and place your faith
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   in Christ.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.440]   And he will save you.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   You can let go
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   and surrender your arms
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   of hostility before God.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   Of a life that wants
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.440]   to be devoid of his control
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.440]   and to surrender
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   and say,
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   "Tonight salvation can be had."
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.440]   God is calling upon you
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   to turn away from your sin
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   and to turn towards him.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   And so secondly
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   there is hope
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   and there is grace
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.440]   and there is love
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.440]   in this story
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.440]   that we read about.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   We ought to remember
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   how great the love of Christ
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.440]   was in his sacrifice
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.440]   on the cross.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.440]   No one was with him
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   at the end.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.440]   The religious leaders
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   were against him.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   By the end
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.440]   the people were screaming
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   "Crucify him!"
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.440]   and even desiring
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   Jesus to die
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   over a high-profile murder.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.440]   His disciples had scattered
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.440]   in fear,
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   deserting him in the name
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   of the Savior's greatest need.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.440]   And most terrifying of all,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   the Father himself
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   unleashed all pent-up fury
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.360]   of wrath against his Son.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   In thinking of Judas
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   remember that Jesus
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   knowing what Judas would do
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   still chose to wash his feet.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   At the end
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   there is hope
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   and grace and love
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.360]   because in this story
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   this is the love
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.360]   of the Savior.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   He didn't die
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   for good people.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.360]   That's great hope.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   There is no scrubbing
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   of self
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   that needs to happen
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.360]   before we come to God.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.360]   There is only a cry
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   of surrender
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   recognizing our wretched state
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   and that he alone
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.360]   can wash my sins away.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.360]   That's it.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   That's all we need.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   This is a story
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   of great hope
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   because Jesus came
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   to die for wretched sinners.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   He was surrounded
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   by depravity.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   He knew exactly
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   what he came for.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   He knew exactly
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   what we would do.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.360]   And he still faced the cross
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.360]   and marched towards it.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   Why?
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:50.360]   Because of his love.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   I want to conclude
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   with John's account
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   of the Judas narrative.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.360]   John's account
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.360]   of the Judas's narrative
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   is the most beautiful
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   in my opinion.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   John 13.1 says,
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   "Now before the feast
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   of the Passover
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   Jesus knowing
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   that his hour had come
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   that he would depart
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.360]   out of this world
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   to the Father
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   having loved his own
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   who were in the world
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   he loved them
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   to the end."
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   On silent Wednesday
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   as the entire world
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   was working in conjunction
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   to kill him
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   we see the gospel message
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.360]   at work.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.360]   Despite how great sin is
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.360]   how much greater
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   God's love is.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.360]   That there is no one
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.360]   too far
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.360]   from his grace
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   and his love.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.360]   There is no one
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.360]   too far
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   to hope tonight
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   in the fact
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   that God can indeed
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   save you
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.360]   for the rest of eternity.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.360]   Tonight
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   as we look around
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   there is nothing
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.360]   righteous in me
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   there is nothing
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   righteous in us
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   there is nothing
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   good in me
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   in you
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   in this church
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   there is nothing
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.360]   good in our families
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.360]   in our jobs
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   in our nation
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   in our government
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   in this world.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.360]   There is only brokenness
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   there is only sin
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   there is only hostility
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.360]   against God
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.360]   down into sin
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.360]   and Jesus
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.360]   marches
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   resolutely
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   intentionally
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   purposefully
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   to the cross
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   to die for our sins
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   even though he knew
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   that we
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360]   would betray him
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   that we want
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   nothing to do with him
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.360]   that we want him dead
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   and that on Good Friday
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360]   hopefully
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   as we invite
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   all that we know
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   to come and hear
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   the gospel message
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.280]   that Jesus
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   is so good to us
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   and he cares
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   and God loves us.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   Let's take a moment
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   to pray together.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   Father
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   please help us
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.280]   to see the heart
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   of your son.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.280]   Please help us
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   to see life
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   through his eyes.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   God
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   to remember again
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.280]   what Christ did
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   why he came
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   and the fact
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   that he knew.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   God has all
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   conspired to kill
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   Jesus.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   Humanity has no
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   power to kill
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.280]   the son of man.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   Jesus willingly
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   silently walked
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.280]   to his death.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   He purposed
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   he intentioned this
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   to fulfill
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   your will
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   because of his love
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   for the world.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   And so God
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   as we prep our hearts
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   continually
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   would you again
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.280]   open our eyes
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   to marvel
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   and to worship
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   at our Lord
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   at our King
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.280]   that we would grieve
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   again our sin
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   that nailed our savior
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   to the cross.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   So thank you so much God
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   for this time of year
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   every year
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   that we can remember again
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   your great grace
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   and your love
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   for us.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   Amen.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:46.280]   Let's stand together.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.280]   What can wash
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.280]   What can wash
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   away my sin
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.280]   Nothing but the blood
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   of Jesus
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   What can make me
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.280]   whole again
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   of Jesus
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   For my pardon
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.280]   For my pardon
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.280]   This I seek
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:36.280]   of Jesus
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.280]   For my cleansing
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   This my plea
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   of Jesus
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   Oh precious
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.280]   Oh precious
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280]   is the flow
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   That makes me
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   white as snow
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   No other
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   fount I know
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   of Jesus
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.280]   Nothing
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   Nothing can
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   force in a tomb
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   of Jesus
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   Not a good that
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   I have done
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:54.280]   of Jesus
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.280]   Oh precious
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   Oh precious
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   is the flow
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   That makes me
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   white as snow
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.280]   No other
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.280]   fount I know
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   of Jesus
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   This is all
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.280]   my hope and peace
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   of Jesus
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.280]   This is all
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   my righteousness
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   of Jesus
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.280]   Oh precious
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Oh precious
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.280]   is the flow
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   That makes me
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   white as snow
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   No other
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.280]   fount I know
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.280]   of Jesus
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   Nothing
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280]   of Jesus
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.280]   Nothing
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   Nothing but the blood
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   of Jesus
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:56.280]   Father, God, that is
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   what we sing and this is our plea.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.280]   Father, there is no other fount I know
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   nothing but the blood of Jesus
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   and pray God that Christ would be
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.280]   that precious, that singular to us
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.280]   so as we look forward now to
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.280]   the Passover meal tomorrow and
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   to Good Friday, to Resurrection Sunday
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   God that our hearts would be filled
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   with worship as we behold
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   and gaze upon your great majesty
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   in Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   You may be seated.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   Just a few quick announcements here.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.280]   So tomorrow is the Passover meal.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280]   The Passover meal is
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.280]   not open to everybody.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.280]   It's open to anybody who has signed up
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.280]   and so please make sure to come
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   even before 630 if possible
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   for the Passover meal
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.280]   and specifically for the Passover meal
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   following today
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.280]   there is going to be a setup meeting
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   in the cafe after this is over.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   So if you signed up to help
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.280]   set up for the Passover meal
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.280]   please don't talk to each other
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.280]   and just go out the doors and walk
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280]   across the way to the cafe
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   so that you can be given instructions
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.280]   as to how to set up that cafe.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.280]   Another announcement here
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.280]   is that we still need volunteers
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.280]   for Passion Week
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   specifically for a few things
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   to help serve lunch after
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   second and third service
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.280]   and then after second service
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   to set up tables and chairs in the courtyard
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   and then to help clean up
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   after the lunch is over.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.280]   So if you just kind of take a picture
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.280]   of this QR code or scan it
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   those things we still are in need of help.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280]   So if you're kind of like
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.280]   do I really want to raise my hand up right now?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   This is the time to do it.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   If you have time
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   if you have availability
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   please come and help us with that.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.280]   And the last announcement here
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.280]   for Good Friday
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   and for Easter Sunday
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.280]   especially for Good Friday
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   please come in a timely manner
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   on Good Friday
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   if you can come earlier if possible
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   so that we're not all rushing the doors
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.280]   at once and trying to find parking
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   all at once in the dark
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.200]   and all together
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   specifically so that those who are coming
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   to our church as visitors
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   it will be easier for them
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.200]   and that we can receive them too.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   And take note of the special parking
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   that's going to be
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   just for Good Friday.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   Well that's it.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   We hope to see you if not tomorrow
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   on Good Friday.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   Good night everyone.
