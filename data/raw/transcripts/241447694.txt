[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, let's pray that we'll get into it.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this evening and the privilege that we have to gather together
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.560]   and help us not to take for granted the freedom that we have, the access that we have to your
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.960]   word, the church, the fellowship that we have.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160]   We know, Father God, that these are not things that all our brothers and sisters around the
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   world have free access to.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.160]   So help us, Lord God, to be good stewards of all that you've given.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.240]   Help us to be students of your word, to learn, to love, and to cherish it, Lord God, to have
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.760]   it in our hearts, to worship and honor you.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.240]   We pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.280]   All right, so chapter 19, we're only a chapter away from the millennium.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.520]   We talked about that from the very beginning, that everything that we've been talking about
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.400]   up to this point is kind of leading, obviously, to the end.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.560]   Today's study is about the marriage of the lamb.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.600]   Well, a portion of it is marriage of the lamb, but everything that God has been doing from
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.640]   the beginning is leading up to this point, that at the very end, it is a consummation
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.700]   of what Christ has done on the cross by bringing the church to himself.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.080]   And so when we think about the second coming, he's not just coming to condemn, he's not
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.120]   just coming to bring us to heaven, but ultimately it's a marriage ceremony.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.520]   So I know we have a lot of weddings at our church, and we have two coming up this weekend.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.200]   And you know, like those of you who've gone through that or been a part of a wedding,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.480]   you know the craziness that works up to the wedding ceremony, right?
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.260]   Especially the last week and the last few days before you get to the wedding ceremony,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.060]   you know, the great day, you know the chaos, but at the same time, the payoff on the wedding
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060]   day itself.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.820]   And so that's kind of how it's been.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.500]   The craziness starts and then it increases and then it gets utterly chaotic, and we've
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.180]   seen that in chapter 16, 17, and 18, and then chapter 19, we're kind of almost there.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.660]   We're not quite there yet, but we're almost there.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.500]   And then chapter 20, God takes us into the millennium, and then eventually 20, 21, and
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.300]   22 is going to describe the eternal state, which was all what everything that Christ
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.380]   has done was leading to.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.780]   So today, Revelation chapter 19 is going to be divided into two parts.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.260]   The first part is the praise, the three hallelujahs, right?
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.220]   The kingdom of heaven is breaking out into praise, and then the second part is the three
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.320]   separate visions at the end.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.900]   And so that's how it's going to be organized tonight.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.020]   First part of it, if you remember, again, connecting this to chapter 18, chapter 18
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.220]   was the downfall of Babylon and the judgment, the intense judgment that came upon the world
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.700]   and through the destruction of Babylon.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.460]   At the end of chapter 18, if you remember, the Antichrist, thank you.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:21.860]   Yeah, the Antichrist and the prophet and the kings, sorry, sorry, the Babylon is thrown
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.640]   into utter destruction.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.320]   And so chapter 19 is in response to God's judgment, right?
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.760]   And so God's judgment causes people to break out into worship.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.040]   So worship is a response in Revelation of God, not just Revelation of God's mercy and
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.240]   grace, God's justice is also reason for worship.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.000]   So the whole chapter 19 or a big chunk of chapter 19 basically is a response to the
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.200]   revelation of the wrath of God.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.840]   So again, we typically think that when we break out into praise or worship, we're always
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.880]   praising God about his goodness and about his mercy and his righteousness.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.200]   But if you look at the Psalms, a lot of the Psalms is very similar to chapter 19.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.560]   A lot of the Psalms is praising God for his wrath against the enemies, for his justice
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.040]   and also for righteousness, right?
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.680]   So whenever God himself is revealed, so again, the thing that we need to be cautious about
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.000]   is again, when we just kind of pigeonhole and think like the only time that we worship
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.560]   God is when God is being merciful.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.820]   But that's not how the Bible describes worship.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.580]   Worship is any time God's glory is manifested, whether it is in wrath or it is in mercy.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.960]   And so we see that in chapter 19, right?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.440]   His wrath is what initiates this intense worship.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.760]   So the first hallelujah we see in verse one and two, it says, "After this, I heard what
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.020]   seemed to be the loud voice of the great multitude in heaven crying out, 'Hallelujah, salvation
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.320]   and glory and power belongs to our God.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.840]   For his judgments are true and just, for he has judged a great prostitute who corrupted
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.200]   the earth with her immorality and has avenged on her blood of his servants.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.920]   Once more, they cried out, 'Hallelujah.'"
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.760]   So verses one and two is the first hallelujah we see, right?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.960]   Hallelujah literally means praise Yahweh.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.760]   You probably have been singing that all, maybe if you grew up in the church all your life,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.480]   but that's the literal meaning behind it.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.520]   It's two words, alel and Yahweh.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.360]   So hallelujah means praise Yahweh.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.240]   So the first step of the end times is judgment.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.560]   So when Christ comes, the scripture says the very first thing he's going to do, he's going
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   to judge the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.680]   And so that's what we see, right?
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.600]   He comes and he judges the world, and as a result of this judging, his people break out
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.880]   in praise.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.480]   God's glory is revealed in his wrath.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   So we're going off of, he says, "Salvation and glory and power belongs to our God," right?
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.840]   And that's the foundation behind the breaking out of worship.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   So salvation, right, initiated through judgment, God's glory revealed in his wrath, and his
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.400]   power demonstrated by his act.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.560]   And then he brings it to a close by saying God's judgments are just and true, or true
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.120]   and just.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.560]   Ultimately, God's judgment alone are true and just.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.960]   He's not saying that of all the many other things that are true and just, God's character
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   at its core is true and just.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.000]   You and I do not have the ability to determine right and wrong.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.680]   So ultimately, they look at the judgment of God, and they're not looking at the judgment
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   of God and asking, "Is this fair?"
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.040]   They immediately understand that this is just, this is righteous, because only God has the
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.440]   ability to be able to make that determination, right?
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.880]   And again, we're going to be talking about that later.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   That's one of the discussion questions that we're going to ask is, "Is hell just?"
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.160]   And that's a common discussion that we have even sometimes among the Christians, "Is God
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   just?"
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.880]   Because we're trying to determine based upon what we know, based upon what we think is
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.640]   fair, is what God doing just?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.920]   Is that fair?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.040]   So this is a praise and worship that's breaking out in context of God's intense judgment upon
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   the world.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.920]   And the first thing that they recognize, he's true and just.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.320]   So you and I do not have the ability to be able to judge what is right and what is wrong
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.760]   for two reasons.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.800]   One, you and I lack knowledge.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.520]   We don't have the ability to be able to judge what is right and wrong, even among us, because
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.920]   we don't know everything.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   We don't know the context.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   We don't know their heart.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.200]   We don't know what caused them to get there, right?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.360]   We don't know why they did it.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.400]   All we know is the act itself, right?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.440]   How many times have you seen something and thought that that's right or wrong, and then
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.360]   later on, having found more knowledge, found out that you were absolutely wrong about the
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   situation, right?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.280]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.440]   For sake of time, I don't want to get into it, but you and I don't have the ability to
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.400]   determine right or wrong.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.880]   Like ultimately, right, because we will always -- we're not omniscient.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.400]   We can't know all things.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   We don't know why.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.000]   If I did this, all we know is how it affects me.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.680]   But sometimes this may be happening because God has an all bigger plan of something down
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   the road.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   Just, again, a perfect example of that is Job.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.920]   Job, all he sees is the suffering that's coming upon him.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.120]   He doesn't know the big picture of what God is doing, right?
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.880]   And sometimes God may be doing something to affect what's going on 10 years later, maybe
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   the next generation.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.440]   We don't know that, right?
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.560]   And so we are not able to judge like perfectly because we lack knowledge.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.480]   Secondly, we lack the ability to be unbiased, even if we had the full knowledge.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   What we consider right or wrong is always based upon my point of view, right?
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.320]   My sins, my pride, my sins ultimately.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.720]   So I determine what is right and wrong based upon how it affects me.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.660]   So because we lack these two things, because of our own personal sins and because of lack
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:56.440]   of power to know everything, every judgment we make is always going to be flawed to a
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   certain degree, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Because we do not know everything and because of our own sins.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   So only God is ultimately just and true.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.800]   And so just and true, this worship that's breaking out here is referring to what?
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   His judgment, right?
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.480]   He's not saying his cross, he's not saying about mercy, he's talking about the judgment
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.280]   that's coming upon the world is just and true because only God is able to be omniscient
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.480]   and omnipotent and completely without bias, right?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.120]   God is not prejudiced.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.920]   He deals with sin.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.200]   And so even in his wrath, he's completely just and true.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.800]   The second hallelujah we see in verse three to five.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.040]   Once more they cried out, "Hallelujah, the smoke from her goes up forever and ever."
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.160]   And the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.640]   on the throne saying, "Amen, hallelujah."
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.200]   And from the throne came a voice saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.400]   him small and great."
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.240]   The smoke clearly is in reference to the judgment of Babylon that we saw in chapter 18, 9 and
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   18.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.880]   At Babylon, the great city was thrown into the lake of fire for eternity.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.440]   And so again, this praise that's breaking out, again, praising God for what he has done,
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.280]   praising God for the judgment upon Babylon.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.920]   And then this very common scene that we've seen in Revelations already, the 24 elders
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.240]   again respond with four living creatures in worship.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   So in my mind, one of the clear things that Revelation, one of the clear principles that
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.680]   we've seen up to this point, that if I was to illustrate it, I would have two, you know,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.000]   like in the screen cut in half.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.040]   The top portion of it would be heaven and the bottom portion of it will be earth.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:05.000]   And the earth is burning, hail, plagues, and people suffering and dying, a third of the
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.880]   earth being wiped out, right, and blood, famine.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   And that would be the description of the earth that we've seen.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   And then the top portion of it would be heaven.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.600]   And in heaven, the scene is again consistent, is a place where there's consistent worship.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.480]   God is on the throne, the 24 elders with the four creatures surrounding, holy, holy, holy,
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   right.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.400]   And that's the consistent scene that we have seen all throughout the book of Revelation,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   that in the midst of the judgment of God, that God is perfectly in control, right.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.800]   And so we see that again in all these verses.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:50.400]   And then not only the elders, but the voice from heaven calls out for the rest of creation,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.440]   all of his servants to praise God, right.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.200]   So praise for God's judgment is to be repeated on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.440]   So as I try to picture heaven in this one particular scene of heaven and earth, Jesus'
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.080]   prayer and told his disciple, this is how you ought to praise it, is that pray that
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.120]   his will be done on earth as it is in heaven, right.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.680]   So the work of the church is to bring down what is happening in heaven on earth.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.400]   God is looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.620]   So what's happening in heaven, it is what he is seeking down here, right.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.600]   And so that's the proclamation, that's the command of the voice that comes.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.520]   That scene that you have seen up in heaven, what the elders and the creatures are doing,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.080]   that this is a call to the rest of the world to do as well.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   And so you probably, again, heard the phrase from John Piper, "Let the nations be God."
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.520]   Evangelism exists because worship does not, right.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.000]   If God's ultimate purpose of salvation is to restore worship, if that's what we lost
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   at creation because of the fall, God's primary purpose of evangelism is to restore that worship,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   right.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.440]   So what we see in heaven will be repeated on earth.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.040]   And that's what we're going to see in the millennia.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.840]   When Satan is bound, you're going to have a thousand years where Christ himself is going
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.400]   to directly reign, okay.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.880]   And that's coming in chapter 20.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:28.400]   The third hallelujah, we see in verse 6 through 9, "Then I heard what seemed to be the voice
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.800]   of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.400]   of thunder, crying out, 'Hallelujah!
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.580]   For the Lord our God Almighty reigns.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.300]   Let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.120]   For the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.360]   It was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.760]   For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.880]   And the angel said to me, 'Write this, blessed are those who are invited to the marriage
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   supper of the Lamb.'
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.140]   And he said to me, 'These are the true words of God.'"
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.700]   You can see in the third hallelujah that the praise, at least in the language, it intensifies,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   right?
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.300]   It's almost kind of like the music is getting louder and louder, right?
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.220]   The call to worship is growing, it's intensifying.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.980]   Again, this is where it says, "Like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   praise."
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:33.260]   Again, the third hallelujah is a call to worship, again, more intensified.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:42.100]   And the praise is specific to the marriage lamb, marriage of the Lamb.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:49.060]   And again, as I mentioned, marriage of the Lamb is a picture that we've been given all
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.900]   throughout the New Testament about salvation.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.620]   So again, we mentioned this many times before, but the purpose of salvation is not to simply
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.820]   save us from hell, right?
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:06.740]   That's obviously a huge byproduct of saving us, but the purpose of salvation ultimately
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:13.180]   described is to bring us in a marriage relationship with Christ, right?
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.540]   So it's a very intimate relationship.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:21.860]   So God didn't save us, simply have a legal relationship with him, right?
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:27.820]   That's why salvation ultimately, glorification is described as a marriage, right?
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.460]   So every time we have a marriage ceremony, we try to remind the congregation and the
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:38.020]   people that everything that we're doing in a marriage ceremony is to reflect the marriage
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.820]   supper that's going to happen at the end times.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.260]   And that's what Christian marriage ultimately is.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.060]   Everything that we do in a Christian wedding is kind of a playing, right?
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:57.020]   So playing what we will ultimately see up in heaven, right?
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.060]   The image depicts the Lord's relationship with his church, and again, we see that over
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.460]   and over, 2 Corinthians 11 too.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.940]   I feel divine jealousy for you for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.140]   virgin to Christ.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.820]   That's why Jonathan Edwards in his book, Religious Affection, he said one of the greatest evidence
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.660]   of salvation is genuine affection for God, right?
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.940]   He said that's the top evidence of salvation.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.220]   Not if you attend church, not are you, you know, versed in theology and how many verses
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.100]   you memorize and how, you know, how often you evangelize, all of these things can be
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.900]   faked, right?
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.220]   All of these things can be done in order to please other people, right?
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.620]   To be man pleasers.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.580]   But he says the greatest evidence of genuine salvation is affection for Christ, right?
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.940]   And that's exactly how it's described.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:57.660]   Paul says his purpose of evangelism and salvation was to betroth them to Christ, to have an
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.860]   intimate relationship, to restore what was broken, right?
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.900]   Ephesians 5.25, again, this is a famous verse that you guys all know, right?
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.060]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.020]   So this is a relationship between Christ and us, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.940]   her by the washing of water with the word so that he might present the church to himself
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.740]   in splendor, right?
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:26.180]   Not simply to release her from sin's bondage, but to release her for what purpose?
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.700]   So we can be betrothed to him, right?
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   So it doesn't make sense.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.260]   It's only partially, partial understanding of salvation where we think of salvation as
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.540]   just our penalty for our sins have been paid for, right?
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.900]   It's been paid for for a reason.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.820]   Because of that sin, we couldn't be married to Christ.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.380]   Only way that we could be married to Christ is by paying of that blood.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.300]   But the purpose of it is to bring us to him, right?
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.740]   And that's how salvation is described.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.420]   Again, we see the marriage of the lamb.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:08.580]   If you remember, before all the judgments happened, right, what was the first scene?
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.700]   In chapter five?
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:16.580]   Before the seal judgment happened, what was the first scene that we saw in chapter five?
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.140]   They're all crying because the scrolls were sealed and no one could open it, right?
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.140]   They're weeping.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140]   Who's going to open this?
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.460]   And then they say, "Don't worry, the Lion of Judah is coming."
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.460]   And they turn around.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.780]   What do they see?
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.060]   The Lamb of God standing there as slain.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.460]   So the beginning of the judgment started with the Lamb of God.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:43.180]   And then at the end of the judgment, it brings us to the Lamb of God, right?
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.580]   So it's kind of like the bookend, the bookend of the judgments.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:58.140]   It begins, he opens the judgments, and then he closes the judgment, okay?
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.580]   So this is an interesting scene here.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:07.860]   In John, in verse 10, he's hearing all these fantastic things, and he sees the heavens
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.020]   opening up and praising God.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.360]   And then John's response in verse 10, "And then I fell down at my feet to worship him,
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.220]   but he said to me, 'You must not do that.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.060]   I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to this testimony of Jesus.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.140]   Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.'"
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:33.580]   Now he's doing this in response of seeing heavens just opened up and praising and worshiping
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.940]   God because of his mighty deeds, because of his judgment, and they see his glory.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:45.500]   And so John basically is overwhelmed by this scene and sees the messenger, the angel, and
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.420]   he naturally is on his knees to worship, right?
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.840]   Remember what worship is?
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:58.720]   Worship is a reaction when you are confronted by something much greater than you, right?
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   Worship is a reaction.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.160]   Worship is not something that you tell yourself and say, "You know what?
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.640]   I'm going to really worship this."
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640]   You end up worshiping.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.560]   God has created us to be creatures of worship.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:15.160]   So whenever something that you are attracted to, right, something magnificent that's beyond
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   you, we usually, typically, our natural reaction is to worship.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   So that's what John does.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.400]   John is in the presence of this messenger who's giving him this fantastic message,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.120]   and his natural reaction is to bow down and worship, and he gets rebuked for it, right?
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.680]   Clearly, because this would be a breaking of the top two, top commandment.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.080]   "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.480]   And so immediately, right, the angel is not flattered by what he is doing, but it's almost
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.480]   like a panic.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.040]   "Don't do that," right?
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.840]   "Don't do that.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.240]   I'm a servant just like you.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.880]   You need to worship God and God alone."
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.200]   Now why is this so significant?
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.000]   Because at the core of Satan's rebellion is this, right?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   At the core of Satan's rebellion is he wanted to be in the place of this angel and have
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.880]   creation worship him.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.760]   And so this angel stands there and sees John worshiping, and he's not flattered by this.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   This is dangerous.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.900]   He needs to correct him immediately.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:30.640]   In fact, you can fill that out, "Worship the messenger rather than the creator," okay?
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:37.160]   Even though it's only one verse and it kind of says it in passing, this is a very dangerous
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   scene, right?
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.720]   I mean, if you understand the larger redemptive history that this is what triggered all the
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.560]   rebellion, right?
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.680]   So think about it.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.180]   In John's perspective, he may have just done it in natural instinct.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.460]   He didn't think like, "Oh, should I worship this angel?"
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:02.180]   He just immediately in reaction, because so much fantastic information and vision was
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:08.980]   coming through this angel, his natural reaction was to worship, right?
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.520]   Now the danger behind it is that it is so subtle.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.600]   Because we are creatures of worship, we naturally bow down and honor and adore things that are
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.100]   greater than us, right?
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   You don't think about that.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   You don't...
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.280]   That's not something calculated.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.560]   You don't sit there and say, "You know what?
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   I'm going to worship this rather than God."
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   Worship happens, right?
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.080]   When you are exposed to something that you automatically think like, "Wow, this is awesome,"
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:44.160]   whether it's sports, right, or whether it could be another human being, whatever it
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.800]   may be, when something in your heart is naturally attracted to that and is bigger and greater
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.480]   than you, our natural response is worship, right?
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.780]   But the danger behind that, right?
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.920]   John himself explains later on in chapter 22, that very scene that we just saw in verse
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.600]   10, he said, "I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.760]   And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.880]   them to me.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.720]   But he said to me, 'You must not do that.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.540]   I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers in the prophets and with those who keep the
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.000]   words of this book.'"
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.160]   And he says, "Worship God," right?
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.440]   In Colossians 2, 18 and 19, Paul himself warns, "Let no one disqualify you, insisting on cynicism
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.080]   and worship and angels," going on in details about visions popped up without reason by
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   his sensuous mind.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:41.120]   So again, Paul, even when he was writing the New Testament, says there was already a temptation
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.440]   to worship angels, right?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.240]   And not holding fast to the head, right?
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.520]   Instead of holding fast to the head, and who is the head?
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.000]   Christ, right?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.920]   Instead of fixing their gaze and worshiping Christ, it was the messengers that they were
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   beginning to worship, right?
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.040]   Where do you see that temptation in the New Testament?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.400]   It was causing all kinds of problems.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.880]   Maybe not in the form of angels, but possibly worshiping the messenger rather than Christ
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.240]   himself.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.880]   Where do you see that in the New Testament?
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.840]   Corinthians, right?
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.200]   Where all kinds of chaos and division was coming into church because they were saying,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.240]   "I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow Peter," and so they were loyal to the messengers
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.560]   rather than Christ.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.680]   And so that was causing all kinds of divisions in the church.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.520]   And on the surface, it may seem like a godly division, right?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.880]   Peter was the leader among apostles, so of course we should follow him.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.880]   Paul was anointed to the Gentiles and all these ministries were happening through Paul
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.840]   and so much fruit was coming through apostle Paul, of course we should follow him.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.400]   Apollos was the articulate orator and he was the great speaker and he was probably bearing
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.280]   a lot of fruit whenever he went.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.680]   Maybe people were being attracted to his preaching, so of course we would follow him, right?
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.360]   It seemed like for godly purposes, but in the end, it was destroying the church.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.520]   And that's exactly what he was saying.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.120]   Instead of holding fast to head, they were worshiping angels.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.920]   So this is the danger of the Catholic church.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:31.600]   The Catholic church subtly takes the power and the glory away from God himself and then
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.760]   you have to go through these mediators, right?
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.640]   They pray through these saints to get to Christ.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.200]   And so the danger in that is you start elevating everything other than Christ himself, even
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.920]   though with the intention of getting to Christ, right?
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:52.240]   Everything that we uphold in place where Christ needs to be eventually ends up becoming
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.640]   an issue, becomes a problem.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   If there's anything that I learned as a pastor in the last how many years that I've been
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:06.360]   a pastor, is that God will not share his glory.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.560]   He will not share his glory.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   And if there's any lesson that I need to, like greatest thing that I need to make sure
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.240]   that I don't do is that I touch his glory, right?
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.760]   Whether it's the preaching or whether it's fellowship, whatever I do, if at any time
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:33.240]   I begin to think to myself, I did this, that is because of me, because of my gifting, I'm
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:40.160]   in the most dangerous place because my job as a servant is to point to Christ.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:48.720]   So if you fall in love with me, that feels good, right?
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   But it's dangerous.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.080]   You can have a church filled with people who are magnifying the preacher rather than Christ.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.040]   So the ultimate goal of preaching is to have you fall in love with Christ, not with the
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.360]   ministry, not with a person.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.920]   So it's always dangerous.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.960]   And I meet people all the time where you talk about theology and they're always quoting
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   people.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:14.120]   They quote MacArthur, they quote John Piper, they quote Tim Keller, they quote books that
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.360]   they read, and they're always quoting people, right?
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.560]   And we can talk about, you know, they're excited about this form of Bible study and that form
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.280]   of Bible study and this form of church and that form of church, but it's not affection
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.120]   for Christ, right?
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.800]   You can talk about things of Christ without talking about Christ, and that's the danger.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.840]   So even though this is kind of one verse in passing, if you think about the larger picture,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.360]   this at the core is the rebellion of mankind, giving glory to creation rather than the creator.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   And so the angel immediately recognizes that and he corrects him or rebukes him.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:58.240]   Do not worship me, worship God, right?
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.360]   Number six, the vision, right?
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.840]   And then after that break, he sees three specific vision.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.760]   The first vision is the one sitting on the white horse.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:14.920]   It's pretty clear that this vision is the vision of Christ of Revelations 1, 12 through
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   16.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.200]   Jesus is called faithful and true.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.960]   He's faithful to his promises and proven true by his fulfillment, right?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.000]   He's faithful because everything that he has promised, he fulfills.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.920]   So ultimately he is faithful and true.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.840]   I'm not going to read that, but just for your reference, the description that we see of
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.280]   the one sitting on the white horse is the almost exact same description that we saw
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:59.160]   when Christ was introduced in Revelation chapter 1.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.440]   He says he will wage war in righteousness, verse 11.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   So Jesus came the first time as a humble servant to save, right?
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.440]   And here's the mistake that sometimes the church can make because we have this lasting
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.880]   image of Christ on his knees, washing the feet of the disciples, being crucified, cooking
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.320]   a meal for his disciples before he ascends into heaven because that's what we see in
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.120]   scripture, right?
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.920]   That's what we see in the gospel.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.500]   Jesus is not in his glorified state when he ascends into heaven.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.520]   But the picture that we see of Christ in heaven is not that humble servant.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.840]   It's the picture that we saw in Revelation chapter 1.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.680]   That's the present state of Christ.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.040]   Even in Philippians chapter 2, remember he says he's humble, right?
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.760]   He took on a human form.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.800]   He humbled himself even to the point of death on the cross.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.000]   And as a result of that, right, he will be exalted.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.600]   Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.620]   And so his reward for his humility, God exalts him.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.680]   So he's in an exalted state, right?
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:16.480]   And so when we talk about one of the foundational books that we read is lordship salvation,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:24.920]   right, is that a lot of people have this mentality that when you get saved, now you have Christ
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.880]   for the rest of your life serving you, right?
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.000]   He wants you to have your best life now.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.600]   He wants you, what do you desire?
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.720]   And then you pray, and then God answers your prayer.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.600]   And so not that any of that is wrong, but fundamentally, fundamentally you have a wrong
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.680]   view of Christ, right?
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.680]   We serve him.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.720]   He doesn't serve us, right?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:54.520]   So he comes the second time, not as a humble servant, but as a conquering king, a warrior.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.580]   He will come as a king of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.840]   So if people had this image of the servant Christ who's going to come and wash our feet,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.220]   not that he won't, but that is not the image that we are seeing, we are shown in the scripture.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:17.480]   He's going to come as a conquering king, right, in his full glory.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:24.140]   Says the writer's name is the word of God.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:29.300]   And he's the word of God because in Revelation chapter, Hebrews chapter 1, 3, he's revealed
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.520]   as God's revelation.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   So Jesus himself said, if you want to know, it is not what you put into a man, but what
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.680]   comes out of a man that defiles him, right?
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.200]   Because it reveals what's in his heart.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.000]   So the words are the revelation of that person.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.860]   So the scripture describes Christ as his word.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.040]   In the beginning was the word, the word was with God, and word was God.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.720]   Who's that in reference to?
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   Jesus, right?
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.840]   Jesus himself is called God's word.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.160]   The reason why he's God's word is because the words are the revelation of who God is.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.320]   Christ is a physical revelation of who God is, right?
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.960]   John 1, 14, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.240]   glorious of the only son from the father, full of grace and truth.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.600]   So God revealed himself through visions and through prophets, but in the last days, how
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.840]   does God reveal himself?
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   Through his son, right?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.600]   Where before he sent messengers saying, this is who God is.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.840]   Had prophets saying that this is what God told me to tell you.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.360]   Where in the New Testament, Jesus himself is the word, right?
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.200]   The direct word of God, he's revealed.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:51.200]   Before we got, basically you're playing, you know, it's not tag.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.240]   Is it called word tag?
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   When one person says something, the other person says something?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.200]   You know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.600]   So basically in the Old Testament, that's how we knew God.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.200]   God spoke through his servants.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   God spoke through visions.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.160]   He spoke through his spokespeople, but in the New Testament, God himself comes as the
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.960]   word, right?
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.360]   So what we see in Christ is the clearest revelation of God himself, and that's why he's called
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   the word of God.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.520]   First John 1, that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.080]   our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our heads concerning the word of life.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.280]   So Christ comes as the word.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:38.160]   God's word himself comes, and we are able to not only hear him, but see him, right?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.920]   Again the verse that I quoted, Hebrews 1, 3, he is the radiance of the glory of God,
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   right?
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   So if you've seen Christ, what does he say?
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.440]   Remember the disciples asked, just show us the father.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.280]   And what does, remember what Jesus said?
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.200]   If you have seen me, you have seen him, right?
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.520]   He's the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprints of his nature, and he opposed
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.240]   the universe by the word of his power.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   After making purification for his sins, he sat down at the right hand of the majesty
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   on high.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.840]   So Christ himself is a revelation, right?
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840]   The word of God.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:24.720]   And then he says, he's going to come, treading on winepress of the fury of the wrath of God,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:31.080]   which is prophesied in Isaiah 63, 1 to 3.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.400]   Basically you see the crushing of the wine, right?
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.760]   Which, again, let me read, Isaiah 63, 1 to 3.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.880]   Who is this who comes from Edom in crimson garments from Bozrah?
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.120]   He who is splendid in his apparel, marching the greatness of his strength.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.680]   It is I speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   Why is your apparel red and your garments like his who treads on in the winepress?
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.280]   I have trodden the winepress alone and from the peoples no one was with me.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.840]   I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.760]   Their lifeblood splattered on my garments and stained all my apparel.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:15.040]   So again, the final vision that we see is Christ riding on the white horse, right?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.160]   And he's come to declare war, right?
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.760]   The final and great war.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:26.280]   And at that, his judgment is going to be like crushing of wine.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.640]   It's going to be completely crushed.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.420]   And so you see the picture of the grapes just bursting.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.420]   And so that's the picture.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.000]   So again, this is a description, right?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.080]   Oh, I thought I was at the end.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   I'm not at the end.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:45.320]   Okay, the vision of the angel standing in the sun calling for birds to devour the flesh
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.000]   of all things.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:56.320]   This is a vision that points to utter destruction and rebellion.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.520]   So when you see the corpse lying on the ground and the birds coming, basically there's so
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.880]   much destruction, so much death that they don't have time to bury their dead.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.440]   Their line is kind of like if you ever see a war movie and you see bodies laying down,
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.160]   you know, there's so much death that the birds just come and attack.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.480]   And that's the scene that is described at the end, right?
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.840]   Let me just read Jeremiah 7.33.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.680]   "And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air and for the
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.880]   beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away."
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:35.240]   So all of this is prophesied in the Old Testament.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.840]   And then the final vision of the beast and the earthly king.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.560]   The beast, we've already studied, that is the Antichrist, and he rules the greatest
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.000]   kingdom and Christ is going to come and crush him.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.720]   Kings of the earth, we saw that the ten kings that represent the ten horns that follows
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.560]   the Antichrist, and they will also be crushed.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.800]   And their final state is the Lake of Fire.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:07.640]   It is the first place that is mentioned, first place that's mentioned in Revelation, and
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.320]   the beast and the kings will be thrown in it.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.520]   And this description of this Lake of Fire we see in Isaiah 66.24, "They shall go out
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.240]   and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me, for their worms
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.320]   shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be abhorrents to all flesh."
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.520]   Again in Matthew 25.41, "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.200]   cursed into the eternal fire, prepare for the devil and his angels.'"
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.400]   All who rebelled against God and followed these demonic forces, they shall all be cursed.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.200]   Mark 9.48, "Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched."
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   Again this is a direct quote from Isaiah 66.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:57.160]   So this is the end of man's rebellion.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   It's not the final end because there's a thousand year reign of Christ and after that there's
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:07.760]   going to be the final judgment, the great white throne judgment before we enter into
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   eternity.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:17.680]   But this is the judgment that takes place and then you'll see in chapter 20 where Antichrist
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.920]   and the kingdoms and Babylon, all of them has been destroyed.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:28.800]   So the only rebellion that's left is Satan himself and Satan is bound and you'll see
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.200]   that in chapter 20.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.640]   He's bound for a thousand years and after the thousand years he will be let go for a
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:43.040]   period to purify, so to deceive and then at the very end of that he's going to throw Satan
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.760]   into hell for eternity and then those who rebelled even in the thousand years will also
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   follow him.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.840]   So there's going to be a second purification before they enter into eternity.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.400]   So again that's chapter 20, 21, and 22.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.680]   So we're very close to the end.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.080]   Discussion questions for today.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.280]   Again when you see the scene in heaven, ultimately God's purpose of everything that he's doing
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.320]   is to restore worship.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:18.040]   So our very first vision in the church is to have God-centered worship and not man-centered.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:24.840]   So God's ultimate goal in your life is to restore what was lost at the fall, God's image
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.460]   in us to worship.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:31.440]   So there's nothing, we could say biblically there's nothing more important in your life
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:37.080]   than worship and there's no greater worship that you give to God than your corporate worship
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.500]   where the whole body of Christ comes together.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:47.560]   So Sunday worship should be taken very seriously because that's the ultimate purpose of salvation
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.220]   is to restore us into that worship.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:55.020]   So what we do on Sunday is a reflection of what we do in eternity.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:00.280]   So yes private worship is important but what we will do in heaven is ultimately is a reflection
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.320]   of what we do on Sunday.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.780]   So therefore again I want to highly encourage you guys.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:13.040]   I know that we are blessed to be able to travel and to do various things but I think it is
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:19.480]   unwise and unbiblical to see Sunday worship as an option.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.920]   And I know some of you guys work on Sunday and so you might have to go to worship at
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.240]   night time or you might have to find some other options but corporate worship is not
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.040]   something that you can just kind of have when you can and not when you don't want to.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.920]   So we highly encourage you even if you are traveling to do your best to find corporate
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   worship somewhere.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.400]   Now having said that just attending worship doesn't make it good worship.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.680]   Basically showing up on Sunday doesn't mean you came to worship.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.640]   Worship is something that happens in spirit and in truth.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.840]   So the first question is what helps and hinders your Sunday worship?
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:06.920]   You may say well maybe the air conditioning, parking, or the preaching or the singing,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   whatever it may be.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   But we are talking about you specifically.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.000]   Something that you can control.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.040]   What helps and hinders?
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.320]   What are some of the things that you are engaged in that helps you to worship God on Sunday?
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.720]   What are some things that you are engaged in that doesn't help you?
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:28.160]   I know some people, especially you collegians, there's no collegians here.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.960]   I know some of the collegians, they are in a habit of sleeping at 4 or 5 in the morning
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.520]   and then they wake up at 10 o'clock to come and worship and then they are just out of
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.960]   it and I know who they are because I see it from up here.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.280]   So that's a habit that needs to be broken.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.320]   So if you are in a habit of like yeah you know all we have to do tomorrow is Sunday
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:53.560]   worship so therefore I don't have to be 100%.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   If Sunday worship is the most important thing that you are doing throughout the week, shouldn't
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.040]   that get your most undivided attention?
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.440]   So I'm not saying that you can't do this on Saturday, you shouldn't stay out late,
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.640]   I'm not saying that you can't do that, that's a judgment you need to make.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.520]   But if you are regularly in a habit of coming into worship, just dragging yourself in, tell
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.240]   me that doesn't affect your spiritual life.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.440]   Tell me that doesn't affect your affection for God and your fellowship and building up
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.360]   for the kingdom and evangelism it does.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.480]   Because at the core of what we do is worship.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:33.720]   So your private prayer life, fellowship, building, evangelism, all of that, the foundation of
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.800]   all of that is worship.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.280]   So if you have a biblical worship as your foundation it will affect your Bible reading,
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.320]   it will affect your fellowship, it will affect your marriage, it will affect everything else.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.600]   So that's the first question.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.640]   Second, in what way has Jesus proven to be faithful and true in your life personally?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.440]   And I'm not talking about world affairs, I'm not talking about someone else's life, but
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.160]   you personally, how has God proven to be faithful and true in your life?
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.800]   Thirdly, some argue, and this is a question I brought up before, some argue that literal
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.260]   hell is unfair when compared to the brevity of our lives.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.780]   So the typical argument, this is, you know, like sometimes Christians, even Christians
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:23.540]   will argue, you know, our sins are committed during a limited period of our life, 70 years,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:28.820]   80 years, no matter how long we live, but punishment is eternal.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.820]   How is that fair?
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.820]   Right?
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.860]   And so a lot of debate happens because of that question.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:41.140]   But clearly, don't twist what the Word of God says.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.220]   The Word of God clearly says it is eternal.
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   The Word of God clearly says that it's going to be quenching the gnashing of teeth.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.460]   So the description of hell is clear.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   So let me encourage you.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.860]   When we did hermeneutics, I went through this before, but when we discuss about things that
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:10.980]   are difficult to understand, you have to separate between exegesis and philosophy.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.100]   So the order in which it has authority is one is exegesis.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.700]   What does the Bible say?
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.740]   Right?
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.820]   But sometimes when we have a hard time understanding what it says, we start to twist what it says.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.580]   Oh, it can't mean this.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.580]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.300]   And then all of a sudden, because you have a hard time putting God's sovereignty and
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:35.340]   man's free will together, so therefore this must not be, and then you start reinterpreting
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.340]   what the scripture says.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.340]   Okay?
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.540]   So first, exegesis.
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.820]   What does it say?
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   Don't change what it says because it's hard for you to understand.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.380]   Second level is historical theology.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.580]   Historical theology is what is the theology that's been passed down to us, right?
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.740]   Meaning generation to generation, the church fathers, the denominations, what is the consistent
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:02.420]   doctrine of hell, again, hell as an example, that has been passed down to us, that's been
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.500]   tested, argued, written, right?
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.540]   Exegeted, preached on throughout the generation.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.460]   So we can't ignore that.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.300]   That's not the final authority, but it has to have some authority in our life because
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.420]   it's been passed down to us.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.820]   So exegesis is always on the top.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.140]   What does the Bible say?
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.180]   And then compare that to historical theology, right?
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.260]   I skipped something, systematic theology.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.980]   Systematic theology is basically a compilation of exegesis, right?
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.300]   All right.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.860]   For the purpose of my argument, let's skip that for now.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:41.780]   So exegesis, systematic theology, historical theology, and then it's philosophical theology.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.780]   Philosophical theology, here's a theology that clearly is stated in scripture, systematically
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:51.420]   it's talked about and taught and all throughout scripture, it's consistent teaching.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:57.140]   Historically, this is the theology that we've been given from generation to generation,
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.140]   right?
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.020]   So philosophical theology is how do we understand this?
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.420]   How do we make sense of this?
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.540]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:12.060]   So you can't go from your authority cannot be, your final authority cannot be do I understand
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.540]   it or not understand it.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.020]   You can't reject theology based upon does it make sense to you?
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.300]   Does it seem fair to you?
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.860]   Is it logical to you?
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.420]   That's a philosophical argument, right?
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.660]   Because the authority of God's word does not depend upon you understanding or not understanding
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.660]   it.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:38.020]   The authority of the Bible comes to us does God, did God say it or not say it, right?
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:46.780]   If God told Jeremiah to lie on his side for 360 days, Jeremiah doesn't say why should
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   I do that?
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.580]   I don't get why you're doing that, right?
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.300]   God calls Isaiah to go preach to people who are not going to listen.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.500]   He doesn't say well that doesn't make any sense, why would you do that?
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.540]   All he asks is are you the Lord?
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.500]   And if you're the Lord then I obey.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.620]   I don't understand it but I obey, right?
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:14.060]   So what I'm asking you to argue or to talk about is philosophical, right?
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:18.900]   This is a philosophical argument of how do we understand this?
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.180]   What is already written, clearly written in scripture, systematically has been proven,
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:28.460]   historically has been given to us, how do we reconcile this, right?
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.220]   You understand my question?
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:34.140]   Okay, so I want to set that as a base so that your argument doesn't go all over the place
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.980]   and then the end result is, ah we don't believe in him, right?
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:43.260]   I want to make sure that that's not where this discussion goes because the Bible does
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.980]   clearly teach that and historically that's the doctrine we've been given, okay?
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:59.220]   All right, let me pray for us and then I'll release you to your small groups.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:04.140]   Gracious Father, we ask Lord God that you bless the time of our discussion.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:10.620]   Help us to be open, be honest, even with our lack of faith, some things that are hard to
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:16.380]   believe, help us Lord God to be honest so that our faith may be genuine.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:21.860]   Help us not to live by fear of man but to fear you.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:27.260]   We ask Lord God that you bless the time of discussion, help us to clearly understand
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.260]   that we may sharpen one another and so we entrust this time to you Lord, in Jesus' name
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   we pray, amen.
