[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   All right, so today we're going to be going through biblical interpretation.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.080]   And again, I know those of you who've taken hermeneutics who've been at our church for
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.400]   a while, again, a lot of this stuff is going to be reviewed, but I think it's important
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.960]   that we have everybody at the church who are members and growing in the church that we're
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.600]   on the same page.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.080]   You know, I think for me, one of the most frustrating conversations that I have, oftentimes,
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   I don't think it happens much in the church, but it's oftentimes outside the church when
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.020]   I run into other pastors or other Christians or I'm speaking somewhere and we happen to
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.000]   have a disagreement on a particular doctrine, maybe a woman in ministry issue.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.160]   More and more it seems like the homosexuality, that issue, even inside the church, it's being
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   debated.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.520]   It's sad, but it's being debated.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.080]   But when that subject comes up, it's the way that we argue or discuss, it's frustrating
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.840]   because we've strayed away from the authority of the word of God.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640]   In fact, most churches I know will confess in their doctrinal statement that they believe
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.920]   that the word of God is inerrant, but it's not being used that way.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.880]   The word of God is not the final authority.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.280]   It almost kind of like, well, you come from a conservative church, that's what you believe.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.720]   You know, I'm not sure if that's what I believe.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600]   And so, well, do you believe in the word of God?
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200]   I'd say, yes, of course I believe in the word of God.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.800]   But do you believe what it says about that?
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.280]   I'd say, yes, but that's your opinion.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.520]   I have this opinion.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.000]   But it's never really about interpretation of what the word of God says.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.640]   It's just your opinion versus my opinion.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.920]   It's extremely important for us that not only do we confess the word of God as having authority,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.720]   we need to actually practice that it has authority.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.260]   So the way we think, what we consider right or wrong, what we practice has to be based
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.720]   upon a careful study of the word of God.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.460]   Not your prejudice, not whatever's happening in our culture, not what other Christians
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.440]   are thinking, that it has to be based on God's word.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.360]   So from the very beginning of our church, the reason why we chose the name Berean was
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.000]   because we want to be a church that actually tested the word of God to make sure that what
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   we're standing for is His word, right?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.220]   Not just we're Baptist or we happen to be Reformed or we have, you know, whatever doctrines
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220]   that we have.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.160]   Today, we're going to be going over some interpretational issues.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.200]   So again, this is not a hermeneutics class, so we're not going to be able to spend a lot
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.020]   of time, but just basic principles of how we ought to understand Scripture and how to
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020]   apply it.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   How do we come to truth?
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.020]   Okay?
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.480]   So, I'm not going to answer all your questions, but hopefully, at least fundamentally, we're
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.000]   on the same page when it comes to this.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   So perspective of interpretation, there's three things that you'll see.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.440]   The first perspective of interpretation is in the third-person approach.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.720]   We call that exegesis, right?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.460]   And in essence, it's discovering the truth.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.160]   And I'm going to go a little bit more deeper into that.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.360]   The second is in the first-person approach, which is for devotional purposes, which is
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.380]   personal application.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.840]   So first approach is finding out what does it say?
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   What is the truth?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.660]   Second, how does it apply to me?
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.120]   And then the second-person approach is homiletical, sharing the Word to others.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.840]   Okay?
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.880]   So whenever we approach the Scripture, we have to approach the Scripture with all three.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.400]   The temptation that I have as a pastor or a teacher, or maybe some of you guys who are
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   Sunday school teachers or whatever, that we can get in the habit of just studying for
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.680]   number three.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.200]   You know, it's dangerous if we just come and say, "Oh, you know, are there materials in
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.160]   the Bible that I should teach?"
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.780]   And then it never makes a personal impact on you.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.440]   These are the three steps that every time we open up the Scripture, one, what does it
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   say?
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   Two, what does it say to you?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   How does it impact you?
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   Third, how do I share this?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   Okay?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   In that order.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.000]   So let's go visit that.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.040]   First one is the third-person approach exegesis, which is discovering the truth.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   Right?
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.800]   The question that we need to answer is, what does this mean?
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.520]   Right?
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.640]   Not, what does it mean to me?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.200]   Oh, sorry, that's not it.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   Yeah, what does this passage mean?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.240]   So careful attention to the laws of interpretation.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.520]   Applying some of the hermeneutical principles that we're going to be talking about today.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   And hermeneutics basically means the guidelines of how to interpret Scripture.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.240]   What did the original audience understand?
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360]   Before we get to anything.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.560]   What did he mean, and how did they understand it?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.640]   Two thousand years ago when the New Testament was written, what did they understand?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   And we need to really be careful that when we're studying, that we're really taking
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.880]   our time to figure that out.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.240]   There are certain things that, certain phrases that we say today that may not have made sense
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   thirty years ago.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   Right?
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   Even twenty years ago.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.400]   We just had this conversation with Esther.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.800]   One of our kids said the word "sick."
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.440]   And she's so square, she didn't know what it meant.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Sick.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   And I had to explain to her.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   Right?
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   This is how cool people use the word "sick."
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   It means good or cool.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.120]   And she just didn't get it because she's from a different era.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.440]   She's always making fun of me, so I'm up here.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   Alright.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   So, you know, certain phrases or certain words that we use.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.400]   I mean, this was used two thousand years ago.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.600]   So when we interpret certain passages, that we don't go in there and say, "Oh, they're
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   using the word 'heart.'"
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   Like that's another one of those words that when you see the word "heart" in the Bible,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   the word "heart," the way they use it is very different than the way we use it.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   Right?
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320]   We use it as emotion.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.520]   They use it more of a will or soul.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.360]   Like it encompasses everything.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.320]   So we have to be careful that we do our homework to find out what did they mean by it.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Right?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.800]   The other thing that I had a really hard time with is the term "slavery."
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.360]   Because there's so many negative connotations, obviously because of recent history in the
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.520]   last hundred, hundred and fifty years.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.320]   And so we project a lot of things that we know to be evil, which I'm not saying that
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.440]   slavery at that time was considered a good thing, but it culturally, it's very different
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   the way they use slavery.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.940]   It was almost part of their economy.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.480]   So when we begin to project a lot of the criticisms that you will hear from the liberal media
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.640]   or from people who are trying to knock Christianity, it's because they're interpreting from their
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.480]   understanding of what these things mean.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.400]   So the first step is understanding what did they understand?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.920]   How did they understand it?
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   Right?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.480]   So you have to do some homework.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.720]   You have to go back, maybe read some commentary, some cultural stuff.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.080]   And the more you do this, the easier it'll become.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   Because your knowledge will grow.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.960]   And the more you understand about what was happening during that period, the more, less
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.440]   work you have to do to figure this out.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.580]   So this is the first and most important part of biblical interpretation.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.340]   What did the author mean?
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.000]   How did they understand what he said?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Okay?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.400]   So a lot of the passages in the Bible where you say, "Oh, that seems to contradict."
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   Right?
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   "He said this over here, and he said that over there."
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.360]   But when you do a careful study, you realize that, again, it's not a contradiction at all
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.440]   when you understand the culture and what they meant by it.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.960]   The danger of not doing this, or to ignore this step, is the interpretation of scripture
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.200]   is no more than personal opinion and conjecture.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.680]   That if you're in the habit of just opening up in scripture and saying, "Well, this is
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.760]   what I think this passage means," and you have an accumulation of knowledge that you've
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.320]   gained from a superficial reading of the scripture, you can come out with all kinds of doctrines
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.520]   and you think it's biblical, but when you actually carefully study it, you find out
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.320]   it has nothing to do with scripture.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   Right?
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.600]   So we have to be very careful.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.640]   So when we're saying that we want to be Berean, this is what we mean.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.320]   We want to test every doctrine, every movement, right?
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.000]   Every doctrinal position to make sure that it's coming from scripture.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Right?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.520]   Not from our denomination, not from anywhere else, but from scripture.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   Okay, sorry.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.160]   Let me go back to that.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.680]   So if we don't do that, the danger is it begins to lose authority.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   Right?
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.560]   If what we're preaching and saying is simply based upon my experience, well, my experience
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.000]   is no better than yours, and it's no better than the person down the street.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Right?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.320]   The authority has to come from the Word of God.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.440]   And so if we're going to speak with authority, it has to be based on truth.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.160]   Not my opinion, not your experience.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.280]   The second is the first-person approach is devotional.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   Right?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.680]   So the first part is interpretation, and then the second part of it is application.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   Right?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   What does this mean for me?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.040]   Okay?
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.000]   Not what does it mean to me.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   Meaning not to get into the scripture and say, "Well, when you read this, what do you
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   get out of it?"
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   Right?
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.840]   First, do the homework of interpretation, and then, applicationally, what is God convicting
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   you of?
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.200]   So, if we miss this part, again, those of you who've been at our church for a while,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.640]   I've said this so many times.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.080]   Right?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.640]   Interpretation without application is what?
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   Is what?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.600]   Abortion.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.920]   Application without interpretation is what?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.240]   Is a miscarriage.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   Right?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   Either way, you didn't take it to full term.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   Right?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.420]   Because the purpose of interpretation is for the purpose of application.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.040]   Not simply so that we can read it and say, "Well, I know more than you."
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   Right?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.100]   So, the Word of God is what?
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.800]   It judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   Right?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.200]   So, the biggest part of understanding the will of God, a lot of times we say, "Well,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.840]   does God want me to go here or there?
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.960]   Does He want me to marry this person or that person?"
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.720]   And a lot of times we're searching for circumstantial of what does God want me to do?
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.320]   Does He want me to be a doctor?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.360]   Does He want me to go to this school or that school?
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.640]   Oftentimes, the will of God has a lot to do with why you're doing that.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.680]   Right?
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.940]   Why do you want to marry this guy?
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.940]   Why do you want to go to this school?
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.560]   Why do you want to go into that field?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   Right?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.380]   So, why do you want to do that?
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.600]   Oftentimes we'll determine if that, you're doing that to honor God or for your own purpose.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.880]   So, God doesn't have like, "Well, this person is supposed to be a doctor and that person
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.640]   is supposed to be a lawyer and this person is supposed to do that."
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   Right?
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.840]   So, there's a reason why the Scripture says in Romans 12, 2, "Not to conform but be transformed
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.540]   by the renewing of your mind.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.400]   Then you will be able to test and approve that which is good and perfect will of God."
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   So, when your mind is renewed according to the Word of God and you're convicted and your
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.560]   sins are being exposed and you're being sanctified, then you're able to discern your own heart.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   Right?
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   What is right and wrong.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.580]   So, the second part of the interpretation is application.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.400]   How do we apply the things that we are learning?
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   Right?
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   We're not seeking personal opinions, but application of truth.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   Right?
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.720]   How does this affect my life?
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.960]   What is God saying to me through this passage?
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.840]   And then again, the danger of not applying that is that there's no spiritual growth.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.960]   If you are in the habit of constantly learning and not applying, what does that make you?
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.280]   It's just like eating, no exercise.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.360]   Right?
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.800]   You keep eating without exercising and you're out of shape.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   Right?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.240]   That's what happens to somebody who's constantly learning.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.880]   Especially if you happen to be going to a church where the Bible is taught on a regular
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:10.400]   basis, right, then you probably know more theology than an average person, an average
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.760]   Christian maybe, outside of a church that doesn't teach the Bible.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:20.280]   And you get a false sense of security that you are more mature than you really are.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.360]   Right?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   Because what makes you mature is not because you heard the Word of God, but that you heard
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.160]   it and you applied the Word of God.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   So that's the danger.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.400]   If all it is is interpretation and hearing, and you're not actively trying to practice
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   what you're learning, it just makes you a better hypocrite.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.560]   So that's the danger of number two.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.660]   And then third person, homiletical, spreading the Word to other people.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.080]   And that question is, how do I share this with other people?
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.080]   Right?
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.960]   Because ultimately the word "gospel," "eugelion," means "good news."
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.000]   Right?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.240]   And the gospel is not just Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.480]   It's not just certain passages about Jesus.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.800]   The whole Bible ultimately is the gospel.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.600]   It's the good news.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.800]   Because it is the story of redemption of mankind for His glory.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.200]   So the very title of what the Bible means is to tell people.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   It's good news.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   Right?
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.960]   But if we're studying it, and we're trying to apply it, and all it is is that you're
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.800]   just kind of introspective about yourself, but you're not ultimately sharing it, then
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.600]   again you missed the mark.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.740]   So the failure to do this is to fail the mandate to share the good news, the gospel.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.240]   The very meaning of what the Scripture is.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   Right?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.560]   It is meant to be shared.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.200]   We are the light in a dark world, so it was meant to be shared.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:51.240]   So everything that we're learning ultimately is meant to be shared.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.640]   So these are the three perspectives that we have in interpretation.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.920]   First, know what the meaning is.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.720]   Second, how does that convict you?
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.080]   What are applications you need to make?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.480]   And third, how do I share this with other people?
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.040]   So some of you guys may be sitting there thinking, "Well, I'm not a pastor.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.900]   I'm not a small group leader, so that doesn't really apply to me."
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.900]   It applies to everybody.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   Right?
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.180]   When we're talking about sharing, we're not saying that you need to be teaching people.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.180]   Right?
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.420]   Sharing simply means if you've been convicted about something and you share this with somebody
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.900]   else, right, you don't have to have the title "teacher" to be able to share.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.940]   You can share your testimony.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.620]   You can share the blessings that you have in the Word of God, certain things that you
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.180]   learn, and we're able to sharpen each other as a result of it.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.460]   Or share the gospel with people.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.540]   Right?
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.180]   This makes a huge difference in if the Word of God, like if the Word of God has become
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.820]   stale to you, right, eventually it becomes stale.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.300]   If you're not in the habit of sharing the things that you are learning, I guarantee
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.180]   at some point it's going to become stale.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.180]   Right?
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.020]   It's going to become stale.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.420]   Even the gospel, no matter how much you tell yourself, "Jesus died for me, Jesus died for
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.180]   me, Jesus died for me," right, at some point, if you're not in the habit of sharing the
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.220]   good news with other people, even the gospel will become stale.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.020]   Because it was meant to be shared.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.020]   Right?
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.340]   Our sanctification and our love for the Word of God is always in the context of not only
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:20.180]   learning, but convicting and sharing all three of these things.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.580]   Okay.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.980]   Now this part is extremely important.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:30.140]   Again, this is probably a review for a lot of you, but again, I want to make sure that
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.580]   we understand.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.460]   The four different stages of interpretation, and how we interpret the scripture, and it
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.940]   has to be in this order.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.100]   Okay?
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.800]   So memorize this.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.020]   It has to be in this order.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:51.140]   If you start interpretation and how you get doctrine by philosophical theology first,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.440]   and you work out backwards, you're going to get all kinds of false doctrines.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.780]   And usually that's how false doctrines come about.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   Okay?
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.180]   And I'm going to explain what that means.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.700]   It has to follow this order.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:08.820]   So let me just quickly go over it, and then I'm going to dive into it one by one.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.500]   Exegesis obviously is a verse by verse study of God's Word.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.900]   What does it mean?
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.900]   Right?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:21.140]   By doing your homework, this is where you get into the Greek, the cultural background,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.660]   what is the context, right?
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.380]   This is where you read the commentaries and figure out what does it mean.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.580]   So you have this, you can't have systematic theology.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.620]   Okay?
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.620]   And systematic theology is basically a compiling of information that you gained from exegesis.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Okay?
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.220]   Did I lose anybody?
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.300]   Okay, so you understand what I'm saying.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.960]   Historical theology is basically theology that was handed down to us in church history.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.620]   So the church fathers got together at the church councils, at church meetings, where
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.820]   they fought and argued based upon scripture, what does the Bible say about Jesus?
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.300]   What does the Bible say about the Trinity?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.820]   What does the Bible say about salvation, the end times?
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.820]   And so we compare our exegesis, systematic theology, with historical theology.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.820]   Right?
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.380]   I'm going to get into it a little bit more, so if you're confused, I'll come back to it.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.860]   Philosophical theology is trying to make sense of what we talked about.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.020]   Right?
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.460]   So I'll get into it a little bit.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.660]   We get into trouble when we start with philosophical theology.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.820]   Right?
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.900]   What makes sense?
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.380]   So let me give you an example.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.980]   A philosophical theology may be embracing a theology because it makes the most sense
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.780]   to you.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.440]   And I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.100]   If I try to explain the Trinity to you, okay?
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.620]   If we had two people up here, and we start debating, which doctrine makes more sense
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   to you?
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.100]   A Jehovah Witnesses doctrine of the Trinity, or my doctrine of the Trinity?
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   Three in one.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.100]   Right?
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.660]   One times one times one equals one.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.220]   And they say, "That makes no sense.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.580]   It's one plus one plus one equals three.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.620]   Jesus is speaking to his Father, you know, it just makes more sense.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.500]   And what you're saying doesn't make any sense."
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   Right?
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.020]   "That doesn't fit my reality, so therefore, that's not what the Bible teaches."
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:33.420]   So if I argued this man without the scripture, which theology would you choose?
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.660]   Don't say it, because I already know.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.660]   Right?
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:42.200]   Common sense would tell you that you would probably choose the Jehovah Witness doctrine.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.300]   Because that makes sense.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.660]   They can explain that.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.340]   The doctrine of the Trinity that I'm trying to explain to you, I can't explain it to
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.340]   you.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.980]   It's not explainable.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   It's a mystery.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.220]   So if I came up here and told you, "Who is Jesus?
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.220]   He's God."
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.740]   Well, is he the Son?
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.740]   Yes.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.740]   Is he the Creator?
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.740]   Yes.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   Is he distinct?
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740]   Yes.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   Are they one?
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740]   Yes.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   Was he man?
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740]   Yes.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.740]   Was he 100% God?
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   Yes.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   100% man?
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740]   Yes.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   Ah, I reject that.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740]   This guy's crazy.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   Right?
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.140]   So philosophical theology is trying to make sense of what the Bible says.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.460]   So if you choose theology based upon what seems to make the most sense to you, before
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.100]   you do the homework, you're going to end up with all kinds of false doctrine.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:32.620]   If the Word of God is God's Word, we have to first study what does it say.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.620]   Right?
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.620]   What does it say?
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.420]   Not what makes most sense to you, but what does it say.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420]   Right?
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.380]   I'm going to jump into it a little bit further.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.260]   It's a careful analysis of the text, applying literal historical interpretation of the text,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.700]   doing our best to understand the original author's intent of the passage, which we already
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.340]   talked about.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.340]   That's exegesis.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.340]   And it always has to start here.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.900]   Right?
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:06.020]   I had a discussion with somebody years and years ago, when I was a youth pastor.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.780]   He graduated high school, and then he ended up going down to UCLA.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:16.060]   And then he started attending this church, and was very anti-charismatic.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.940]   And he knows that I'm not a charismatic.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.980]   I'm open but cautious, if you know what that means.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.060]   But I'm not a, you know, I don't practice the charismatic, because obviously you're
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.420]   members at this church.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.340]   He came back, and he was pounding.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.740]   He said, "These charismatics, you know, they're not right with God, they don't know anything
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.740]   about God."
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.260]   And he was just going at it.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.580]   And he was going at it with not debating with me, but thinking that I would agree with him,
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.380]   because he knew I wasn't charismatic.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.020]   But the concern I had with the way that he was going after the charismatics was, he heard
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.020]   certain things when he went down there.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.980]   And they were very passionate about slamming the charismatics.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.980]   Right?
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.580]   So I asked him, "So why do you believe that?"
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.900]   And he said, "Well, because the Bible said so."
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.900]   So I asked him, "Where?
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.380]   Where in the Bible does it say that?"
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.460]   And he got kind of caught off guard, because he was like, "Are you charismatic?
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.460]   Why are you defending them?"
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.700]   He's like, "I'm not defending the charismatic.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.660]   I'm defending the Scripture.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.580]   So you're a young guy, you're coming here passionate, you're just like bashing all these
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.580]   charismatics.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.940]   I just want to make sure that you understand where your passion's coming from.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.180]   That if it's coming from a conviction of Scripture, or you just happened to find a group that
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.740]   was passionate about this."
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.460]   And so I challenged him to look through the Scripture.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.300]   So he came up with a couple of verses, and I said, "Are you sure that's what it says?"
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.740]   Then I played the devil's advocate, and it took no more than a minute and a half to destroy
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.100]   his argument.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.860]   And so I was trying to get to my point.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:54.300]   My point was, if you come to a conclusion of a doctrine the way you came to a conclusion,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.380]   this is what causes divisions in the Church.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.860]   This is what causes self-righteousness and pride.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.980]   And you are absolutely convinced that you are right.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.260]   And I'm not saying that you're wrong.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.320]   But the way you came to that conclusion is wrong.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.620]   You got passionate because you found somebody that you really respected, and he came out
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.620]   very strong.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.860]   And so you said, "Oh, that sounds right."
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.220]   And so now you became this anti-charismatic.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.300]   So I was trying to caution him, "Don't come to conclusions that way.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.700]   You're just kind of hysterical.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.300]   You just have a mob mentality.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   And so any wind of doctrine that comes in that seems to be right, and certain people
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.380]   that you respect can cling to that, then you're going to end up just jumping onto the same
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   boat."
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.700]   And that's a very dangerous way to come to convictions.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.780]   So first and foremost, you have to do your study.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:50.340]   If you're going to say, "This is what I believe," make sure you're able to back it up by passages.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:58.420]   Not by people, not by anything else, but where in the Bible did you get this conviction?
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:05.380]   Systematic theology, you can't have a systematic theology if you didn't do the exegesis.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.860]   So if I asked you, "What are your views about the end times?"
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.900]   And I run into people all the time that say, "Oh, I'm a dispensationist, or I'm a covenant
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.780]   theology, or I believe in pre-trib, post-trib, I'm a millennial."
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.420]   And they'll throw all these terms, and I'll ask them, "Where did you get that?"
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:28.100]   And they'll say, "Well, I learned it in catechism, I learned it in school, and I went to seminary,
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   or…"
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.380]   They'll mention all these things, "I read this book, and this guy, the Anabaptists,
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.180]   believed this, or Zwingli believed that," and they'll throw all these terms around.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.220]   I say, "That's not what I asked you.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.660]   I asked where in the Bible, what passage were you studying, and which passages were you
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.460]   studying that caused you to see that that made more sense to you?"
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.620]   So if you come to a conclusion on that subject just because, "You know what?
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.260]   That makes more sense to me, that Jesus would come back once instead of several times, or
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.660]   that he would be pre-trib, because it just makes sense that the Church wouldn't go through
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.580]   the Tribulation, or the Church would go through Tribulation, that makes more sense to me."
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:10.580]   It's not just not wise, it's dangerous if you come to conclusions like that, because
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.620]   that's how false doctrine comes into the Church.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.080]   You can live your whole life thinking that you are doctrinally correct, without ever
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.460]   really being doctrinally correct, if that's the way you come to conclusions.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.820]   So systematic theology is a collection, right?
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:34.980]   So if you're not diligently—and again, I say this with utmost caution—if you are
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:41.740]   not diligently studying the Bible, do not be strong in the doctrinal convictions that
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.700]   you have.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.620]   You can't be.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.020]   Right?
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.320]   You can't be.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.940]   How did you come to that conclusion?
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.820]   If you're not studying the Word of God carefully, it's just your prejudice.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.020]   What sounded right to you, right?
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.220]   Or certain people that you trust.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.660]   So that's not a wise way to come to a conclusion.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   So systematic theology.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.620]   So an example of systematic theology would be God's nature.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.060]   So if you say, "Oh no, God is love, love, love."
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.340]   I say, "No, God's Bible also says that God is holy, holy, holy.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.740]   He is omnipotent, omnipresent.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.900]   He is immutable."
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.260]   So there's all kinds of things about God that the Bible teaches.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.260]   But if you say, "Oh, I grew up in a church where all I heard was, 'God is love, love,
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.260]   love.'
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.300]   Or maybe you went to a church where all you heard was, 'God is holy, holy, holy.'"
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:41.220]   And your doctrine of who God is, is not systematic theology, but just prejudice.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:47.140]   So there are certain things that you can't come to a conclusion by just one verse.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.260]   Or even one book.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.780]   Systematic theology is a collection of careful study of the Word of God, which collectively
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.780]   points to something.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.660]   And that's where we get the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:05.620]   Doctrine of Trinity was a doctrine that I had such a hard time with when I was a young
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.620]   Christian.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.980]   Every Bible study I had, I asked them, "Explain the Trinity to me."
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.580]   And they tried all these illustrations.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:18.300]   And after they would give me their best illustration, they would always conclude by saying, "But
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.780]   it's not like that."
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.780]   Right?
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.900]   "It's kind of like the water."
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.200]   "It's like the ice.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.560]   It's like vapor."
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   You know?
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   What else did I miss?
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.420]   Did I say water?
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.700]   Water, ice, and vapor, right?
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.020]   So it's like three different elements.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.800]   And then they would tell me, "It's kind of like that."
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.740]   I was like, "Oh, okay, I get it."
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.140]   And then they would say, "But it's not like that."
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.220]   I go, "What?"
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.980]   So I would say, "Okay, maybe he's not smart enough, or he doesn't know the Bible enough."
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.980]   So I would go ask my professors, because I was a Bible major at Biola.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:59.260]   And every professor I asked would always give me, "It's kind of like this, but it's not."
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:04.980]   And then I realized, like, how can I believe in a God that I can't even explain?
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.660]   How do I come to worship a God that I can't even comprehend in my head?
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.220]   It was so vague.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.220]   Right?
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:18.620]   Well, the way that I came to conclusion and conviction of the Doctrine of Trinity was
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:24.380]   not from reading books or from talking to people, because the more I talked to people,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.620]   the more frustrated I got.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.420]   I was firmly convinced that this was God's Word.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.820]   And I'm not going to explain to you how I came to that conclusion.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.700]   But I was absolutely convinced that this was God's Word.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.700]   Right?
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.740]   Apologetics, the internal evidence, the Word of God itself.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.980]   But once I was convinced that that was God's Word, I began to study it systematically.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.780]   So it wasn't something that just all of a sudden I got.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.420]   The more I started to study systematically, the more I began to see that's exactly what
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.380]   the Bible teaches.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.740]   Jesus Christ is very distinct, but He says He is one.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.740]   Right?
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.600]   He says He is I Am, yet He is praise to the Father.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.980]   So I realized the Doctrine of Trinity came from a careful study of what the Word of God
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.980]   says.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.060]   And that's exactly what the Bible says.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.100]   They didn't try to package it.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.180]   They didn't try to, in fact, in the early church, one of the first things that the early
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:21.500]   church debated was there was this guy named Arius who was saying that Jesus Christ was
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.020]   a created being and He wasn't eternal.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.260]   And so he was so charismatic and influential, he almost had the whole church convinced.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.320]   Right?
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.380]   And this man named Athanasius who started, who was arguing, that's not what the Bible
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   says.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.420]   The Bible says, again, if I lose you, I lose you.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.620]   Council of Carthage where the church made an official stand in saying this is the final
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.780]   canon didn't happen until the Council of Carthage at 386.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.940]   He was arguing this in the early 300s, 315, 310.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:01.820]   And so I was convinced that they had the authoritative Word of God and Athanasius was arguing from
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.780]   God's inerrant Word.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.620]   And that was the only way that he was able to convince the church that the doctrine of
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.620]   Trinity was the right doctrine.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.080]   Does that make any sense?
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.300]   Because without the Word of God, if he didn't have the authority of the Word of God, there
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.220]   is no way that he could have argued against Arius and convinced the whole church that
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.020]   almost, almost universally went over to that doctrine.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.220]   Because that makes more sense.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.020]   That Jesus Christ is the Son and not the Father.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   Right?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.860]   See, they're all distinct, three different people, kind of like I'm the Father, Esther's
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:40.220]   the Mother, my son's the Son, you know, but we're all Kims.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   Right?
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   Right?
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.060]   Which we call as a false doctrine of tritheism.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.180]   Or I'm the Father, I'm also the Son for my mom, and I'm the pastor.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:56.100]   I forgot what the other one is, but I'm the same person.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.100]   That's modalism.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.700]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.700]   Right?
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:07.700]   So the only way the doctrine of Trinity that you and I have today was able to be argued
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.860]   authoritatively is because he had the canon.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.820]   He had the authoritative Word of God that was passed down.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.940]   It just wasn't given the official stamp later on until the Council of Carthage.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940]   Okay?
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.940]   Not all of that.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.740]   If it went over your head, just went over your head.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:30.980]   But the point that I'm trying to make is systematic theology has to come from exegesis.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.340]   Right?
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   It cannot come from your prejudice.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.600]   It cannot come from what makes sense or what doesn't make sense.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:42.260]   So when you do enough systematic exegesis and do careful study of the Word of God, it
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.280]   will cause you to have a better systematic theology.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.820]   So whatever you believe, I believe in the Trinity, I believe in the End Times, I believe
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.580]   about the nature of God, what the Gospel, what the Bible says about the Gospel, it has
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.820]   to come from your diligent study of God's Word.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.820]   Right?
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.100]   The whole point of the Reformation was to get the Bible to you.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   Because the Church kept on saying, "You're not smart enough to interpret the Bible for
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.140]   yourself, so trust me."
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.260]   So you had these priests who went and they studied it and they taught the Word of God.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.580]   They wouldn't allow it to be interpreted into common man's language, so you had to speak
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.940]   Latin.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.580]   And even if you did speak Latin, you had to have special permission even to touch it.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.420]   And anybody who tried to interpret it ended up getting executed.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:33.820]   So the whole Reformation was all of this corruption and bad doctrine came in because they wouldn't
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.680]   let us have the Word of God.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.220]   So the real point of the Reformation was to get the Bible to everybody.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.280]   Right?
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.060]   So that more people can examine the Word of God collectively, so that whatever doctrines
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.500]   that we hold onto is coming from a collective study of the Word of God.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.020]   That's systematic theology.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.180]   Right?
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.660]   So again, I want to caution you.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.980]   If you're not in the habit of systematically studying the Bible, do not sit and argue with
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.940]   people about secondary doctrines.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.940]   Okay?
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.820]   Does that make any sense?
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:08.980]   Right?
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:15.300]   Because if you do that, you're going to end up arguing your prejudice rather than Scripture.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.500]   So I'm not saying that if you're not doing it now, right?
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.540]   But if the conclusions that you came to is just because you happened to go to a certain
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.420]   church, or you read certain books, or you heard certain sermons, right?
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:32.060]   I would strongly encourage you to get in the habit of studying the Bible systematically
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.860]   first.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   Okay?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:42.940]   Historical theology is once you've come to the conclusion of exegesis, systematic theology,
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.580]   historical theology is, the Bible is not new.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.940]   We've had it for 2,000 years.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:53.980]   So the church fathers, these PhDs in theology, they've argued, struggled.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.420]   People have given their lives to stand up for certain doctrines.
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.500]   So it's not wise for us to ignore church history.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   Right?
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.060]   So historical theology basically is, what are the theologies that were passed down to
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   us?
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   Right?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.060]   What did they argue?
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.300]   What are some of the doctrinal statements that we have?
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.780]   The Apostles' Creed, the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Baptist Confession.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.180]   All of these confessions are things that we compare with, right?
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.540]   In light of the study, doctrines, systematic theology, and then we compare it with what
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.540]   they say.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.980]   So there is no doctrine that I'm aware of that has not been at one point argued in church
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.980]   history.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.180]   So, historical theology, right?
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:41.020]   Now the danger of starting at this point, if you grew up in a Presbyterian church, you're
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.740]   a Presbyterian the rest of your life.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.740]   You know?
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.660]   Not because you know what you believe, because that's what you're told.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.660]   Right?
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:54.180]   In fact, I know people who go to a Presbyterian church who are taught that if you marry anybody
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.620]   but a Presbyterian, you're compromising.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.620]   Right?
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.940]   And so they can't marry a Baptist, they can't marry anybody else, and you ask them why,
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.580]   because my pastor told me.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   Right?
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.700]   Same thing with Baptists.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.420]   I've met, you know, I was actually invited to a church in the Valley when they found
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.660]   out I'm a Baptist, the church said, "He can't come."
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   Right?
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.820]   And I asked them why, and they couldn't give me an explanation other than the fact that
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.820]   I'm a Baptist.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.820]   Right?
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.940]   Anyway, that's personal.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:28.300]   So historical theology is, we don't start there, but it's wise to compare.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.300]   Right?
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.900]   Wise to see what doctrines were argued and how they argued it and what passages they
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   used.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   Right?
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:40.140]   Different periods of church history emphasize certain doctrines over others.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:47.580]   So if you happen to be reading a lot of stuff that was written during the Reformation, what
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:54.980]   do you think was the primary thing that they were concerned about during the Reformation?
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.460]   What is a doctrine that they were arguing a lot about during the Reformation?
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.460]   Huh?
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.140]   >> Scripture, faith, and salvation.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.140]   >> Right.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.780]   That's basically what the Reformation was.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.300]   They were arguing against the Catholic Church that they were wrong.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   Right?
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:15.180]   Right doctrine of salvation, you know, Scripture, right view of Scripture, justification by
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.940]   faith, right?
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.940]   Not by works.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.420]   And so that was the predominant thing that they were concerned about.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:29.740]   If you go back in earlier church history, the first 700 years of church history, what
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.740]   do you think was the greatest doctrine that they wrestled over and discussed?
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.260]   Every time they had a church council, they discussed this one subject.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.820]   And almost for 700 years they did this.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.820]   Take a guess.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.820]   I think you can guess.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.020]   No?
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.780]   You can't guess?
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:36:01.180]   What do you think would have been the most important argument and discussion that they
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.740]   had for the first 700 years of church history?
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.420]   Christology.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.820]   Right?
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.620]   Doctrine of Christ.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.300]   Because the Bible taught and Jesus said certain things that they couldn't comprehend.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.060]   And so they were constantly arguing and discussing and wrestling over Scripture.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:25.940]   So if there's any one doctrine that has been just pounded and searched, every word dissected,
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.060]   it was Christology, the nature of who Jesus is.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   Right?
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.980]   So if you go back to church history, and you'll see divisions between the Catholic
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.860]   Church, the Nestorian, the Coptic Church, and you'll see all these divisions in the
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   church.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.340]   And if you go back into church history and find out what doctrine separated them, it
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.580]   usually was the doctrine of Christ.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:53.020]   That they were either one group was a modalist or a tritheist or Jesus was an eternal or
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.820]   he was kind of a gnostic figure.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:00.980]   So the first 700 years, they combed through every part of Scripture to debate this doctrine.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.700]   So it's beneficial for us.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.820]   So the doctrine that we have of Christ came from hundreds, even thousands of years of
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.740]   combing through every word, every verse.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.540]   So for us to come and think like, "Oh, I found something new that they didn't find
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.300]   for 2000 years," is probably, you know, a little bit prideful.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.740]   They probably argued it.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.740]   Right?
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:24.100]   In fact, when I was in Seminary, I was amazed.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:31.700]   I went and did a paper on, I don't know if you guys know, in Genesis chapter 6, they
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.700]   had the Nephilim.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.300]   Okay, so you guys know, you know who the Nephilims are, right?
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.700]   Okay, some of you know who the Nephilims are.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.980]   So I did just an obscure group of people that are mentioned in the book of Genesis.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.100]   And so I decided to do a paper on this.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.580]   And as soon as I decided to do this paper, I regretted it.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.660]   Because I thought, "How am I going to get material on this subject?
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.660]   Who cares?"
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.380]   You know, that's what I, I just picked it because that just seemed like, you know, I'm
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.740]   just curious, who are these people?
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.780]   So once I started doing the paper, I had to go to Fuller Seminary, and I have to go to
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:14.140]   Cal State Fullerton, all these major book libraries, even the secular libraries, to
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.800]   see if there's any material on the subject.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.860]   So the first school that I went to was Cal State Fullerton.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:27.100]   Because they have a storage of a lot of ancient theological, like, materials in that library.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.420]   Which is surprising to me, because it's a secular university, but they have it.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:34.700]   So I went there thinking, like, "Okay, maybe I'll find a couple chapters."
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.340]   So I went and looked up the Nephilims, and I found a whole wall.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:47.860]   Like, a whole wall of people writing about this subject, right?
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.640]   And the conclusion was, they didn't know.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.580]   That was the end conclusion, right?
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:57.860]   So I spent two months researching on the Nephilims, but you know what I learned from that was,
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:04.780]   for 2,000 years, there were people like me, who were much smarter, and had much more anal
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:12.380]   than me, who actually spent and did PhDs and doctoral papers on this subject, and they
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.940]   will give you 15 different views of how this was argued for 2,000 years, and the end conclusion
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.780]   was nobody knows for sure.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.540]   They're making an educated guess.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:30.260]   So what I learned from that was, every part of scripture has been dissected and argued
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.980]   and studied.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.820]   So there's nothing that we're studying that's just uniquely us.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:40.020]   So the point that I'm getting at is that for 2,000 years, the Word of God has been tested
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.700]   and dissected and argued.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.260]   And so the doctrines that you and I have today didn't just come to us.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.220]   It wasn't just some guy 40 years ago who all of a sudden discovers something new.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.340]   So whenever somebody says, "I have something new that they didn't know for 2,000 years,"
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   run.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.880]   Because that's probably not true.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.100]   That's usually how bad doctrines come from.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.340]   So that's where we get historical theology.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.740]   Philosophical theology is what I mentioned is, how do you make sense?
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.820]   Philosophical theology is when we apply philosophical reasoning to help us to better apply what
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.420]   we've learned from exegesis, systematic theology and historical theology.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:24.380]   So I'll just give you an example of, because the way I wrestled with the doctrine of Trinity,
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.580]   it came from my study of the Word of God.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:34.220]   And then when I started to get a broader understanding of the scripture, I began to realize it does
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.960]   teach the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.700]   So I used to shake in my boots every time a Jehovah Witness would come because their
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.380]   doctrine made more sense to me, until I knew what the Word of God says.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.180]   And then now I go to the Word of God and it just, they hit a wall.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.180]   Right?
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.180]   If we're talking philosophically, they make more sense.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.580]   But as soon as we open up the Bible, they hit a wall because there's a bunch of passages
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.380]   that they can't explain.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.300]   The way I came to this conclusion is, the Bible clearly teaches this.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.800]   When you collectively see it systematically, it teaches the doctrine of Trinity.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.940]   When you look at the doctrine of Trinity in church history, it was universally accepted,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.380]   right?
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.260]   As far as the mainstream is concerned.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.300]   And so how do I make sense of this?
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.700]   Which is what I was struggling with.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.180]   How can I embrace a doctrine that I can't even explain, my professors can't explain
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.260]   to me?
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.740]   So philosophically, so I've already concluded that that's what the Bible teaches.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:34.300]   And that's what the church historians have told me already, confirmed for me.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.500]   So how do I make sense of this doctrine of Trinity?
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.460]   And this is, again, this is the way I wrestled with it.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:49.140]   If God created me, it would make sense that God will always remain a mystery to a certain
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   degree.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   Right?
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.120]   And it would only make sense to me that I can't explain to you perfectly who He is.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.340]   Just like my children can't explain perfectly who I am.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.340]   Right?
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.540]   I know a lot more about them than they know about me.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.540]   Right?
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.540]   Because I raised them.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.540]   Right?
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.260]   And they know a lot about me that they don't know.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.340]   Because they showed up in my life when I was 30.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.100]   So there's 30 years of my life they haven't seen.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.340]   And then they weren't conscious until they were, what, 15?
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   So that's like, so 45.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.340]   Right?
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.740]   So 45 years they don't know.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.740]   Right?
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.780]   They only know the last 4 or 5 years.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.860]   So it made sense to me.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:33.400]   So if God created me, if God created me, it makes sense that there's an aspect of God
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.900]   that I can't fully comprehend.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.460]   I'm already convinced that's God's Word.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.660]   And so here's the way I reconcile that in my head.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.540]   Again, this isn't, this is just philosophical.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.540]   Right?
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:53.260]   If I told you, and let's say we don't have the word beautiful.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.180]   And we don't have anything even close to that.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.180]   Right?
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.900]   You know how there are certain things that, you know, a lot of you guys who are, or a
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.100]   lot of you guys at least bilingual enough, where you know that there are certain words
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.980]   that you cannot translate.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   Right?
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   You can't translate.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:12.460]   So I'm bilingual in Korean and English, so there's a word in Korean that I can't translate,
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.660]   and this word is "hankehae."
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.660]   Okay?
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.100]   Anybody know what that word means?
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.900]   Okay, maybe one person, okay?
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.500]   That word is uniquely Korean.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.180]   And you kind of have to grow up in the culture, and some of you guys, I'm guessing most of
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.940]   you guys probably don't know either.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.940]   Right?
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.860]   Because it took me a while to figure that out as well.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.300]   That's a word that if you don't know the culture, you don't know how it's being used, you don't
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:42.260]   know in what context it's being used, that there is not a word, there's no phrase that
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.180]   I can use in English to convey to you the meaning of that word.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180]   Right?
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.580]   So the only way that I can convey this to you is to use something like it.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.540]   It's kind of like, it's something good.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.700]   It's not bad, it's good.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.080]   It's kind of nostalgic.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.140]   It's kind of like spring.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:14.500]   Like after the rain, or you eat something tasty, and you get this warm, fuzzy feeling.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.540]   So that's the best way I can explain to you what that word means, because it's a very
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.780]   cultural word.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:26.460]   So you're going to have to go by how I explained it to you, because you're limited by what
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:31.900]   you're able to understand based upon your culture and your language and your limitation.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:36.140]   So when I'm trying to explain to you something that I know because of that culture, I have
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.060]   to, I have, I am limited by your limitation of how I can explain this to you.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.700]   Does that make sense?
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:49.580]   So when we talk about the things of God, there's things where we say, well God is sovereign,
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.460]   yet God says we're responsible.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.300]   God created us, and yet when Adam and Eve sinned, even though He's omniscient, they
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.860]   were punished.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.220]   So there's aspects of what the Word of God teaches that doesn't completely make sense
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.680]   to me, right?
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.900]   But the fact that it doesn't make sense to me, makes sense to me, to a certain degree,
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.520]   because I'm trying to comprehend the things of God.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:21.780]   So my conclusion was, obviously the philosophical theology is doing my best to try to understand
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.720]   something that can't be completely understood.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   But is that okay?
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.540]   Is that tension okay?
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:34.300]   And I, my conclusion was, not only was it okay, it makes sense that there's tension.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.080]   If there wasn't tension, I would be suspect, right?
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.080]   I would be suspect.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.900]   Now again, that may, that may seem like a lot of, you know, circular reasoning, but
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:47.180]   it makes perfect sense to me, right?
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.860]   But at the end of the day, God, the doctrines of the scripture are not written for the purpose
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.300]   of your knowledge of everything about God.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.460]   The doctrine, the scripture was written for the purpose of our salvation, to reveal to
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:01.460]   us.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.900]   So you see, exactly, when I tell my children about myself, I'm trying to tell them for
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   a particular reason.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.940]   Let's say I'm in the context of instructing them why you should choose this major over
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:16.480]   that major, and I'm explaining to them about my experience, what I went through, and why
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.180]   I'm giving you this advice.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.100]   I'm not explaining to him everything about who I am.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.700]   I'm explaining who I'm revealing myself to him, because I have a specific purpose of
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:33.100]   why I need him to understand that, so that he can go a certain direction.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:38.620]   Scripture was given to us for the purpose of salvation, to reveal to us who he is, and
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.540]   to draw sinners to himself.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:47.600]   So when he talks about the doctrine of sovereignty, he's not telling us how it works.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.880]   He's not telling us God's predestination, so let me tell you how it works.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.820]   So get out your calculator, you know, and we're going to make a graph, and you're going
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.180]   to figure out how this works.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.840]   When he talks about the doctrine of sovereignty and predestination, all he is saying is, "Trust
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   me."
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.960]   That's what he's saying.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.640]   I am sovereign God.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.040]   Nothing happens outside of my knowledge and my power.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.880]   There's, "Have I not said it?"
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.280]   "Shall I not do it?"
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.720]   So basically he's telling his people, "When I tell you to jump, you jump, because I'm
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   a sovereign God.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.320]   I predestined this."
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.080]   So there's a purpose of why he's saying it.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.200]   He's not saying it so that we can understand the intricacies of how predestination works,
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.360]   which we get caught up in.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   Right?
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.040]   And so I'm not saying that we shouldn't be curious or ask questions.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.560]   But philosophical theology is basically us trying to comprehend what was revealed in
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   Scripture.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.920]   So certain things are going to make sense, certain things may not make sense.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.600]   But if you start, if you study the Board of God and you come to a doctrinal position based
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:51.240]   upon this, you will be a Jehovah Witness if you have the courage enough to be one.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.040]   Because it makes more sense, philosophically.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.760]   But if you are a Biblicist, where you are studying the doctrine carefully, there are
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.320]   certain things that you're not going to be able to comprehend.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.320]   Right?
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.240]   So certain positions that I take, whether it is about women in ministry or homosexuality,
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.800]   that these are positions not based upon what I think makes the most sense, or what is going
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:17.240]   to make the most sense to the world, but what does the Bible say.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.440]   Which will always make us unpopular.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:25.560]   Because if they don't acknowledge the Word of God as with authority, and we're saying
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:30.120]   the only reason why I believe that is because the Word of God says so, then they're going
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.520]   to reject us.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.600]   Right?
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.080]   Because they don't give the same authority that it has.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:40.480]   So it doesn't make sense that our doctrines are always going to be acceptable to the world.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   They won't be.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.760]   There are certain things that God says because He's pointing out sin to the world, so they
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.680]   will repent and come back to them.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   Right?
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.480]   Alright, so again, I'm not going to—I went through most of my time talking about this.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   I'm going to go through the other one real quick.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.880]   So absolutely essential.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.360]   It needs to be in this order.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.960]   Exegesis, systematic theology, historical theology, philosophical theology.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:11.400]   I would encourage you to memorize this, so that whenever you get into this discussion
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   with people who are not basing it on Scripture, you remember.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.800]   Okay, I'm not arguing exegesis, I'm just arguing philosophically.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   Okay?
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.280]   The other part I'm just going to skim through.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.360]   Okay?
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.220]   If you're studying the Bible, you have to—these are all different contexts.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:32.480]   You have the passage you're looking at, what is the immediate context?
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.200]   This is kind of like the paragraph, right?
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.520]   And then the next section is the larger section, kind of like we're studying the Book of Romans,
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   right?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.040]   And as an example, Romans chapter 7, verse 13 to 25, that's the passage.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.040]   What does it mean?
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   Well, when you compare it with the immediate context, which is earlier chapter 7, chapter
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:57.400]   6, and chapter 8, so you have to view this passage in light of the larger context.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.860]   And then this larger context, well, what is Paul saying in the larger, major section?
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:06.580]   So in chapters 1 through 7, Paul is arguing, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.580]   of God."
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:12.340]   He's trying to reveal sin in order to bring chapter 8, "Oh, what a wretched man that I
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:17.460]   am, but thanks be to God, what the law could not do, weakened by the sinful flesh, God
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.340]   did by sending His Son in the Spirit."
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.280]   So he gives deliverance in chapter 8.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.880]   So the larger section, right?
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:31.160]   So Romans chapter 7, in the immediate section of chapters 6 and 8, larger section of chapter
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:39.120]   1 through 7, and then the book in Romans where the gospel is being taught, first 11 chapters
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   of doctrine of the gospel, and then chapter 12 through 16, talking about, "Therefore,
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.480]   present your body in view of the mercy of God, in view of everything that you've been
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.040]   taught, how you ought to apply all of this."
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.240]   Chapter 12 through 16.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.640]   So that's the book, the gospel message in totality, right?
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.300]   So whenever I study that passage, I have to have that in mind.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.360]   But it goes even further than that, right?
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:08.720]   So when we look at the things that Paul said in Romans, how does Paul use the word "law"
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   in his other books?
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.200]   When he says the word "love," what does he mean by that?
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.120]   How does he use that word, right?
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.640]   So there are certain things that I may say, if you know who I am, may mean something different,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   right?
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.120]   I never use the word "bomb."
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.480]   I'm not from that generation.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.600]   So if I say "bomb," I probably mean, "Get out of this sanctuary."
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.400]   That's what I mean, right?
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.680]   So if somebody much younger said it, it may mean, "It's cool."
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.060]   So you have to understand how that person uses that word.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.200]   So that's the larger context of the writer, right?
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   Who is he?
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.580]   What kind of language does he use?
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.760]   So that's the larger context.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.380]   And then the context outside of that is the New Testament.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.000]   So you have the Old Testament and New Testament.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.360]   You have the Old Covenant and the New Covenant.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.800]   So depending on what passage or what book you're looking at, you're going to have different
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.320]   covenants.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.480]   So how the Bible talks about the people of God sounds very different in the Old Testament
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.920]   versus the New Testament, right?
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:12.120]   How we understand the law, at least in view, where the law came to bring you to sin, and
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.460]   then law brought you to sin, and then now we have the law of Christ.
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.360]   So we have a New Testament context and an Old Testament context.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:27.000]   And then the larger part of that in the Bible, right, the context of the Bible is, what is
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.520]   the whole theme of the Bible?
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.520]   Redemptive history.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.600]   What we call the meta-narrative, the larger narrative, right?
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:47.940]   So the whole narrative of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is a holy God seeking His glory
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:50.340]   by redeeming sinful man.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.740]   That's the whole theme, right?
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.540]   So there is not a single book that's going to be written that is going to be contradicting
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   that theme.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.900]   Because God doesn't lie.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.700]   He doesn't contradict Himself.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.580]   So whatever study you're doing, you have to see it in the context of the larger picture.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.360]   So let me give you an example of that.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.540]   The book of Jonah, right?
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.820]   What is the purpose of the book of Jonah?
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:18.260]   Don't mess with God or you get swallowed up by a whale.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.620]   Right?
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.440]   Is that the message?
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.060]   You can say, yeah, don't mess with God.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.060]   God's a sovereign God.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.940]   I mean, you can get, you know, small lessons from that.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:27.940]   But what's the point?
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.180]   Why does He put that in this random story, right?
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.580]   And it's not even about Israel.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:39.760]   It's about, you know, a Jewish prophet who doesn't want to go to these Ninevites who
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.780]   in the long scheme of things, they're going to be judged and disappear.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.720]   Why is that in the Bible?
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Right?
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.240]   Well, if you look at the, if you study that book with the context of understanding in
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.400]   God's redemptive history, God called the nation of Israel to be what?
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.640]   A royal priesthood.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.920]   A holy nation.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   To declare His glory.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   Right?
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:09.040]   He calls Jonah, and He tells him to go, and Jonah doesn't want to go.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.680]   And why is he protesting?
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.880]   Because he doesn't want them to be saved.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.720]   He gets angry when they get saved.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.880]   And then how does the book end?
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.000]   Why do you care?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.920]   These people who can't tell from the left or to the right that I show mercy to them.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   The end.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.200]   That's how it ends.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   Right?
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.440]   So, what was the point?
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.160]   The nation of Israel forgot their calling.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.920]   They were there enjoying themselves and going to temple worship, but He said, "No, I want
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.120]   you to go and declare My glory to them."
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.760]   And He didn't want to go.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.560]   So the whole point about the book of Jonah was in God's redemptive history, the nation
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.080]   of Israel was called to declare His glory, and Israel forgot their calling.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   Right?
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.760]   So, if you don't see that in the light of the larger picture of redemptive history,
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:02.120]   the meta-narrative, it just becomes about the whale.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.320]   Right?
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.400]   Don't mess with the whale or you get eaten up.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   Right?
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   It's the end.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.440]   And you get a nice moral story for Sunday school, but you kind of miss the larger picture.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.720]   So again, every passage has to be within the context of the larger genre.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.240]   I'm not going to talk about it because Pastor Mark's going to talk about it next week.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   Okay?
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.200]   So, those of you guys who are anal have to fill this out.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   You can fill this out right now.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   Okay.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   Do it quick.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:45.080]   Don't worry about penmanship because I'm not going to give you time.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   Clear yet?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Unique theology.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:56:03.880]   Book.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.200]   Purpose of the book.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   Major section.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   Sections by theme.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   Pastor Mark, maybe you should start coming up.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.300]   [SILENCE]
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.920]   Pastor mark, we should start coming up.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.820]   [SILENCE]
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.320]   OK.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:37.780]   [SILENCE]
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.280]   OK.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:51.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:57:01.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
