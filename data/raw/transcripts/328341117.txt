[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   Okay, we'll take a moment to begin, and I know that it's a long passage. You guys
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.080]   probably had lots to talk about. It's tough to get through everything, but I'm
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   praying that since we are essentially covering it in different modes, right? You
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.680]   at your home, when you're looking at the passage, asking questions and making
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.200]   observations, then coming together you get different perspective a little bit
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.320]   in the sense that people are watching and paying attention to different parts
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.500]   of the text, and it really does help you see more things from the passage. And I
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.920]   hope that this will just be another avenue of that. I can't cover everything
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.880]   and I wish I did, but because this is such a pivotal passage to the
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.140]   general thought of transformation, to the general thought of changing in the
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.520]   maturity of Christ. And as you guys know, I love biblical counseling, wanting to
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.640]   walk through biblical passages with people, and these passages that
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240]   we walked through in the last couple weeks, and particularly this passage, is
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.040]   so pivotal to everything in terms of biblical counseling, right? What is
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.560]   biblical change? How do you change? And all that kind of stuff. So we're gonna
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.960]   take a moment to pray, ask the Lord's blessing, and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.480]   Let's pray. God, we want to thank you for your grace. Thank you, Lord, for your
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.560]   sweet word. Thank you so much, God, that in your love for us, you continue to
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   instruct us. What's more, God, we thank you so much because we read in your word
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.560]   that it is clearly your will and your design that we would reflect you. Lord,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.400]   God, that we would be changing from measure to measure, from statue to
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.120]   statue, Lord God, that we'd be changing into your likeness. And we want to thank
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.600]   you so much for that, Lord. We thank you, God, that you lead us and guide us, and we
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.000]   pray that you grant to us eyes to see, ears to hear, and a heart always willing
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.400]   to learn. We thank you. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. So as we jump into this
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.600]   passage, a really quick, quick review is necessary because the verse stands with
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.280]   "and." Starts with "and," sorry. Starts with "and." If you recall, this is only the
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   second half of the previous section. Now, in order to review, I want to start with
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.280]   verse 1 of chapter 3. And the idea there is the whole of this entire section from
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.760]   verse 1 to verse 17, it is talking about the applicational push. Everything we
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.680]   have learned in the past is pushing us here in chapter 3 to apply, to put into
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.920]   practice, and therefore to actually change. The gospel that we believe is
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.680]   absolutely transformative, and Apostle Paul is pushing us towards that. And the
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.120]   way I'm gonna put it is he's pushing us towards maturity. First and foremost, he's
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.440]   pushing us towards maturity in thought. Okay? In thought. Why do I say that?
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.880]   Because that passage in verses 1 through 4, chapter 3, verse 1 through 4, says,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.520]   "Therefore, if you've been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.240]   and not on the things that are on earth." Right? And so the command is very clear
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.680]   that it involves your mind, that you constantly place it on the things that are about
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.080]   Christ, of Christ. If you recall, that's exactly what he's been doing since chapter 1.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.600]   He said, "I want you to have full knowledge, come to full wisdom, full
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.360]   understanding." He said, "I want you to understand who you have. You have the
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.840]   maker, you have the sustainer, you have all, all in all. And therefore, I want you
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.760]   to know you're complete. I want you to know that you've been circumcised
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.160]   spiritually. I want you to know you've been baptized. I want you to know what you have
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   in Jesus." That was chapters 1 through 3 pretty much, right? Or chapter 1 and 2.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.840]   Secondly, Apostle Paul and the Lord desires us to have mature humility.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.600]   The blank there is humility. Now you could put in other words summarizing this idea,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.720]   but the last portion that we studied, the command for us was to put away, to lay
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.320]   aside and trash all the things that was ignoble. And he says, "Therefore consider
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.240]   the members of your earthly body dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desires,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.960]   and greed, which amounts to idolatry." So that was verses 5 through 9, telling us
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.600]   that we have to have a level of humility to look inside ourselves, be
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.960]   introspective, and be able to identify those things that are evil. Those desires
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.880]   that are corrupt, those things that are greedy, and therefore, idolatrous. I think
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.480]   this is sometimes a major error that we have. A major error which is this. In
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   terms of maturity, sometimes we think maturity comes by way of skill,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.560]   accomplishment. I've studied, I got my A, then I got to get a job, and da-da, I'm
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.520]   here, right? Skill has nothing to do necessarily with maturity. As a matter of
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.080]   fact, I find it kind of humorous that in our generation, we make this mistake
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.280]   quite often, especially in just sports, the arena of sports. You have an
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   athlete, he's huge, it's surprising to me, a lot of you guys probably watch some
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   college football. Every time I watch college football, I'm like, "That guy
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.880]   cannot be under 22. He looks like he's 30." I mean, the individuals are big, large, and
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.120]   strong, and all that kind of stuff, and some of them can do quite, I'm sorry,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.800]   quite amazing stuff. And then, therefore, people go in and ask them like questions
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   about life. "Do you think da-da-da-da-da? Do you think we should vote for whoever and
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.600]   whoever?" It's like, "The guy's not a politician. He throws a basketball, right?" But we make
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.560]   this flawed, erred kind of assessment of what is maturity. Maybe because they're
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   really well-known, or whatever it may be. Maturity oftentimes comes by our ability
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.560]   to see and identify reality as is. To see that there are certain things within us
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.920]   that needs to be corrected. Now, the third one is going to be mature love, and
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.320]   that's what we're tackling today. Mature love. That the character traits, such as
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.920]   selfishness, and immorality, and greed, and all this kind of stuff, is immature
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.680]   because they're unloving. And what is mature is when I can actually trust you
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.760]   in your love for somebody else. If I tie the two together, the mature humility and
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   mature love, an individual who may be very skilled, knowledgeable, theologically
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.160]   astute, and doctrinally sound, and all that kind of stuff, he may be all
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.720]   that, he may be all of that, but that does not mean I am willing to place people I
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.880]   love in his hands. Right? Because he has to show his ability to garner that kind
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.200]   of trustworthiness through the maturity of his love. If he cared and loved books,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.680]   but cared nothing for people, I'm not gonna trust you with people. That's just
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   the way it goes. Right? Now, part of the reason why I've set all this up is
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.400]   because, again, the major push. We're gonna feel through these passages this
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.640]   challenge and exhortation for us to put on new thoughts, new attitudes, and new
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.680]   behaviors. And that naturally is going to, therefore, then cause us to do both
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.480]   automatically. Both to put off the stuff that we've been already doing, and put on
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.440]   the things that God wants us to put on. And it also naturally humbles us. Because
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.280]   the obvious statement is, you're not as mature as you should be. Right? There's so
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.880]   much room to grow. There's so much more we should be striving for. Now, with that
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.900]   said, let's jump into the passage and make observations specifically of the
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:10.840]   various passages. Okay? So as you take a look at this, let's read down here. And
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.800]   then, again, I'm gonna try to blaze through some portions of this. And then
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.440]   we'll see how far we can get. In this very first section, what we find is in
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.320]   verse 10 through 11, this is what he says, "And I've put on the new self who is
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the one who
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.880]   created him. A renewal in which there is no distinction between
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.640]   Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.120]   and free man, but Christ is all and in all." Okay? So what I'm gonna say is this.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.680]   Verse 10 and 11 belong together. And essentially, the command is very clear.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.040]   "Put on the new self." So what you should have done is highlighted, and I'm gonna
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.440]   highlight in purple, the command. I typically always highlight the commands
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.320]   because those are imperatives that you can meditate on and you can seek to try
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.740]   and apply. How do I make sure I apply this? I don't want to miss it. But what's
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.960]   also very interesting is he says, "Put on this new self." And the way I'm gonna say
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.280]   that the reason why verse 10 and 11 belong together is because it's an
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.160]   introduction of what this new self is. Because as soon as we see this, we should
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.200]   be asking ourselves this question. And what is that question? That question
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.160]   simply should be, "How is this new self described in verse 10 through 11?" Okay?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.400]   And what you'll find is that here, as you guys have maybe seen this before with
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   the diagramming stuff, I blocked it off this way, and at least I indented it, not
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.240]   just because I love grammar, but because it shows a flow of thought. All it's
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   doing is this pronoun "who" is describing this new self. Right? My artistic skills
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.840]   are improving? That is an arrow. Okay. Alright. Who is describing the new self?
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.600]   And what's more, this new self is clearly being renewed. And it also gives you this
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.160]   idea here, this preposition "to," it also gives us a directional force. What are
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.800]   you being renewed to? Okay? And you're being renewed to the knowledge, or true
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.120]   knowledge. Now, here it says, "According to the image of the one who created him." And
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.080]   all I'm gonna say really briefly is this is describing this whole process. You are
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:43.200]   being renewed to the true knowledge according to the image of the one. You
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.720]   are progressively being renewed, you are progressively being changed and
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.560]   transformed to the image of Christ. And if you think about it, the connection is,
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.120]   and that's why you should let go of all the stuff that was before. The commands
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.480]   for us to put off immorality, impurity, and all that kind of stuff, and do not
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.800]   lie to each other. And it says, "Since you have put aside the old self,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.280]   and you have already put on this new self in Christ, and you are being renewed
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:20.640]   to his image." Right? So the whole idea is your past life absolutely incompatible
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.480]   with the progress that God is doing in you. You've heard this many times, that
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.600]   you are in a sanctifying process right now. Right? God's will is that there is
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.840]   active, step-by-step, progressive change in you. And all the things of the past is
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:44.360]   incompatible with that plan of God. Now here, I want to make mention of this
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.240]   concept here, which is the true knowledge. Okay? This is the true knowledge, this is
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.960]   the image of the one. And so what I'd like to quickly make mention of is
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.280]   this. So if we're talking about this idea that you should be putting on this new
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   self, and there is this process of change, and you're supposed to be letting
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.160]   go of bad, evil practices from before, whether it be lying and all that kind of
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.480]   stuff, can we ask the question that if you are doing stuff that is inconsistent
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.280]   with Jesus, if you are doing things that you know are of greed or of evil
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   thoughts, then can we say that your understanding of Jesus is off? You know
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:32.640]   what I'm asking? Here is your action on one hand, I see it, you lied. Here is the
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.240]   intent and the content of your mind. Can we assume that your mind and your heart
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:48.440]   is off? And the answer is yes. Okay? What I mean by that is, listen, the truth that
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.200]   we believe absolutely matters. It is the foundation of our change. The things that
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.920]   we believe about Jesus, His world, His will, all of these things matter because
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.040]   who He is, what He's done in the gospel, and His plans for you in the future, all
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:09.160]   those things change your behavior. What you believe and what you see absolutely
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.000]   change your behavior. It does. If you are messing around, kicking a box, jumping on
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.240]   a box, and everyone thinks like, "Oh, you're having a grand old time," you're
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.960]   perfectly fine. There's nothing going on in your heart. You have no bad emotions.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.200]   You're just happy. If I tell you, "Oh my goodness, my dog was in there," now all of
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.400]   a sudden you're guilty, you're stopped, you automatically immediately stop. How
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.000]   you are thinking and what you find out will absolutely change how you behave.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.200]   Now, someone might think, "Hey, isn't that just like cognitive behavioral science
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   and psychology?" Well, here's the idea. For us as believers, the content of your
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.480]   mind must be full on Christ. The truth and revelations that's changing you must
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.520]   be this full understanding, the true knowledge of Christ. That's what's
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.760]   radically changing you. Okay, so now let me kind of bring this together and
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.720]   share a convicting point about this. If you guys notice, I made sure to kind of
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.160]   highlight for you that sometimes we see certain actions, and then can we judge
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.320]   the heart? Can we judge the mind? Can we judge what we're thinking? And my answer
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:27.680]   to you was yes. Can I be honest with you? Typically, typically, I am incredibly
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   defensive of my heart. Let's say I was caught in a lie. Let's say somebody I
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.160]   love caught me in a lie, like my wife or my kids or my pastor or you guys, you
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.360]   know, like whoever is close to me come and say, "Oh my goodness, you lied about
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.320]   that, right?" You know what I'm gonna do? Typically, my flesh is gonna be like, "Oh, I
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.360]   know I did, but I had this thingy and this happened, but my intent was to
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   really actually preserve you and not to hurt you, and that's why I lied. So inside,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.600]   it was all gold, but then what came out was dirty stuff. I don't know how that
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   happened." You know, like that would be typically what I would say in defense
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:12.160]   of my mind and heart. Here's a question to you. The reason why I make—the reason
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.440]   why I make a point of this is because what we have contained in our mind and
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.640]   our heart, we have to be humble about. And the challenges that we're receiving
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.800]   from this passage, we have to be ready to receive with those humble hands. If you
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.200]   turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4, Apostle Paul says the exact same thing
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:40.160]   that he says here, okay? Ephesians chapter 4, verse 22 to 24. And look at what he
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:49.920]   says about the renewing of our minds. He says this, "In reference to your former
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.320]   manner of life, you lay aside the old self which is being corrupted in
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.840]   accordance to the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.000]   your mind and put on the new self which is in the likeness of God, has been
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.600]   created in righteousness and holiness of truth." So I want you to think about what
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.840]   he says right there. He says, "Putting aside this former manner of life, it has
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.160]   all these lusts and deceits." And what needs to happen is you need to be
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.280]   renewed in the spirit of your mind. And therefore, you're designed to all the
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.040]   more put on the righteousness of God. And you're doing what the Ephesians—in the
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.600]   book of Ephesians chapter 5—says, you're imitating and copying after God. What I'm
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:38.240]   saying is this, there was a wise, wise pastor who once said—this wise pastor is
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.760]   Pastor Peter Kim, okay? A lot of the wise things that I've learned, I've learned
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.840]   from him. There was this one time where he said, "You know, sometimes we're so
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.360]   defensive of like the condition of our heart and wondering, 'Hey, am I
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.760]   compromised or not? Did I do something that was compromising?'" It was really
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.120]   interesting. He said, "You know, most of the time it's not even a matter of if, it's
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.920]   how much." And I went, "Oh, man." You know, like, it's deep. All of our hearts to some
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.320]   degree are compromised. If you're gonna sing that like child song, which is
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.960]   positionally true, right? Like, "The reason I know, He saved my soul,
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:22.520]   'cause I dug deep down and I found pure gold." I'm not sure if I can sing that now
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.320]   that I'm older and I've seen my heart. Honestly, right? I dug deep down and said,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.280]   "Oh, I don't want to sing it. I don't want anybody to see this." You know, like,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   because there's so much that's already there. I didn't realize. What I'm saying
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   is this. We need the humility to admit, as the challenge is being said, you need to
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.600]   be renewed in your mind and you're being conformed to the true knowledge of God,
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.760]   that even the intent and the content of our minds, there is already levels of
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.880]   things, filth, lust, deceit, and error that need to be corrected. And if we have this
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.840]   defensiveness where we're like, "Yeah, no, my actions, I can see how that looks
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.200]   bad, but then inside my heart it's really gold," you're never gonna get anywhere.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.240]   You're not gonna have the motive and the conviction to put on the
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.760]   things that God is challenging us to put on. Why do I say this? It's because, take a
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.000]   look at this. This renewal, okay, so boom boom boom, right? This renewal of the new
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.460]   self, the true knowledge, the image of the one in this renewal has no distinction.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:33.000]   That's weird. You should be asking the question, "Huh? Why?" Why would he start
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.840]   talking about this distinction? Why does this matter? If I ask the
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.640]   question, what is the point here? What's the statement here? All he's saying is,
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   "Hey guys, there is a list of various things you need to put on. These things
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.000]   include conditions of the heart, mentalities, attitudes, and you need to
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.960]   put on love, loving desire for the other people," right? All that kind of stuff. But
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.560]   then he says, "All that stuff you need to put on, everybody needs to put it on."
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.920]   That's the point, right? Doesn't matter who you are. We all got to wear the same
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.600]   uniform. That's the point of that passage there. But I also again want to give a
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.440]   quick, quick convicting point, which is this. If it's simply the point that all
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.160]   of us have to put this on, why does he name these individuals? The Greeks, the
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.600]   Jews, the circumcised, the uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free. You
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.400]   should have been asking, "Who in the world are the Scythians?" Because I don't know.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.680]   We don't normally use this name. And who are the barbarians? Because man, I'd be
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.160]   offended right now, right? You should be asking, "Who are these people? Why does he
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.520]   name them? And how does it connect to all of us need to wear the same uniform?"
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.040]   Because this is true. Here's a challenge to you. Whenever you study the scripture,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.200]   start to meditate, and when you meditate, picture it. I want you to picture a Greek
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.600]   and a Jew sitting in the same church across the table from each other, and
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.380]   think about how awkward that could be, right? When maybe before Christ, they
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.680]   would not walk in the same road. They would not walk through the same city.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.320]   Think about the circumcised and uncircumcised. It is the same distinction,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.080]   but you guys have probably heard before. The circumcised considered the
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.320]   uncircumcised absolutely filthy dogs. And then picture barbarian Scythians, and
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:32.760]   then slaves and freemen sitting in the same church. Mmm, now we're getting
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.600]   somewhere. You think some of them had reasons why they would resist putting
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.840]   this stuff on? If the pastor of the church said, "I want you today this
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.200]   morning, after we have this great worship, please turn to each other and
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.400]   greet each other," and there would just be awkwardness, like crazy, like, "Hey, look,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.960]   snacks!" You know, like, and you start going because you don't want to have awkward
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.460]   greeting time. Why? Because the guy sitting next to you used to be a slave
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:03.700]   driver, right? Used to actually own people. And I was kind of thinking, like, in our
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.980]   day, what would be, you know, kind of indicative and apropos to that kind of
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.540]   comparison? I don't know, imagine if you had a horrendous dating experience and
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.460]   across the table from you was your ex, and you're like, "But that's my ex, you know? It's
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.460]   my ex-girlfriend. How awkward!" Now, don't start looking at each other and don't
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.500]   start pointing fingers, okay? Because I'm not talking about any one particular
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:33.860]   individual. I'm just asking you to imagine, do you think people had valid
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.220]   reasons, at least they thought in their head, why they didn't want to apply some
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.780]   of this stuff? Probably. And then there's a convicting point for you and I, right?
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   In our day and age, we live in an incredibly peaceful society where the
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:55.500]   worst enemies perhaps might be some exes, you know? But then, if a potential ex,
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.540]   whoever, an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend was like, "Apostle Paul, I don't know if I
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.300]   can put on compassion, kindness, and gentleness right now." And Apostle Paul
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:11.660]   would look at you and say, "Dude, I just told that slave." Yeah? "I just told that slave
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:18.780]   and that master to go talk to each other." That's pretty convicting. And we need to
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:24.940]   recognize that because this letter has its actual circumstance and context of
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.740]   people coming together in the name of Christ and he says, "Christ is all in all.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:37.660]   There is no distinction." That's why that's there. Okay? So, introduction, already
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.180]   pretty heavy stuff. Pretty challenging stuff. That we need to put on the new
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:48.900]   self. We are progressively being renewed to the image of the One, our
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.980]   Lord, and that there is no distinction. That this is a command for every single
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.780]   one of us. And we have to have that humility to accept it. Now, because of
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:05.620]   this portion here in verse 12, he says, "So, as those who have been chosen of God,
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.860]   holy and beloved." Okay? We're gonna move on to this little section. And this
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:18.900]   actually, to me, three, I guess, identifiers of who you are. Right? That's all it is.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.220]   You can just put in there that these are three IDs of who you are. Now, what's
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:32.620]   really interesting about this is that he's offering to us the rationale.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.580]   If before there was perhaps a rationale as to potentially like combat why the
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.980]   individuals wouldn't obey those commands, he is giving us then here. If you need
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:49.380]   reason, look at this. You're chosen of God, you're holy, and you're beloved. Now, for
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.780]   the sake of time, I'm just gonna identify this as this. You knowing who you are is
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:24:00.020]   powerful. Yes? Right? I'm not sure how many of you guys have seen those movies
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.540]   where it's so silly. Like, they're getting beat up by the villain. These
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.820]   individuals are like lost. They don't know what they're doing. And all of a
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.260]   sudden, some guy has to scream at them. I'm thinking of four, okay? If you guys
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.800]   remember, I'm not sure if you saw the movie, it was like, "Who are you?" And he's like, "I'm the
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.780]   "God of thunder." And all of a sudden it's like, "Brrrr." Everybody dies. Right? It's like, that's just how it is. Your
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:26.660]   identity is incredibly powerful. It's funny in the movies, but the reality in
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.260]   Jesus is incredibly powerful. Okay? Now, I'm just saying, I'm just gonna leave it
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.940]   at that, and I'm gonna ask you this question for your discussion. These
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:44.220]   specific identities, the chosen of God, holy and blessed, this is pretty huge. But
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.460]   the question you have to ask is, how does that motivate and provide this
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.180]   rationale, base, and reason for me to do everything that follows? How does that
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.460]   empower me? Why is it so important that I know I'm chosen, that I know I'm holy
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.100]   because of Christ, and that I'm beloved of God? Why? Why is that so important? Why
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.420]   does it matter to this process of change? That's what you need to ask. Okay? I'm
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.140]   gonna leave that for your discussion, because it's super important. Alright? And
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.340]   if some of you guys have ever had a Thor experience, share it with your group.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.380]   Encourage everybody. And the lightning came out of your eyes. No, I'm just kidding.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:25.300]   Alright. Next section, alright? So I'm gonna draw a line here, because here is
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.780]   the command. So sometimes, if you remember the way I do it is, okay, that first
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:38.420]   section took me 24 minutes. Alright. The way I do it sometimes is, I just
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.220]   build the sections that I'm studying based on the actual command verse, right?
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.060]   Especially in a section like this where you know it's applicational. Well, here, he
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.900]   repeats the idea, so you know he's changing gears again and saying, "Put on,"
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.620]   and what he is doing is simply giving you the details and the specific pieces.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:01.860]   If you are to wear the clothes of Christ, so to speak, here are all the pieces. Now,
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.420]   I cannot go through every single one of these, but let's just read it first, and
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:13.820]   then let's highlight a few. Okay? First, "Put on a heart of compassion, kindness,
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.940]   humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving each
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:24.740]   other, whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord forgave you. So
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   also should you. Beyond all these things, put on love, which is the perfect bond of
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:37.260]   unity." Man, we could just camp out here and just go for forever, but this is what
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.380]   I'm gonna do, okay? If you recall that encouragement, especially when there is a
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.240]   laundry list of terms, but these terms happen to be loaded terms, you know
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   they're big, it's important for you to do word studies, right? Word studies. And one
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:27:01.780]   of the things that I use, oh no, is not that, okay? It's blueletterbible.com.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:11.220]   Now what I'm gonna show you is here, Colossians 3 verse 12 in the NASB, okay?
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:16.540]   blueletterbible.com, and it's awesome because here, look, you have these verses
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:22.620]   and it asks you, "Do you want tools?" And I'll say, "Yes, I want them tools." And look at
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.620]   all those tools it gives me. It gives me Bibles, cross-references, commentaries,
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.420]   dictionaries, and miscellaneous. But this is why I really like it, it's because it
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.740]   makes it so easy. He says, "There's all the words individually broken down, of God,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:41.020]   holy, beloved, put on a heart of compassion." So what I'll do is actually
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:48.500]   look at this and I'll try to pronounce the word, splagnon. And then, remember how
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.620]   Pastor Peter talked about the Strong's numbers? You click on that guy and it
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.420]   gives you a bunch. It gives you the pronunciation, I can even listen to it if
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:04.340]   I want to, but then the important part is just the definition. It's probably here,
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:10.700]   it means your bowels and your intestines. Interesting that we call it heart, right?
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.660]   But it gives you the definition here that the bowels are regarded as a seat
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.700]   of the more violent passion, such as anger and love. The Hebrews had this as a
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:27.420]   seat of tender affections. That's pretty awesome. I get to see the definitions and
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.220]   I get to see the lexicon of like the different ways it's used and what's more,
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.180]   I can see also where concordance, where else it was used. Pretty interesting, right?
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:42.260]   If I go back, just go back to this portion right here when I was looking at
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.500]   it, the heart of compassion, I could actually just click heart.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.940]   And what that will do is it'll give me pretty exhaustive concordance. Now I can
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.900]   look from Genesis all the way down. Pretty cool tool, huh? Now, some of you
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.180]   guys might not have the time to go through every single word, that's fine.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.420]   Just use the words that you know you just haven't studied very much. For
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.260]   example, if you're thinking about something like heart of compassion or I
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.500]   like the idea of kindness here. Why? Because I'm thinking kindness and maybe
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   you're maybe kind of like me. I don't have a whole big range of emotions. I'm
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.540]   watching sports, I'm just like, "Oh cool." They lose, I'm like, "Oh man." Some, you
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.500]   know, some guys are livid, they're just like, "Oh my gosh!" Right? I just don't have
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.940]   a huge range of emotions and I'm sitting here thinking, when I hear, "Oh be
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:35.220]   kind," I'm like, "Oh man, what if I don't know how to do that?" You know? What if I
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.380]   don't know how to show that emotion of like, "Aww, are you hurting?" Like, I just
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:45.620]   don't know how. It just gets awkward, right? Maybe you're like me. Now, so you're
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.020]   thinking, "I don't know how to apply this." Well, sometimes learning the ideas behind
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:57.900]   it really helps. Is kindness thought of in the Bible as, "Aww, are you hurting?" Is that
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.380]   kind of compassion and kindness like, "Hello!" Like everything's just super daisy
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.100]   and super sweet and all like joyous and all that kind of stuff. Is that the way
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.540]   the Bible is picturing this? Here's something really interesting. You look up
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.660]   the definition and it thinks it's more on the lines of moral goodness and
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:21.740]   integrity. What? That's interesting. Here's Strong's definition, "usefulness." The way
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.740]   that the Bible most frequently, the definitions that come first are the more
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.700]   frequent uses. The way that the Bible more frequently uses the idea of kindness
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:37.220]   is knowing that your heart is good. That if I entrust myself to you, I know you
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.180]   will do me good. Why? Because you're a man of integrity. Because you're kind in that
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:48.300]   way. You're useful. You're constantly seeking to be helpful, to be of their
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.060]   good. That your intention is not to take advantage of them. Your intention is not
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.740]   to tease them, make fun of them, and have a good laugh at their expense. But no,
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.340]   your constant thought is, "I'm gonna try to protect you. I'm gonna be trying to be good
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:06.220]   to you. I'm gonna be integrate. I'm gonna have integrity with you." That's kind. And
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:13.500]   then I think, "Oh, okay!" Right? I can have a better picture of what kindness means.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.140]   Now, I'm gonna stop it there because we don't have time to go through every
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:23.220]   single word. My challenge for you is, if there are certain terms, like I said,
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.620]   you're like, "I don't know how to apply that though." Start looking at the general
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.180]   concepts of the Bible. However, I want to give a caveat. Do not look at a Bible
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:38.620]   dictionary. Look at 15 different, you know, they call them glosses, the entries,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.100]   the definitions that you see within the entry, right? And then be like, "Ooh, that
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.360]   sounds really good. I'm gonna pick that one." You can't do that, okay? You have to
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.060]   first get the general feel of how this is used generally through the Bible. Then
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:58.820]   reread it in your text so that you know, in context, how is this being used. The
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.420]   tough part about this context is it's a laundry list of things you should do. So
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:09.300]   what should you do? Well, I have a challenge for you. Think about how
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:15.940]   the concept is being perceived. How is every one of these concepts being
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:22.620]   perceived? I'll give you a hint, just as the Lord. You are to think about these
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:30.500]   concepts as they exist in the perfections of Christ. You are to think
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.980]   about these concepts as in the perfections of Christ. You should be
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:42.540]   reflecting, "How has the Lord?" Because who do you know? Who do you know who is
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:47.340]   compassionate in heart, kind, humble, gentle, patient, bearing with
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.660]   everybody, forgiving each other? Like, who do you know who's all of these things to
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.420]   its perfection? I could name a few of you who are like outstanding in
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.720]   several of these areas. None of us have these to perfection. Now, what's
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:07.340]   challenging for us though, is you take a concept like patience. And the
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.420]   reason why I picked this is because our pastors have been talking about it. Like,
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.860]   just in our past meeting, we were just like, "The Lord is so crazy patient. It's
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:25.020]   crazy." We're so astounded by how patient God is. Why? Because some of you
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:32.260]   have been Christian for a long time. You know? You have. And therefore, I'm willing
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:38.980]   to bet you have had repetitive seasons of not being sober, and being sober, and not
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.540]   being sober, and being sober. And lately we've been talking a lot about drifting
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.100]   and stuff like that. And if you've been Christian for a certain extent, there is
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.460]   probably even a frustration with yourself. "Why am I so susceptible to
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:34:01.020]   getting lost?" Right? Now, I want you to think about that for a moment. Whatever
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:07.500]   frustration you feel about yourself, God actually has the right to feel about you.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:14.820]   Were he not perfectly patient with you? Were he not so understanding, sympathetic,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:20.100]   and compassionate with you? And what's wild to me is I've been walking through
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.060]   the book of Romans with the high school students, and I came across this passage
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.500]   and it just like blew me away. I was floored. Why? Romans chapter 9 through 11,
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.380]   theologically thought of as the section on what about the Jews? What's the plan
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.340]   of God for the Jewish people and the Gentile people? What gives? Are they all
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.660]   gonna die? Are they gonna be saved later on? What's gonna happen? I don't think
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:47.420]   that's the point. It's the question. It's not the point. The question starts off,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.180]   "What about the Jews?" And Apostle Paul says, "I wish I could be a curse for them. I
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.260]   want to save them." Right? And then they start complaining, "Well, is it our fault?
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:00.580]   Did God tell us?" And Apostle Paul's like, "You all heard! You killed all the prophets,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.180]   remember?" You know? And then it just weirdly keeps going. Like, the people ask
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   questions like, "But you're sovereign, then how come you blame us? And how come, you
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.260]   know, you blame us for this and that?" And there's just this accusation and
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.000]   accusation. And I want to read you an interesting passage. Amidst all the
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.780]   complaints of, "How come, you know, you blame us when you didn't tell us? How
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:26.360]   come it was unfair?" And yada yada yada. Romans chapter 10 verse 19 to 21, just
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.260]   listen to this. He says, "But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they?" So that's
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.060]   that question. Like, "Israel didn't know about it?" And he says, "First, Moses says, 'I
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.980]   will make you jealous by that which is not a nation. By a nation without
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:45.680]   understanding, I will anger you.'" God had to bring hard affliction to get them to
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.140]   understand. Verse 20, "And Isaiah is very bold and says, 'I was found by those who
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:56.860]   did not seek me. I became manifest to those who did not ask for me.'" Verse 21,
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:03.420]   "But as for Israel, he says, 'All the day long I stretched out my hands to a
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:11.940]   disobedient and obstinate people.'" God, there's an amazing picture of God being
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:21.140]   so patient with us that he's stretching out his arm all day long. Gonna be honest,
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:27.500]   if my kid doesn't take what's in my hand in a matter of seconds, I might lose it.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:37.220]   Yes? God's perfect patience is incredible with us. For generations upon
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:43.780]   generations of people making constant excuses and sometimes, and sometimes
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:48.460]   pointing the finger right back at him saying, "It's your fault." God has
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:55.260]   stretched out his gracious hands all day long. That's pretty incredible if you
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.700]   think about it. How are we to think about these concepts we're supposed to think
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.300]   about in the perfections? And Apostle Paul says this, "Yet for this reason I
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:10.460]   found mercy so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:15.100]   demonstrate his perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:20.040]   him for eternal life. Now to the eternal King Immortal, invisible, the only God, be
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:28.700]   honor and glory forever and ever. Amen." Okay? Sometimes we need to do that. Where
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:34.180]   we take a certain word, we look at where the references are, and we see, "Where are
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.900]   these references sometimes used of God? How is the character of God manifest
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:45.340]   through these collection of terms?" Okay? Alright. Then the last final section, and
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:52.260]   then we're done. This next section, verses 15 through 17, reads like this.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:59.260]   "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.780]   in one body, and be thankful. Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.900]   all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another, with psalms and hymns and
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.380]   spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:15.620]   Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:20.300]   thanks through him to God the Father." Okay? What I've done for you there for
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:26.420]   the sake of time is, I noticed that there is a pattern where it talks about an
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.300]   element of Christ, whether it be his peace, whether it be his word, whether it
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:38.580]   be his name. Okay? His peace, his word, or his name. And all of these things are
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:45.620]   supposed to affect you deeply, either by way of ruling in your hearts, dwelling in
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:52.620]   you, or actually encompassing everything. And what that's supposed to produce is
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:59.380]   various. It's supposed to produce a one body. It's supposed to produce this kind
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:05.620]   of admonishing one another with psalms and singing. Whoops, sorry. With psalms and
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.740]   spiritual songs. And what it's also produced is thankfulness. And what you'll
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.340]   find is that that concept of thankfulness has been repeated three
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.580]   times. That this should lead to a heart condition of thankfulness in your heart,
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:26.820]   and thankfulness in your heart, and thankfulness in your heart. In thinking
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:33.220]   about all this, we can sit here and dive deep into this stuff. What does it mean
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:38.580]   to have the peace of Christ? Right? And I want you to think about that kind of
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:45.220]   stuff. If, for example, all the various terminologies up here had to do with
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.820]   various hard attitudes and thoughts that you're supposed to have with the other
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.020]   brother and sister in your community, the people around you, all that kind of stuff,
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:59.140]   and it's supposed to be a disposition of who you are, right? How does the peace of
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.300]   Christ affect you in that? How does it really motivate and move you for that?
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.100]   Those are the kind of questions you should be asking. And what in the world
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:13.780]   does it mean to rule? How does peace govern and dictate your heart and the
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:18.380]   decisions that you make? Those are all questions that you can talk about and
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.620]   you can ask. What I'm gonna say is this. Today we were talking about maturity.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.900]   A sense of maturity of your mind, a sense of maturity in your heart where you're
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.020]   humble and willing to break down the things that you think, "Oh no, my
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.500]   intentions are good though," right? Have that introspectiveness, have that
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.660]   conviction to lay it on the table. But also a maturity of love. And my
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:49.780]   challenge is going to be, for all of us, if you saw thanklessness when there was
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:55.300]   privilege, if you saw bitter discontentment when an individual had
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:03.100]   lots, wouldn't you sit there and think, "How immature," right? There is a level to
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:08.460]   which the condition of your heart where it is thankful to God, not because of all
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:14.140]   these things happening, but despite the fact that your circumstances, the outside
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:19.620]   stuff is not going your way. And also, especially despite the fact that inside
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.900]   there might be some turmoil, there might be some conflict, and there might be some
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:31.540]   pain. If you're able to look at the Lord and say, "God, thank you so much," I believe
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:38.320]   the Lord will look at you and say, "I think now you understand," right? Much in
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.440]   the way, much in the way younger children, when they live their lives and they look
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.780]   at their parents and they complain about how controlling their parents were,
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:52.460]   they're complaining about how involved and tigerish their parents were, only to
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.980]   later on realize, "Now that I try to live my own life, I just want to thank
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.020]   you for the hardships and the difficulties that you endured." Now again,
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:05.260]   I know that not all of us have had parents that we're looking up to
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:13.820]   as examples or models for us, but even then, if you can have that kind of source,
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.340]   that kind of power in your heart to look to the Lord and say, "God, thank you so
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:24.580]   much for all that you are, have done, and will do for me," I believe God will look
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:30.340]   at you and say, "Wow, you've matured a lot." Let's take a moment to pray and go
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:43.640]   before the Lord. Our God, we want to thank you so much, again, because Lord, we
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:51.340]   realize, God, that you didn't simply just give us an escape and then leave us to
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:58.460]   be. Your heart of love drew us close. You not only delivered us, but you
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:05.020]   transferred us into your home. And then to think on top of that, God, that you
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:10.700]   would call us your children, and then on top of that, you desire to impart on us
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:16.500]   your knowledge, your heart, and then all the more your character, that you want us
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:22.940]   to reflect who you are. Lord, what a privilege. Lord, what grace, what
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:28.500]   incredible love. Father, I pray that we recognize that your gift of righteousness
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:34.580]   to us, your gift of holiness to us, is something far beyond what we could even
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.580]   imagine or think or even dare ask. So God, we thank you so much that by your
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.780]   love you've initiated and you've granted to us so much according to your grace.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.540]   And I guess simply, Lord, I want to pray that all of us, Lord, would grow in that
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:54.140]   knowledge, and God, there would be thankfulness in our hearts. Lord, that
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:59.500]   there would be a true sense of gratitude in every season of our lives. Father, God,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.980]   we confess the struggle, Lord, oftentimes when we set our minds off of you, Father,
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.700]   Lord, we confess, God, we get distracted, but I do pray that you would draw our
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:14.380]   eyes back to you and cause us to sing with thankfulness. It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.680]   Amen.
