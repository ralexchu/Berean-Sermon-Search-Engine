[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Read your Bibles with me to John chapter 11 and I will be reading from verse 38 to verse
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200]   44.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.800]   John chapter 11 verses 38 to 44.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.480]   We're going to be dealing with the whole chapter but I just want to read this passage before
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.480]   we begin.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.160]   John chapter 11 verse 38 through 44.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.760]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.920]   Then Jesus deeply moved again, came to the tomb.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.960]   It was a cave and a stone lay against it.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.760]   Jesus said, "Take away the stone."
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.840]   Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by this time there will be an
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.760]   order for he has been dead for four days."
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.400]   Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   God?"
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.680]   So they took away the stone and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.240]   that you have heard me.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.320]   I knew that you always hear me but I said this on account of the people standing around,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.760]   that they may believe that you sent me."
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.000]   When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.240]   The man who had died came out.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.040]   His hands and feet were bound with linen strips and his face wrapped with cloth.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.800]   Jesus said to them, "Unbind him and let him go."
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.040]   Let's pray.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.480]   Heavenly Father, help us to know the impact of this resurrection.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.560]   What it means to us, what it means to the world, what it means to mankind.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   Open our eyes, Lord God, as Jesus prayed that they may hear Christ in his prayer and believe.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.880]   Open our eyes, Lord, that we may also hear him and believe.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.960]   We pray, Father God, that this time you would anoint it, you would bless it, that you would
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640]   surround us, Lord God, with your holy presence.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.680]   Help us know that you are here with us, that you hear our prayers, that whatever burdens,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.920]   Lord God, that we have brought before you, may the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Lord
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.880]   God, change that radically.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.560]   May your face shine, may your voice be declared, that your children may hear it and follow
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560]   you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.240]   As I've already mentioned, all over the world, millions and millions of people are gathered
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   together.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.540]   They've already gathered in some place, obviously, because of time zone, and they have celebrated
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.720]   this week.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.520]   Our church, you know, every year it seems like our celebration is getting bigger and
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.920]   bigger, you know.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560]   We did quite a few things this week.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360]   We had, you know, some people came early in the morning and did devotions, but, you know,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.680]   Thursday night we had the Passover meal we did for the first time.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.280]   And so I was very blessed by just the preparation and the time we were able to spend together,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.240]   and it really highlighted the communion table that we had on Friday night.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.640]   And obviously this morning we got together and we had the early rise service, and I know
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.640]   some of you guys are already fatigued and tired, as I am, you know.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.420]   And then we had morning service, this service, and then we're going to have lunch, and maybe
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.720]   play some softball afterwards, all right.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.860]   So it's a long day.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.800]   It's been a long week.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.240]   But I can honestly tell you each year that goes by, the celebration seems to be more
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.720]   meaningful after all these years.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   You know, after more than 35 years of celebrating Lord's resurrection, each year I learn more
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.840]   about the significance and the meaning and the impact of this.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   And every year that we celebrate it, I really, like, the impact of it is striking me more
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   each year.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   You know, I felt like I understood very little when I first became a Christian, but the more
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:52.200]   I dig into it, that everything Christ did, he prepared for this moment, for his resurrection.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.720]   Everything he did, every law that was given, every punishment for sin, every grace that
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.080]   he showed, every disciple that he called to himself, every prophet that he sent to proclaim
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.820]   who he was, everything was to point to this moment for the resurrection.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.200]   Because the resurrection wasn't simply just him coming back to life and saying, "Hey,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.160]   there's hope after death."
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   There's so much power in what he did.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.960]   And the reason why, even after 2,000 years, 2,000 years of human chaos, of wars and famines
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.640]   and even wrong doctrines and heresy, even people of God that was being sent, people
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.840]   who were being burned at the stake for simply wanting to translate the Bible for them to
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.760]   read, in the midst of 2,000 years of chaos, we're still here, all over the world, celebrating
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.720]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   Because God will not allow this to die, because this is the hope of mankind.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.120]   We cannot overstate the significance of this day and why it is appropriate for us to celebrate
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   it as we are doing, and maybe in a greater way.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.920]   I'm not sure what we have in store for next year, but maybe we'll make it even bigger.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.320]   Jesus, you know, obviously everything that he did was preparing for his coming, but we
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.920]   see in this story that takes place in John chapter 11, the resurrection of Lazarus, that
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.800]   as Jesus is going to the cross, he's been telling his disciples that he's going to be
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.960]   crucified, he's going to be raised on the third day.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   But his disciples couldn't understand it.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.600]   And it's made it very clear, over and over again through the Gospels.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.520]   In fact, in the Gospel of Mark, in particular, it says he made this very clear, he made this
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   very clear.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.640]   But every time he said it, their response was, well, who's going to be the greatest
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   in the kingdom of God?
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   They didn't get it.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.000]   It was clear that they didn't understand, because when Jesus was going to the cross,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   they all fell away, because they didn't understand, what is Jesus doing?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.920]   Jesus was preparing for his crucifixion and ultimately for his resurrection.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.720]   And what happens in John chapter 11 sets up for that spectacular event that's going to
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.980]   take place in about a week or two.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.880]   In this story of Lazarus' being raised from the dead, there are four people, three people
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.560]   and one group of people that I want to introduce to you, because every single one of them became
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.640]   spectacular witnesses of his resurrection.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.320]   And the way that Jesus prepared them for that is Lazarus' resurrection.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.200]   So today's outline basically is going to, we're going to be following along in chapter
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.680]   11 and look at the four different people that are introduced to us and their faith and how
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.080]   God impacted them.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.320]   So in order for you to just kind of follow along, so the first person I want to introduce
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.480]   to you is obviously Lazarus.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.040]   Lazarus, it says in John 11, 1, he came from a certain, now a certain man was ill.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.800]   Lazarus was of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.840]   Lazarus was the brother of this prominent family, Mary and Martha.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.340]   Now you know about Mary and Martha because they're introduced to us before this.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.720]   In Luke chapter 10, you don't need to turn your Bible there, but if you remember in Luke
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.080]   chapter 10, Mary and Martha are introduced to us in the context of Jesus sending out
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.980]   his disciples two by two and talking about the kingdom.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.120]   And all of a sudden there's this blip in the middle in Luke chapter 10 about how Martha
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.680]   was angry with Mary.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.120]   You know Martha's personality was the go-getter, she was going out and cooking and cleaning
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.080]   and doing all this stuff and she was angry that Mary was not helping.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.800]   So she incites Jesus to say, "Can you just rebuke her and tell her to come help me?"
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:46.080]   thinking that she was going to get Jesus' ear and get him on her side.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.480]   Instead Jesus rebukes her and turns the table around.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.920]   Well the question is, we study a lot about the meaning behind that and who are Martha's
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.200]   and we are all Martha's and we need to be Mary's and all of these things are significant.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.800]   But before we even study the meaning behind it and why Jesus said it, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   why are they in the Bible in the first place?
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   It sounds like a random thing that happens.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.800]   He's talking about the kingdom, he's talking about sending disciples two by two and all
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.160]   of a sudden he has these two sisters who has a spat and then they show up in the biblical
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.040]   narrative and then they just disappear until this happens.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.320]   Why are they mentioned to begin with?
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.280]   Is it just random?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.920]   And obviously nothing in the scripture is random.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.480]   Most likely the reason why they are mentioned there is because Mary, Martha and Lazarus
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.620]   were very prominent people in the early church.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.600]   Not simply before the resurrection but after the resurrection.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   They were the first and the most prominent witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.680]   And I'm going to be explaining that as we go.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.360]   So Lazarus comes from this family which clearly that Jesus had a special connection with them.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.660]   And as a result of that, they said well Lazarus is ill, Jesus healed so many other people
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.800]   but Lazarus had a special relationship with Jesus.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.080]   So they sent people to go get him and this is the encounter that they have with Jesus,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   John 11 verse 4.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.360]   But when Jesus heard it he said, "This illness does not lead to death.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.620]   It is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.500]   Jesus says that he's ill and obviously his illness wasn't just any illness.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.320]   They were concerned that it may lead to death.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   So we don't know exactly what he had but it was serious enough that they sent somebody
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.880]   way over to where Jesus was to tell him to hurry up and come.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.480]   Assuming that if Jesus is compassionate to complete strangers that he would surely come
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.720]   and save our brother.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.040]   And he promises them, "Don't worry, he's not going to die.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.380]   It is going to be for God's glory."
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.640]   That this was God ordained.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.000]   That Jesus already knew about it even before the people came to get him.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.480]   And then in verse 5 right after he says that it says, "Jesus deliberately stayed two more
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   days."
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.960]   And they said, "Okay, he stays two more days, maybe his illness wasn't that serious."
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.680]   And so think about all the people who are waiting, Lazarus was sick, anxious that Jesus
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720]   is not quickly responding.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.660]   And when Jesus finally responds in verse 17, it says, "By the time he comes he is four
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.600]   days dead."
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.720]   He waited until he was dead and he was buried in the tomb already for four days.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.500]   You have to remember in the Bible, number three is the number of confirmation.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.480]   So you need three witnesses to confirm something.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.400]   That the Trinity, they have a, they confess or complete one another in the Trinity.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.520]   So the number three is the number of completion.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.680]   Jesus dies and on the third day he is raised to confirm that he was actually dead.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   He didn't just swoon, he didn't just faint, he actually died and came back to life.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.800]   The fact that Lazarus was dead for four days is to confirm not only was he dead, but there
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.440]   is absolutely no hope for him.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.640]   And that's exactly what Jesus was waiting for.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:25.400]   Jesus deliberately waits until he is dead, until he is in the tomb, and they have completely
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.800]   lost hope.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   And we know exactly what happens.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.080]   Jesus shows up, people are concerned, "Why didn't you show up in time?"
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.680]   Jesus gets to the tomb in chapter 11, verse 43.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.560]   He says, "He cried out with a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come out!'
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.360]   The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips and his face
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.640]   wrapped with a cloth.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.080]   Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him and let him go.'"
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.280]   Lazarus, it is the darkest thing that ever happened to him.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.880]   I mean, you can't get worse than that.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.920]   The worst thing that can happen as a human being is obviously get ill and then die.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.680]   And that happened, and he was in the grave for four days.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.720]   But his most darkest, excruciating experience as a human being turns into his greatest testimony.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:22.560]   You can imagine that Lazarus was a fantastic witness about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   If there was anybody that had any credibility about what he saw, it probably would have
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   been Lazarus.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.800]   Because Lazarus himself experienced death, and then he came back to life.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   And again, the reason why this family was so prominent was because they actually experienced
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.000]   what they were going to see in Jesus in a few days.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.360]   You can imagine Lazarus, maybe Apostle Peter, and some of the other people who experienced
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.000]   the miracles of God sitting around talking, maybe at a campfire, sharing their testimonies
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and stories.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.920]   And Peter talking about how he walked on water, and Bartimaeus talking about how he was blind
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   and now he sees.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:07.000]   And the lame man who was risen, and he was lame all his life, and then all of a sudden
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.280]   he rises and they share all of this and comparing their notes.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:18.120]   And Lazarus just steps in and says, "I died, and I came back to life."
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.600]   Nobody can trump his testimony.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.640]   Anywhere he went, he has the most interesting story.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.400]   And I would imagine everywhere he went, people would sit around him, and say, "Lazarus, what
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.840]   was it like?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   When you died, where did you go?"
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.320]   That's a question we ask all the time.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   Where did Jesus go?
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.320]   "Lazarus died.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.600]   Where did you go?"
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.240]   I could imagine, you know, we talk about like, "Where is paradise?"
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.360]   Jesus told the robbers, "Today you shall be with me in paradise."
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.400]   And so there's a lot of different opinions about paradise.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.480]   They probably ask Lazarus, "Lazarus, what is that?
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   Where did you go?
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   What did paradise look like?
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   Were you sleeping?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.640]   Were you actually with the Lord?
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.240]   Where did you go?"
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.620]   So I could imagine that Lazarus was probably the center of attention wherever he went.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.680]   That even his death turned into a preparation for the greatest testimony to prepare for
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.280]   his resurrection.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.160]   We don't know what God is doing in our lives.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.720]   But when you encounter the resurrected Christ, whatever hardship, whatever bitterness, whatever
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.100]   hatred, whatever you've experienced in the past, the resurrection changes everything.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.160]   Because we are so afraid that if we make the wrong decisions, that we're not going to live
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   well here.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.680]   And if we make the worst decisions, that we might possibly die.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:44.200]   But when Lazarus came to the greatest fear of mankind, he met Christ.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.640]   He met Christ like he never met before.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.320]   And so he became the greatest witness for the resurrection of Jesus Christ because he
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.920]   personally experienced that himself.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.880]   The second group of people that I want to mention to you are mentioned in verse 31 and 33.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.720]   Verse 31, he says, "When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.080]   Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.680]   to weep there."
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.120]   And then verse 33, "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping,
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.840]   he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled."
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.000]   The people who came that are talking about this group of people, these were probably
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.600]   people who were friends of this family.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   This is a prominent family.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.760]   There's possibly a large number, considering that it's near the Passover and the Feast
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.400]   of Unleavened Bread, that they needed to come to Jerusalem anyway.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   And we know that later on, that as a result of this resurrection of Lazarus, that the
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.600]   word began to spread.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.360]   So these people probably either they went home and stayed in Jerusalem.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.000]   They were the first ones who were to testify, "He has to be the Messiah."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.200]   We were there.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   Lazarus wasn't just ill.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.240]   He was in the grave for four days.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.640]   But if you see what they say when it says in verse 34, "Where have you laid him?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.320]   They said to him, 'Lord, come and see.'
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.480]   Jesus wept."
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.040]   So the Jews said, "See how he loved him?"
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.320]   But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.720]   man from dying?"
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.940]   So some of these Jews were looking at Jesus weeping, and instead of having compassion,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.720]   they started getting bitter.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.680]   Why are you weeping?
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.200]   We asked you to come when he was alive, when there was hope.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.400]   That's why we sent our friends.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.880]   Why did you wait two days?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.720]   Why did you arrive four days later when we made it clear to you that he was about to
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.100]   die?
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.360]   So instead of having compassion, it's that clearly he loved them.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.040]   But if you loved him, why did you not do anything?
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.200]   They heard about Jesus' miracles.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.880]   They heard that he had the power to open eyes of the people who are blind, walking on water.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.760]   He had power over nature.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.680]   The Pharisees, the powerful leaders of Israel, he would just walk right among them and they
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.020]   couldn't do anything.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:18.600]   And yet, when their close companion that he loved, when he was ill, he seemed to just
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.580]   nonchalantly stroll into town after he dies four days.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:29.500]   And so they're asking, probably with some bitterness and anger, "Could not he who opened
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:35.140]   the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?"
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.380]   They asked this question because they did not know what Jesus was about to do.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:47.520]   Their understanding of Jesus was limited to what they saw and what they heard.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:56.460]   They didn't understand that Jesus came to save those who are sick and under bondage.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:02.900]   They were Jesus who knew Jesus with his miracles, but they did not really know who he was.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.260]   Small Phillips writes a book entitled "Your God is Too Small" and he says this in his
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:17.040]   book, "The inadequate conceptions of God would still linger unconsciously in many minds and
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.500]   which prevent our catching a glimpse of the true God."
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.740]   In other words, he's saying, it's because our God in our mind is too small, unconsciously,
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.180]   and that's the reason that we never really truly see God.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.680]   Oftentimes our prayers are limited by our faith.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.900]   We only pray for things that we think are possible because we don't want to be disappointed.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.200]   We don't want to come before God and pray for things that are too big in our mind.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.920]   These are people who believe Jesus to a certain extent, but once he was dead, that's where
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.200]   his power ends because they did not understand who he was.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.960]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.680]   Jesus does this purposefully.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.160]   He does this right before he goes to the cross because these people were going to be the
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.240]   first groups of people who were going to be the witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.640]   Basically the mourning of a lost one would take at least seven days, maybe longer than
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   that.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   And considering that they're near the Passover and they're considering that they're near
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.840]   the festival of the unleavened bread, they might have just come in to Bethany and maybe
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.160]   just stuck around.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.440]   Most likely, these were among the first 500 people that are mentioned in 1 Corinthians
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   15.6 that saw, was the eyewitness of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.680]   They were probably the first groups of people who saw the resurrection and they probably
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.280]   understood Jesus' resurrection better than anybody else because they saw Lazarus come
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.160]   back from the dead.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.400]   So if anybody would have been easy to convince, if Jesus can raise Lazarus, surely he can
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.180]   also come back from the dead.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:01.400]   And they were probably the first witnesses, the first evangelists that 1 Corinthians 15.6
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.160]   talks about.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:11.400]   And though they may have had defective faith, though their faith was weak and did not understand
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:18.680]   the bigger picture, that at the resurrection they are changed, completely changed.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.640]   And my guess is that many of them were also crucified, just like the disciples.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.280]   Many of them were also fed to the lions, many of them were also burned at the stake, along
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.880]   with many of the other disciples.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.840]   They were the first witnesses.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.040]   But they were utterly changed.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.480]   You see, you can come to church all your life and participate in worship, participate in
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.680]   communion, to teach, maybe even go to missions at times, become a great Bible teacher, but
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   until you encounter the resurrected Christ, you can talk about God, you can talk about
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:03.120]   how he helps us in our weakness and how he binds the brokenhearted, but until you encounter
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.520]   the resurrected Christ, you do not know him.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.880]   Because the Christ that they knew before his resurrection, the Christ that they knew after
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.160]   the resurrection, was the same Christ, but their faith was completely changed.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.560]   They were completely changed.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.000]   And this is why this day is so important to every single one of us.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.040]   Until you come face to face with this resurrected Christ, our testimony is nothing more than
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.120]   regurgitation of things that you have heard before.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.380]   Bible teaching is nothing more than studying materials in a book and then sharing it with
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.380]   somebody else.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.380]   That's all it is.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.680]   So if you happen to be a good teacher, you become a good pastor.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.080]   But that is not what Jesus calls us for.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.680]   He calls us to be a witness.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.800]   Until we encounter the resurrected Christ, our testimony is just information.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:59.640]   These people encountered Christ and they were the first groups of people who probably risked
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.440]   their lives and many of them gave their lives to share about Jesus' resurrection.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.760]   The third person I want to introduce to you is Mary.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:15.900]   Mary is the one that was commended over Martha in Luke chapter 10.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.360]   In John 11, 32, it says, "Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.240]   his feet, saying to him, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.'"
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.640]   We know that Mary loved Jesus.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.920]   In Luke chapter 10, when Martha comes running and asks the Lord, "Tell Mary to help me,"
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.080]   and remember what Jesus said?
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.280]   "Martha, you are worried about so many things, but Mary has chosen," what?
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   "The best."
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.080]   And what was she doing?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.400]   She was just there soaking up everything that Jesus had to say.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.960]   Martha was so busy serving the Lord, but she wasn't paying attention.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.480]   And that's sometimes when people talk about being getting burnt out at church, it's because
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.040]   we're so busy when we come to church, like, "What does God want?
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   What do I do?
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   What do I have to do?"
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.520]   And then when we live our lives like that, after a while, we get bitter just like Martha,
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.880]   "How come nobody else is helping me?"
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.280]   Not realizing that we come to him because we are in need.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.840]   We don't come to church because he needs us.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.440]   And the moment we put on that hat of, "Somehow, I'm going to help the kingdom of God," eventually
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.000]   we get burnt out.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.400]   See, Mary knew early on the commandment that Jesus said.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.000]   The greatest commandment is, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   and strength."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.400]   And so she was sitting there in love with Christ, just soaking up his word.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.500]   And Jesus said, "That's what I'm looking for, worshippers who will worship me in spirit
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.400]   and in truth."
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:54.280]   And when her brother dies, just like any other human being, "Lord, if you had been here,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.000]   my brother would not have died in her grief."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.880]   She's complaining to Jesus, "Where were you?
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.180]   I loved you.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.960]   And I know you love me.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.480]   Why did you not come?"
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.320]   It's because she didn't understand.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.040]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't love Lazarus that he allowed this to happen.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.680]   It was exactly the opposite.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.600]   It was because Jesus did love her.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.800]   It was because Jesus did love Lazarus and Martha, why Lazarus died.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   In fact, in John 11, verse 5, it says, "Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus."
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:35.080]   And it was clearly declared that he loved her, he loved them.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.780]   But they were chosen for this because he loved them.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.800]   They were chosen for this because they were going to be the first witnesses outside of
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.280]   the disciples to go proclaim what was going to happen.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.500]   We know that she loved Jesus.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.700]   But she's introduced to us in John 11, 2-3 this way, "It was Mary who anointed the Lord
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:02.360]   with the ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill."
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:08.600]   Now this encounter where Mary wipes the feet of Jesus with her hair, this anointing of
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:14.760]   Jesus happens another time in Luke chapter 7 of a sinful woman.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.080]   And when she does that, the Pharisees look at that and say, "Man, if Jesus really was
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.200]   a prophet, they should know she was a sinner and wouldn't have allowed her to touch his
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   feet."
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.960]   But this is not that encounter.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.720]   Mary was different than that.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.320]   In fact, she doesn't anoint him until after the resurrection of Lazarus.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.440]   And it's recorded for us in John chapter 12, 1-3.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.920]   It says, "Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was,"
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.440]   and this is after the resurrection, "whom Jesus," resurrection of Lazarus, "whom Jesus
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.160]   had raised from the dead.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.680]   So they gave a dinner for him there.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.520]   Martha served," obviously.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.520]   That's who she is.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.040]   So she was out there serving.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.320]   And Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at the table.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.840]   I think he was a younger brother, so he's not serving.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.360]   So he's just hanging out.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.320]   And then, "Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard and
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.800]   anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her."
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.400]   I mean, it is such a touching scene.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.800]   They're all grieving.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.200]   Just a week ago, they were just grieving and weeping.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   Where were you?
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.320]   Why come you didn't come?
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.560]   And all of a sudden, they're having a banquet.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.880]   And Martha, this time, is serving.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.600]   And my bet is she was serving with joy, not like the other one.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   Not like Luke chapter 10.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.640]   This time, she was like, "Oh my gosh, thank you."
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   And she's serving.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.680]   That's her way of expressing her love to Jesus.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.560]   She's not serving and they say, "Look at Mary.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   She's sitting down again."
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.520]   Because that's her way of serving.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.440]   That's her way of worshiping.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.620]   You could imagine Lazarus is sitting there reclining and I'll bet he was not alone.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.960]   My guess is everybody that came to this party was sitting around Lazarus asking, "So what
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.680]   was it like?
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   Did you see the light?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.120]   Did you hear his voice when the linens came off?
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   Did it just come right off?
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.600]   What did you do with that stink?
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   You must have stunk.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   What did you do?
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   Where did you go?
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   Did you go to paradise?
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   Were there other people?
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.200]   Did you see Moses and Elijah?"
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.800]   I'm sure they had tons of questions.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.600]   They're sitting there in this party and it is at that scene, Mary therefore took a pound
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   of expensive ointment made from pure nard, which would have been the cost of a whole
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   year's salary.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.920]   And again, this was a very prominent family.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.280]   It's unlike what we saw with the sinful woman.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.600]   They probably had the money.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   But it was still a lot of money.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.920]   But again, this is not a sinner.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:44.040]   This is a prominent woman who probably had a great reputation.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.200]   Prestigious maybe.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.280]   And she humbles herself and she says she wiped Jesus' feet with her hair.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.480]   Now you have to understand the culture that they're in, that the feet was considered the
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.440]   dirtiest part of the human body.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.320]   Now you and I live in a culture where that is not the case.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.240]   We have all kinds of things to clean our feet.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   Get manicured, pedicure.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   You take your shoes off.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.040]   Oh, your feet looks nice.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   That's not this culture.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.840]   So if you've ever been to India, you know that in that culture, that's the way they
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   view feet.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.500]   In fact, those of you who've been to India with us or you've been there by yourself,
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.840]   you know that part of the things that is a no-no in India is when you sit, you never
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.860]   do this, which I just did.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:31.920]   You never do this because to show the bottom of your feet to somebody in India is basically
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.840]   disrespecting them completely, right?
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.720]   Because they consider that the dirtiest part of the body.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.800]   And then those of you who've been with us there to the villages, you know what their
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.060]   feet look like because they don't normally wear shoes, a lot of them.
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.680]   And so when wintertime comes around and it gets really dry, their feet crack.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.840]   And when we say crack, we're not talking about a slight little line and just kind of put
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   a bandaid on.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.680]   We're talking about like cracked in half, you know?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   And it's pretty gnarly.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.040]   And so the feet is considered the dirtiest part of the body.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:05.400]   So the culture that Jesus was living in is very similar because they either wore sandals
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.560]   or they didn't have good shoes, so their feet were pretty gnarly.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   And so remember when Jesus is teaching his disciples to get on his feet, to show them,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.720]   to humble themselves, he washes the dirtiest part, right?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.040]   That a master would never touch.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.280]   Even the lowliest of the slave in the house would only touch, and Jesus does that.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:31.640]   And so she is getting on her knees, and not only is she touching his feet, it's with her
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   own hair.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.180]   And again, this is not a sinner who's already humbled.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.080]   This is a woman of prestige.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.240]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 11, 15, Paul says the glory of a woman is what?
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.800]   Her hair.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.320]   So even in our culture, you know, people don't like it when people touch their hair because
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.600]   you consider that disrespectful.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.480]   In this particular time for a woman to humble herself and let her hair down and to use that
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:03.640]   hair which was considered her glory and to wipe Jesus' dirty feet, and that was her expression
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.320]   of love for Jesus.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:14.120]   If she loved Jesus before Lazarus died, can you imagine the depth of affection she must
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.200]   have had for Jesus?
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.720]   That's the intimate scene that we see here in chapter 12.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.400]   But the real significance of this is not simply that she loved Jesus.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.500]   It says that she anointed him.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.260]   She anointed him.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.400]   It wasn't just a wiping.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.900]   It wasn't just to make it clean.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.600]   It wasn't just a pedicure.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.520]   What did she anoint him for?
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.880]   It seems like she knew what was coming.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.800]   The disciples heard and all they were talking about who's the greatest, you know, and Pastor
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   James gave the great sermon on Friday talking about how Jesus going to crawl to the cross
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.480]   and Peter is saying, you know, they may all fall down but not me, and he didn't understand.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.680]   Mary was soaking up what Jesus was saying.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.440]   How much she understood, we do not know, but she must have clearly understood.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.000]   She was anointing him for his death, for his burial, and his resurrection.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.120]   What an intimate scene.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:24.800]   This encounter of this woman who loved Jesus, but she had no idea to what depth Jesus loved
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.480]   her.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.960]   Martha, the last person I want to introduce you to.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.200]   Martha, again, was a sister in the story in Luke chapter 10.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.480]   If you study Martha carefully in the few passages that she comes out, Martha is the female version
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.840]   of Apostle Peter.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.360]   She gets rebuked by Jesus for rebuking him about not rebuking Mary.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:56.040]   Doesn't that sound very similar to Peter?
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.360]   Peter gets rebuked for rebuking Jesus.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.160]   Them two are the only two that actually, like, you're the son of God, but let me tell you
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.400]   what's up, right?
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.120]   That's Martha.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:16.160]   In Luke chapter 10, 41 to 42, Jesus says, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.440]   about many things."
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.600]   Again, whenever you see somebody's name being mentioned twice, watch out.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.080]   Jesus doesn't waste words.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.000]   When he says, "Martha, Martha," something's coming.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.120]   Usually something is coming.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:35.920]   "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.720]   Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her."
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.200]   She gets rebuked before rebuking Jesus.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.080]   But looking at the response that she gives to Jesus when Jesus shows up, you can see
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.720]   that there was a change in Martha.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.480]   There was something about her faith that stood out among others.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.120]   In John 11, 20 to 27, it says, "So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   met him.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.800]   But many remained seated in the house.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.560]   Martha said to Jesus, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.'"
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.080]   So her response was just like anybody else.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.440]   She was grieving over her dead brother.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.080]   "Lord, how come you didn't come?"
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.120]   But here's a distinction between her faith and the others in verse 22.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:30.920]   "But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:36.960]   When everybody else lost hope, Martha did not.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:42.360]   Martha was grieving, was hurt, was saddened, just like everybody else.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.120]   But she understood something about Jesus that the other people did not.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.920]   Even now, even in his death, if you will, you can raise him.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.480]   Jesus said to her, again, Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   on the third day."
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.520]   She didn't know exactly what he was going to do, but she still had hope.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.000]   Jesus says in verse 25 to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.280]   Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.040]   And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.200]   Do you believe this?"
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:24.560]   And that's the question that he proposes to her, to every Christian, and even now, all
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.320]   over the world.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.760]   As we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we're not just celebrating something
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.800]   that happened 2,000 years ago and saying, "Do you think he came back from the dead?"
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:40.640]   He said, "Do you believe that because he rose from the dead, that even if you die, you shall
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   not die?
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.040]   Do you believe this?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.320]   That our life is not here?
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.280]   That even if you are in sickness, even if the worst possible thing that you can possibly
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.040]   imagine happened to you, that even if you die, you shall surely live?
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.840]   Do you believe this?"
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.080]   Because based upon whether you believe this or not, it changes your life.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.200]   You can come to church all your life and superficially confess you believe without really believing
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.560]   and never have anything be changed in your life.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.360]   Just take advantage of the benefits of being around other Christians, because who wouldn't?
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.040]   Typically Christians are more gracious.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.240]   Typically Christians are more generous, more supportive.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.560]   Who wouldn't want to be part of this community?
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.840]   Even if you weren't a believer, I would.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   But that's not what the church is about.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.480]   And that's the greatest tragedy sometimes of being raised in a church, where you love
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:42.840]   the benefits of Christianity without knowing Jesus.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:49.800]   That question that he proposes, "Do you believe this?" is the question that everybody needs
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.280]   to be asking themselves this morning.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.680]   Not do you confess this, not do you sign on the doctrinal statement, but do you believe
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.640]   this that even if you die, you shall live?
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.520]   Martha answers the question.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.800]   She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.120]   coming into the world."
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.880]   That sounded a lot like Peter's confession in Matthew 16, 16.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   Who do men say I am?
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.040]   Well, who do you say I am?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.000]   Jesus, Peter says, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.600]   And this is why I said, Martha is the female version of Apostle Peter.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.480]   She says all the wrong things, but she says the right thing.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.340]   They both come out of the same person's mouth.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.480]   And that's Martha.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.320]   Martha seems to have paid attention when she was rebuked in Luke chapter 10.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.640]   "You're so busy, but you're missing the point."
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.800]   Martha seems to have paid attention to him.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.200]   And eventually, as a result, she encounters him.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.080]   What Jesus means when he says, "I am the resurrection," isn't that Jesus is going
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.240]   to give you life.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.840]   He says, "I am the life."
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.680]   He didn't say, "If you come to me, I will show you the truth."
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.280]   He says, "I am the truth."
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.840]   He didn't say, "If you hunger and thirst, come to me and I will give you bread."
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.560]   He says, "I am the bread.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.920]   I am, I am, I am, I am."
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.000]   The whole point of Christianity is to come to Christ.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Coming to church doesn't mean you're coming to Christ.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.400]   Reading the Bible doesn't make your relationship with Christ intimate.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.340]   You can know all your theology, you can do all the right things and completely miss if
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.280]   you do not encounter the resurrected Christ.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:41.100]   If you do not believe that what Christ has done was not necessary for this life.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.420]   Does our faith go up and down based upon our personal circumstances?
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.100]   When things we want doesn't happen the way we want?
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:53.860]   Or people in church or our families disappoint us and all of a sudden our faith tanks as
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.360]   a result of our circumstance?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:01.260]   Because God didn't provide or give what we wanted?
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:08.700]   Does our faith go up and down based upon how good or bad we think God is to us?
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:14.100]   He says even if you die, even the worst possible scenario you can imagine, even in death there's
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.620]   hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.400]   Do you believe this?
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.860]   And if you believe this, it changes your life.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.020]   I don't have to tell you, change your life.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.980]   I don't have to tell you to be disciplined.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.460]   I don't have to tell you to read the Word of God.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.980]   Because in it is life.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.080]   If you want to live, you don't travel, you don't watch movies, you don't eat good things.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.100]   If you believe life is in this book, you will come to this book.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.180]   If you believe that Jesus Christ is a resurrected life, why would you not go to Him?
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.300]   Why would you not want to talk to Him?
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.740]   Why would you not want to have fellowship with Him?
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:59.380]   Why wouldn't be the greatest desire of our heart, soul, mind, and strength be Jesus,
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.020]   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus?
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.300]   That's what Jesus is saying.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.100]   Do you believe this?
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.640]   Do you believe this?
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.840]   Jesus' resurrection was unlike Lazarus.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.380]   There's been many resurrections before Lazarus.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.500]   The widow of Nain's son in Luke chapter 7, Jairus' daughter, Luke 8.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.520]   Many who died when Jesus was resurrected, they said the saints also raised from the
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   dead.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:33.040]   Old Testament prophets, widow of Zarephath's son, Shunai woman's son, the man raised in
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.920]   Elisha's grave.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.800]   Even after Jesus' resurrection in Acts chapter 9, Tabitha is raised.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.000]   Eutychus in chapter 20 of the book of Acts.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.520]   Jesus was not the only one raised from the dead.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.360]   It wasn't just Lazarus.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:56.040]   But the difference between all of that was Jesus was raised for our sins.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.720]   He didn't just come to prolong Lazarus' life.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.520]   Even if he was raised from the dead and they celebrated for a while, eventually Lazarus
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.640]   died.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.440]   The lepers were suffering in their disease.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.640]   Jesus cleanses them.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.140]   Eventually they also died.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.040]   The blind man who saw for the first time was celebrating.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.800]   Eventually he died.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   All these people who were brought back to death, they were prolonged.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.760]   Maybe their life was a little bit more comfortable.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.880]   But eventually they all died.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:37.360]   Jesus did not come to bring a band-aid for cancer.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.880]   So many people around the world are flocking to Jesus because they want a band-aid.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   They want something to eat.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   They want better relationships.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.240]   They want better marriage.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   They want a better future.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.360]   They want better health.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.400]   But the problem of mankind is not a cut.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.280]   It's that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.840]   And the sin that brings death reigns.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.240]   It's not just living among us.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.360]   It's not outside of us.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   It reigns.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.720]   And that's why Jesus says, "It's not what you put into a man that defiles him.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.160]   It's what comes out."
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.920]   We are sick from the inside.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:20.800]   Every single one of you have lived long enough to know the damage that sin does in our lives.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Damage of pride, damage of coveting, of lying, of adultery, of pornography.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   You know what that damage is.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.840]   You've had first-hand look in yourselves, in your family, in your friends, your coworkers,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.560]   and in the world.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.860]   There is no remedy for that outside of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.560]   No politician is going to fix that.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.300]   No economic upturn is going to fix that.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.280]   No investment is going to fix that.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.000]   Aligning yourself with the right people isn't going to fix that.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.920]   It is only when we encounter the resurrected Jesus Christ.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.760]   That's what this day represents.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.120]   It's not just a man died and then he came back to life.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.920]   That's great.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:13.740]   The answer for me, you, mankind, past, present, and future is represented in the resurrection
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.480]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:24.400]   And until we believe that with all our heart, nothing changes.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:31.440]   First Corinthians 15, 53-57, "For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.680]   mortal body must put on immortality.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.800]   When the perishable puts on the imperishable and the mortal puts on the immortality, then
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.000]   shall come to pass the saying that is written, 'Death is followed up in victory.'
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.720]   O death, where is your victory?
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.160]   O death, where is your sting?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.680]   The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:01.760]   When he says here, the perishable will be raised imperishable, the perishable is not
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.200]   simply talking about your physical body.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   It's physical body definitely is something to look forward to.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.280]   The older we get, especially those of you who are athletic at one point in your life.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:20.440]   It's a fond memory you had, but it's no longer.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.680]   Let's be honest.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   We look at some of you guys in your 20s with envy.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   I used to do that.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.880]   In my mind, I was thinking, "Can I take this guy?
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.960]   Could I have taken this guy when I was 20?"
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.880]   I never say it, but I think it all the time.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.200]   So something to look forward to, that the perishable will be put away, the imperishable.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:48.000]   So we're going to have even playing ground when we get to heaven.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.120]   But what we really long for is not the physical.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   It's a damage that you've experienced because of sin.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   Sins that you've committed, and sins that was committed against you.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.920]   There's a lot of you in this room, staggering from relation to relationship, looking for
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.280]   a fix.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.420]   For a counselor to answer your questions.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:19.520]   To find a church, or a group of people, or a mentor, or something, because of the damage
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.760]   of sin.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:29.120]   The only answer to that isn't the resurrected Jesus Christ.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:35.240]   That's why Jesus says, "All who are weary and heavy laden, come to me."
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   He didn't say, "Go to church."
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.640]   He didn't say, "See my disciples."
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.740]   He said, "Come to me, and I will give you rest.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.660]   Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.500]   shall find rest for your soul."
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.100]   The only rest for the damage that sin has done in our lives is Jesus.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.100]   That's what this day represents.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:04.420]   I want to encourage you in Romans 10, 9 through 12, as we wrap up.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.580]   It says, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.020]   God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.540]   For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:23.820]   For the scripture says, 'Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.'"
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:28.260]   I pray with all my heart that you will believe this with all your heart.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.220]   Meet the resurrected Christ.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.460]   There is nothing like him.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.140]   There is nothing like him.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.940]   Sometimes life gets hard.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.060]   You live in this earth, and you'll experience pain.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.140]   You'll experience pain in relationships.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.060]   The heaviness of paying your bills, raising your children.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.500]   Just like everybody else, you're going to experience the suffering of living in a fallen
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   world.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:00.100]   But the darker that the world becomes, the more precious the light of Jesus Christ becomes.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.500]   So I want to invite you, come to the Lord.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.260]   Hear his voice.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.260]   It's not this church.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.260]   It's not me.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.260]   It's not some Bible study.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   It's not some person.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   Jesus.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.140]   It's my sheep, they will hear my voice.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.620]   They will follow me.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.940]   So I invite you this morning, if you heard the word of Christ, and the question that
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.500]   Jesus asked, "Do you believe?"
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.060]   That's the question I want to ask you this morning.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.300]   Do you believe?
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.860]   So as our worship team comes up, I'm going to invite you to take some time to pray.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:38.740]   If you're here, and you've never confessed your sins to Christ, and you feel like you've
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:46.740]   never met him in that way, again, we ask you to come before the Lord in honest prayer.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.740]   Because Christ is our mediator, we don't need another mediator to come to Christ.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:55.220]   You can go directly to him and ask for forgiveness.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.940]   Ask the Lord to open your eyes, to help me.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.660]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.980]   And afterwards, if you need further guidance, and you have some questions, and you just
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.720]   want to sit and ask, or you want somebody to pray for you, just come to the table outside,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.780]   and we'll be able to help you with that.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.860]   Or just come up to the front afterwards, and we'll sit down and try to pray with you.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.820]   But we want to invite you to take advantage of that today.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.420]   So as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
