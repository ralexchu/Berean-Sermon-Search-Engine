[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.220]   Good morning, church family.
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.220]   My name is Sam.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.060]   I'm part of the family ministry.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.220]   This is my wife, Ohi.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.480]   You can commonly see her rocking out on the keyboard.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.380]   And I have two daughters, Carol and Cadence, who are four, and Cadence just turned two.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.380]   So I'm here.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.680]   I'm going to share my brief testimony about how I'm being here baptized today.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.080]   I was born into a loving Christian home and just simply thought being a good kid was enough.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.120]   Everything was good until my junior year of high school when my sister, Diane, went off
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   to college.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.720]   And life became a bit more lonely and a bit more depressing.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.360]   One weekend, Diane came home to visit and she simply asked me, "Do you think you know
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   Christ?"
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.400]   If you look at Diane, she's crying already.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.360]   I answered with a "no," and she proceeded to share the gospel with me.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.760]   This is the moment where I can truly say to myself that I started seeking after the Lord.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:21.200]   During this time, the Lord continually revealed my sins, such as selfishness, lust, and pride,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.160]   and that my circumstances was caused because of my total depravity.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720]   I recognized that my wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.280]   Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.320]   I also realized that I needed to make Christ my Lord and I wanted to pursue to be obedient
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   to him.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.360]   So, from then on, late at high school, I accepted Christ as the Lord over my life.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.160]   Life as a believer has been different with each life stage.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.320]   In my early college years, my sins were very clear.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.280]   It was constant struggles with lust and girls.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   Post-college, it was career and money.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.280]   But now in my early 30s, my sins have become a little bit more subtle and harder to pinpoint.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.600]   A recent sin that I've been wrestling with is just making my kids a top priority.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   It's been a huge struggle as a father to give what I think is best for my kids, as opposed
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.600]   to discovering God's will and prayerfully deciding.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.640]   Every waking moment, I am fighting to choose Christ as my Lord and that life is not about
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.600]   me or my kids, but more so about how can I die to myself each and every day.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.960]   God's word in Galatians 2.20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.200]   I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.920]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.960]   me and gave himself up for me."
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.480]   So after years of being a believer, why get baptized now?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.800]   I was infant baptized and confirmed in college through the Presbyterian Church.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.400]   And you know, even after my own personal studies on baptism and rejecting the idea of infant
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.840]   baptism, I just thought to myself, "What's the point of getting baptized now?"
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.560]   After just navigating through my own heart, the answer to that is very simple.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.240]   It's because Christ is my Lord and I want to be obedient to him.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   I want to uphold God as high as I possibly can.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400]   I want to be obedient in every possible way that I can.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.240]   And this means getting baptized, not confirmed.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.200]   So I'm here with my shortcomings as a sinner, understanding that through this baptism I'll
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.720]   be uniting with Christ in his death and uniting with Christ in his resurrection, which my
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.840]   confirmation was not able to do.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   For that, I am excited for this moment.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   I'm excited to be obedient to his call and to continue to navigate through life, being
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.000]   sanctified and surrendering all to him.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.560]   Today not only marks my baptism, but also marks my daughter's second birthday.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.840]   So I'm excited to be baptized by Pastor Peter, who has shepherded me.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.360]   And yesterday I just found out that James is also going to be a part of it as well.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I joke about letting James marry my sister, but in all seriousness, James has been a huge
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.620]   mentor, a brother that helped me grow in so many ways.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.760]   Not just me, but I know so many other brothers feel the same way.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.120]   So for that, I'm very excited.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   And I thank everyone for this time.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.120]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120]   Is it on?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   No, you can go all the way down.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   Okay.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:50.140]   I'm going to dunk you.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.140]   You've got to go all the way in.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.500]   Do you understand, Sam, when you're going into the water, you're uniting with Christ
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.180]   in his death, and when you come out, you're uniting with his resurrected life?
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.340]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.340]   All the way down.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.340]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.660]   [APPLAUSE]
