[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.680]   that we have in our Savior.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.480]   And so I wanna highlight that on Saturday,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.680]   before that Christmas service time,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.360]   from 1230 to 2300, there's gonna be an opportunity
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.520]   to go outreach and to just greet people
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.820]   and to pass out these flowers,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.620]   but also just to share the gospel
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.000]   with the opportunities that we have.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.300]   So if you'd like to sign up for that
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.680]   or you have questions, please, the link is there.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840]   Make sure you sign up through that.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   As the end of the year approaches,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.200]   we do have some fellowship opportunities
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   to spend time together as a church family.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.160]   One, there's a ping pong tournament on Sunday,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.600]   and you can sign up for that.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.840]   All levels of skill are welcome.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.680]   We also have New Year's games at 8 p.m.,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.300]   and that's just actually free time
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.840]   for people to come together.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   If you're newer to the church,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.720]   that's a good time just to jump on in.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.560]   We're gonna have some greeters at the door,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.000]   help you get placed into board games
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.720]   or different activities as well.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   And then we have our New Year service
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.120]   to really give that time to the Lord
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.640]   as we usher in the new year.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.400]   So if you wanna mark your calendars for that,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.340]   11 p.m. is the New Year service.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.640]   The other thing I wanna highlight
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.280]   is that we announced last week
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   that we're going to be taking
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.840]   what is called a Lottie Moon Missions Offering
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.860]   on Sunday the 29th.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.040]   And some of you may not know exactly what that is,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.800]   but that is fundraising specifically for missions
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.080]   hosted by the International Mission Board.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.440]   So the funds will go to that organization
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.280]   and that is the organization that our friends,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120]   the Han family and Tong family are involved with.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.660]   And we are able to earmark our offering towards them.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.840]   So just to let you guys know,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.960]   Lottie Moon, the name comes from a famous individual
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   who went to China to do missions
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.480]   and invested years and years and faithfully tried to teach,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.400]   tried to minister to the people there.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.000]   And for her namesake,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.900]   they made this into an annual offering time for us.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.200]   We're gonna be participating in this year.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.720]   And so again, it's gonna be Sunday the 29th,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.560]   not next week, but the following week after.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.600]   There's also just a highlight for you,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.440]   still time if you'd like to contribute
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.080]   to offerings for the India pastors,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.000]   there is a link there that you can participate that way
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600]   or reach out to Sarah Kim if you have any questions.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.280]   At this time, Pastor Nathan will come
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.640]   to deliver us the message.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.640]   - Thank you.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.460]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.700]   If you could turn with me to 1 Peter chapter five,
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.860]   we're gonna read just two verses, verses eight and nine.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.620]   And it says in his word,
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.980]   "Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.220]   "Your adversary, the devil,
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.820]   "howls around like a roaring lion,
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.740]   "seeking someone to devour.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.340]   "But resist him firm in your faith,
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.840]   "knowing that the same experiences of suffering
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.500]   "are being accomplished by your brethren
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.180]   "who are in the world."
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.220]   Would you pray with me?
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.720]   Heavenly Father, thank you so much.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.560]   Thank you that we can, week after week,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.400]   come back together and we are filled with joy
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.840]   as we can sing songs together,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.380]   listen to your word together,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.280]   to commune, to fellowship,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.260]   all in all, Father, to marvel and wonder
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.720]   at the wonderful God that you are.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.660]   You are the God that we serve.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.000]   Your kingdom is the one we live for.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.260]   Father, you are our God.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.600]   And Lord, when we hear your word, we hear it.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.120]   Father, we understand that these are yours.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.400]   And so, God, I pray that you would help me
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.460]   to be clear in the delivering of it.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.540]   Would you allow your word to take root and produce fruit?
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.040]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.920]   Well, we're kind of in the middle here
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.780]   of our covenant series, our tenfold covenant series,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.720]   and these are kind of a stream
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   of just different topical sermons.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   And this is one that the leadership
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.340]   was kind of thinking about, the idea of soberness,
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.980]   something we quite often talk about, I think,
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.620]   here at our church,
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.060]   and this idea of being alert,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.440]   especially in a place and in a world
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.180]   where it's easy to get kind of sleepy.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.340]   And so, I don't think there's anything new in this passage.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.260]   There's a lot of what we already know.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.720]   And the good thing is, this is 1 Peter again.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.940]   Last week, Pastor Peter went into chapter one,
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.380]   and so now we're in chapter five,
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.200]   kind of at the tail end of the book,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.900]   and it's the same people,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.780]   the same people that was being addressed last week
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.080]   is the same people being addressed this week.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.780]   They're aliens, they're sojourners, they're exiles,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.120]   they are people scattered and persecuted.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.700]   And all in all, it's addressing the church,
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.540]   the church that might be prone
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.440]   to kind of flapping around a little bit,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.320]   and especially in the midst of trials,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.520]   especially when you feel like,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.900]   man, I don't belong here in this world
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.080]   because they were migrants.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.460]   And now, this command comes out,
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.260]   this command of being sober, this command of being alert.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.020]   A lot of the Apostle Paul, when you read his epistles,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.580]   you're going to see a lot of his books
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.960]   kind of have this logical flow.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.300]   And the logical flow for Apostle Paul,
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.940]   not Peter here, but Paul,
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.260]   is that the first half, many times,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.960]   is going to be very much kind of indicative-based.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   So he produces lots of truths,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.620]   and then eventually gets into the application.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.220]   Peter actually doesn't function that way.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.500]   If you look through his book,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.040]   1 Peter, through all five chapters,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.720]   what you'll see is his imperatives
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.240]   just scatter all the way through.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.920]   He goes in and out from the imperatives
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.220]   into the indicatives, and back over,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.320]   folding in and in again.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.600]   And so these commands are, many times,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.060]   used as something called the Aorist Imperative.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.720]   There's a long list.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   Maybe one day you could do a personal study on it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.120]   It's pretty fascinating, actually, when you do.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.360]   But these Aorist Imperatives
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.920]   we'll talk about in just a moment.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.020]   But first, let's go into this idea
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.400]   of this call to be sober, this command to be sober.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.700]   The first half of it is, be of sober spirit.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.820]   That's what it says.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.960]   Be of sober spirit.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.040]   So let's define it first.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.860]   Being of sober spirit is to be self-controlled.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.040]   That's largely what it means, to be self-controlled.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.500]   And we have to sit there, pause, and think about that.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.660]   He's saying be self-controlled.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.900]   And that comes with a lot of thought.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.940]   It means to be free of intoxicating influences.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.280]   That's what being self-controlled means.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.400]   So what does this look like?
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.560]   Well, we understand here that this is spiritual in nature.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.240]   Be spiritually sober is what he's saying.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.400]   Be spiritually self-controlled is what he's saying.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.600]   Be spiritually free of intoxicating influences.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.700]   Spiritually, you're in control of your thought process.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.420]   Spiritually, you're in control,
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.580]   or at least not in danger of, irrational thinking.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.720]   Spiritually, you're composed.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   You're behaving with restraint,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.340]   with moderation.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.760]   Spiritually, you're not permitting excess,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.220]   impassions, or rashness.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.760]   And so some diagnostic questions
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.260]   we should always be asking is,
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.300]   we should always be kind of digging up in our lives
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.760]   when we come across imperatives.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.700]   And so I wrote out a few
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.200]   that hopefully some of it would hit home.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.460]   So for you parents, when your kids are acting up
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.860]   for the eighth time that day,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.620]   you're responding out of spiritual soberness.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.140]   When a coworker makes a snarky comment against you,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.580]   you're responding out of spiritual soberness.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.220]   When you have a decision to make at the end of the day
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.920]   as to what to do with your time,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.620]   you're responding in spiritual soberness.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.840]   When someone cuts you off on the road,
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.500]   spiritual soberness.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.300]   This is a question to all of us.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.540]   Are we spiritually controlled?
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.620]   Are we spiritually sober?
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.900]   And that question is so hard
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.380]   because when we cast a wide net
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.940]   and try to figure out in our life,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.380]   in our day-to-day living,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.920]   in my minute-to-minute thinking,
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.220]   spiritual soberness can't quite be aimed at things, right?
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.800]   The question is, are you spiritually sober?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.660]   Do you have the ability in the midst of life
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.940]   to not just have the right theology,
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.140]   but the ability to exercise that theology or that doctrine?
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.100]   Do you have the right spiritual faculties
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.940]   at work inside of you?
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.140]   It's this idea of preaching to yourself
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.420]   rather than listening to yourself,
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.800]   that as soon as the alarm goes off
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.220]   on your phone in the morning,
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.380]   what kicks in?
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.380]   Is it spiritual soberness?
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.880]   Or is the instantaneous reaction going to be
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.780]   part of the opposite?
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.940]   What are the first thoughts in your mind in the morning?
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.420]   Even as you begin your day, where is your attention?
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.500]   At what point does soberness kick in in your day?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:51.580]   So, that first part is be of sober spirit.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.140]   And then there's a second half of this command,
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.480]   be on the alert.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.380]   It's along the same lines,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.380]   the idea is to be watchful or to be vigilant.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.180]   So, what does this look like?
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.420]   Again, this is spiritual alertness,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.080]   spiritual watchfulness, spiritual vigilance.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.540]   You're seeing everything with kind of a kingdom eyes,
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.900]   a gospel-centered eyes,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.240]   or a God-centered God view of the world.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.480]   It's a biblical worldview.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.100]   Again, some diagnostic questions for you,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.580]   you have to ask, because we know this.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.580]   This is a problem, we know these commands.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.980]   And we know we ought to follow these,
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.780]   but we have to put these into our lives.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.500]   When someone asks you, how are you doing spiritually?
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.420]   How do you respond to that?
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.020]   Sometimes the vagueness of how you respond to that question
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.100]   when someone asks you,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.620]   might kind of display your spiritual alertness in your life.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.420]   If you're like, how am I doing spiritually?
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.860]   If you're trying to kind of reach
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.100]   into the corners of your heart,
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.380]   and trying to figure out, what am I struggling with?
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.220]   It might mean that you have not been spiritually alert.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.660]   When you look at a non-believing friend,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.320]   and you feel no sense of urgency or tension,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.060]   it might reveal how alert you are spiritually.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.660]   When you're spending time with brothers and sisters,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.940]   and you don't have the desire to know
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.340]   how their walk has been, and instead,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.380]   there's this group that I'm a part of at Berean,
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.620]   it's a Dodgers-Berean chat.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.900]   We talk all the time, because right now,
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.540]   the winter meeting's just closed,
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.220]   and there's all these trades happening,
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.820]   and then signings of free agents,
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.320]   and I'm like, man, we talk for a long time
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.460]   on that chat group sometimes.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.660]   And sometimes I wonder, I sit back and I wonder,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.580]   man, I wonder how this guy's doing spiritually.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.740]   Do I care?
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.640]   Again, in dealing with children,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.400]   if your primary objective is to get them to behave
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.040]   and conform to household rules,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.600]   it's possible that our spiritual alertness
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.360]   and awareness is off,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.480]   where our victory is when they obey, or when they behave.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.720]   When we see the news, the politics,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.760]   and we react viscerally from the flesh,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.280]   where you feel like, oh, darkness,
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.400]   and there's hopelessness, or something like that,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.520]   the spiritual alertness is off.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.040]   So these commands are that, it's to be on the alert,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.480]   it's to be aware, it's to be ready, or on guard,
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.240]   that when you view the world, just generally speaking,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.560]   you're able to be sober in your view and understanding
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.720]   of how things are working.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.800]   Because we are prone to the opposite, this is C.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   We are prone to the opposite,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.640]   that's why he gives these commands.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.320]   If we weren't prone to the opposite,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.920]   he would not give these commands.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.240]   So this is important for us to recognize,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.280]   that the proneness in our flesh,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.600]   you know that song, Prone to Wander, it's there,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.760]   there's a proneness to not be sober, to not be alert.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.160]   What is the opposite of sober?
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's to be drunk or inebriated.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.400]   It's to be under intoxicating influences.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.520]   We're not thinking clearly.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.280]   Our spiritual judgment has been impaired.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.120]   We've lost control over ourselves.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:28.960]   If we are supposed to discipline ourselves
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.440]   for the purpose of godliness, we've lost discipline.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.200]   We've lost the goal of our lives.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.000]   The opposite of alert is distracted.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.880]   It's sleepy or asleep.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.720]   And especially in this season, it's very easy.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.640]   In the simple decisions we make, our spiritual sobriety,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.400]   our alertness is put to the test.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.360]   In this season, it's really easy to get swept up.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   And there is this idea that if we sit still,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.840]   we will get swept away.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.080]   And I like this idea of mission statement.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.840]   A lot of companies have mission statements.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.720]   And it's something like, honestly, all people have.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   Everyone has some kind of mission statement in life.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.440]   We all live living out something that has to do
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   with what we would deem to be our mission.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.520]   That is, that we act upon what we deem
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.760]   to be the goal in our life.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.960]   That's where our actions come from.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.640]   And if every believer in this room,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.520]   if we were all to sit, pull out a piece of paper,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.000]   grab a pen, and we all wrote out our mission statement,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   for every believer, ours would sound very similar.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.640]   Our mission statement is to live for God's glory.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.080]   Our mission statement is to live for His kingdom.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.120]   Our mission statement is to love God with all of our hearts,
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.280]   to go after His purposes, His goals, and not mine.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.080]   Actually, my goals come into conformity with His goals.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.920]   My will comes into conformity with His will.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.080]   There is no personal self kingdom building in my life.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.960]   That is my mission statement.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.380]   It's His kingdom.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:23.560]   The mission statement says your goal and purpose,
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.640]   and so that's our question.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.840]   What is my goal and what is my purpose in life?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   What is the reason that I live?
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.400]   What do you deem to be most important in your life?
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   Again, ours would align.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.920]   However, how much do your everyday thoughts,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.420]   actions, attitudes, decisions,
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.920]   fall in line with what you wrote down?
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.120]   And that is where you're going to see soberness,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.960]   or lack thereof.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.240]   That is where you're going to see,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.800]   if I'm making these decisions,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.880]   but this is what I want to live for,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.640]   if these don't line up, we've lost soberness.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.520]   We've lost alertness.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.020]   We are inebriated.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.680]   We are drunk on some kind of intoxicating influence
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.000]   of the flesh through the world,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.760]   under the control and influence of the enemy.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   2 Peter chapter one, verse eight says this.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.480]   There's some other stuff around this,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.640]   but I'm just gonna read this.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.240]   It says, "For if these qualities are yours
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.520]   "and are increasing, they render you neither useless
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.840]   "nor unfruitful in the true knowledge
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.680]   "of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.560]   So a whole list of things that Peter listed out
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.200]   before this in 2 Peter.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.360]   But he says, "If these qualities that I previously listed
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.960]   "are increasing, and if they're yours,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.520]   "then, listen, they render you neither useless
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.800]   "nor unfruitful."
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.880]   Again, inductive study, a really good thing to do
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.760]   is just flip it around.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   The flip around here is, then,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.000]   there is a possibility for people
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.720]   to be useless and unfruitful.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.960]   The Christian can be rendered useless.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.520]   The Christian can be rendered unfruitful.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.800]   But he says here, if the qualities,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.200]   again, we're not gonna go into those qualities,
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.720]   this is right before this passage.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.600]   "But if these qualities are yours and are increasing,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.120]   "you will not be useless, you will not be unfruitful
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.040]   "in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.760]   In verse nine, "For he who lacks these qualities
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.800]   "is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.760]   "his purification from his former sins.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.960]   "Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent."
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.600]   That's another discipline word here.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.640]   "To make certain about his calling and choosing you
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.200]   "for as long as you practice these things."
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.760]   Again, this action-oriented thing here,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.560]   "You practice these things, you will never stumble.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.920]   "For in this way, the entrance into the eternal kingdom
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.600]   "of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.800]   "will be abundantly supplied to you."
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.160]   See, there is this thing where we're called
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.880]   to actively pursue and to actively live
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.160]   in a sober type of living and thinking.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.960]   See, right now, every day, there's a new deal
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.520]   on something to purchase.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.680]   And so, of course, we know, we all know the drill here.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.160]   It's not wrong to buy things.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.440]   It's not wrong to desire things, even.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.920]   But what we purchase, or even if we don't purchase,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.560]   you know, we're sitting there and you sit there
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.040]   for like five hours contemplating,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.680]   should I buy this or not?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.240]   Regardless of all that stuff,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.040]   they become kind of indicators in our lives
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.720]   of what we're consumed over, where our attention is,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.760]   where we see our heart struggling, battling, contemplating.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.480]   So when we see the subject of our contemplation
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.160]   through the day, it might reveal our sobriety
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.520]   and our alertness.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.320]   A lot of college students in the season of final exams
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.600]   could be tested.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.040]   In a season where our children are headed
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   towards the long winter breaks, could be tested.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.240]   In a season where we're going to spend a lot of time
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.040]   with family members we don't see all that often,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.160]   we can be tested.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.760]   Right now, there are just so many holiday parties.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.960]   Sometimes, even in the midst of church,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.160]   there's so many holiday parties.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.400]   I just have to cook all the time for this polygon,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.840]   that polygon, I got to go buy a gift for this gift exchange,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.720]   that white elephant gift exchange.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.280]   Our hearts are tested.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.880]   We lose soberness in these things.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.680]   What consumes our attention from the moment we wake?
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.120]   What distracts us?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.400]   What causes us to veer into sinful attitudes?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.760]   What do we complain about?
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.000]   What does that display about our own personal
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.280]   mission statement and your adherence to it?
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.440]   So now, if we're to look at our lives,
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.480]   and we listed out what we're actually living for,
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.120]   and we just write it all out, and we hand that paper over
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.320]   to a brother or sister and said,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.960]   "Hey, read this list and write out what you think
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.480]   "the mission statement of this person is."
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:14.600]   See, these types of things might be things in our lives
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   that inebriate us, draws us into intoxicating influences,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.280]   distracts us, makes us sleepy Christians,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.880]   and we lose sharpness.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.480]   But we understand it's not our circumstances.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.920]   It's not Christmas.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.200]   We know that for the drunkard, alcohol isn't the problem.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.040]   It's the man.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's his control.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.800]   And for us, ultimately, it's not the situation we're in
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   that's to blame.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.160]   It's not our circumstance that causes us to lose soberness.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.120]   We are called to be sober people.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.880]   It's not an unfair professor.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.880]   It's not a misbehaving child.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.440]   It's not a mean-spirited coworker.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.600]   It's not financial downturn.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600]   It's not a health condition
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.480]   that causes us to lose soberness.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.800]   See, it could be negative circumstances.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   It could be positive circumstances.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.360]   All circumstances can cause us to lose perspective,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.080]   can cause us to lose soberness.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   For you to be sober, your heart must be sober.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.040]   And so, Peter issues this command from our God.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.560]   He says, "Be of sober spirit.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.920]   "Be on the alert."
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.400]   We talk about this so much here at our church,
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.480]   and I love it.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   I loved it.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.760]   From the moment I got here two years ago, I loved it.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.200]   And people just, I'll talk to this person,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.480]   "I wanna be more sober-minded.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.320]   "I wanna be sober-minded."
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.160]   I'm like, "What?
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.000]   "You're not sober-minded?"
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.840]   I'm like, "No, I'm sober-minded."
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.680]   I'm like, "No, I'm sober-minded."
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.880]   I'm like, "I wanna be more sober-minded."
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.840]   I'm like, "Man, this is awesome."
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.560]   I talk to this person, "I wanna be more sober-minded."
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.240]   "Yes, man, I love being here."
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.720]   We talk about this a lot,
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   that we're called to be sober-minded,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.160]   but we have need to really again and again and again
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.720]   and again apply this principle to ourselves.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.200]   Have we been spiritually sober,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   or have we been spiritually drunk?
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.840]   You know that idea of drunk dialing?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.280]   So you're not using good judgment
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   and you say some dumb things.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.960]   How has your spiritual judgment been?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.160]   Have you been making decisions
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.360]   that are quite honestly spiritually dumb?
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.640]   Have you been making decisions
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.560]   that are not using good and sound judgment?
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.480]   Have you been spiritually not alert?
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.440]   Have you been spiritually distracted?
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.080]   Is something or someone taking your eyes off of Christ?
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.320]   Have you been spiritually asleep?
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.880]   And we know this, and we know this,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.320]   and we know that we can even maybe identify
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   some of these things in our lives
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.240]   that we're struggling with.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   And we can evaluate ourselves and say,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.320]   "Yes, there are places, there are things,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.840]   "and I can write it down, and I can share it,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.400]   "and I can tell my brothers and sisters
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.040]   "that these are things I'm actually struggling with,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.240]   "that I am not sober in this arena of my life.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.160]   "We're very good at it, and I get encouraged by it,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.880]   "but it is not enough."
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.240]   If we know it, and if we talk about it too much,
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.360]   and we ask for prayer requests,
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.480]   and if that's where it ends,
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.120]   what concerns me today is how much do we apply it?
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.480]   It's great that we know it,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.400]   but what is the active application of it?
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   And the reason why I bring this up is because of myself.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.480]   Since February, we've been going through
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.320]   the book of Hebrews.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.760]   Pastor Peter Kim has been preaching
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.160]   through the book of Hebrews.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.840]   I wanted to see, I wanted to see how many sermons he did,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.800]   so I went back and counted.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.160]   27 sermons through Hebrews already.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.520]   Crazy how fast that goes, right?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.280]   27 sermons.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.760]   And much of it, I know, we cling to in our minds.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.160]   Do you know how I know?
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.000]   I have heard probably over 100 times already,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.680]   like, "I'm afraid that I'm drifting."
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.920]   I'm like, "Wow, that's Pastor Peter Kim language."
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.640]   Like, he said that in his sermons.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   You probably have said that, right?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.320]   You probably shared that.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.200]   I'm, that's, the odds are you have.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.800]   I'm afraid of that spiritual drifting.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:30.760]   The most important thing here, though,
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.720]   is that this knowledge has caused in us change.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.400]   Here's some of the sermon titles
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.760]   Pastor Peter went through.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.840]   March, do not neglect your salvation.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.400]   Another one in March, do not drift.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.680]   That's where it came from.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.800]   In June, he went through three weeks
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.640]   of the warning signs of the apostate.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.480]   Remember that one?
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.000]   That one was like cut to the heart.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.040]   In August, he preached a sermon called,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.560]   Let Us Hold Fast.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.080]   In September, he preached a sermon called,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.160]   Moving Beyond Spiritual Infancy.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.520]   And so, we have all of these things.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.160]   And I know, just travel with me,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.640]   like, if we get into this time machine we have here,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.680]   and we travel back into March, for example,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.880]   where he preached on the, like, not spiritually drifting.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.800]   If you can look back at your sermon notes,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.320]   and scan down to your personal application for that sermon,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.560]   the question to us is not how much did that affect us,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.040]   or how much did that cause our theology
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.440]   or doctrine to kind of change,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.280]   it's how much has that actually caused change in our lives,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.480]   in our decision making.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.560]   When we see the things that we knew we have to surrender,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   today, eight months later, have you surrendered it?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.480]   Has something changed?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.520]   And I think, I'm just so encouraged,
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.480]   because for many of us, there has been great change.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.440]   I've been very encouraged.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.960]   And I know these truths of God's word
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.360]   have personally caused in me change as well.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.400]   But, if there hasn't been change,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.200]   and you feel the same conviction week after week,
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.320]   and you're like, haven't I heard this sermon
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.240]   from Pastor Peter before?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.640]   Why is it hurting so good again?
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.560]   Why is it convicting me and cutting me so deep again?
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.480]   And if it's the same thing week after week,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.800]   just, oh, that's good conviction,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.920]   oh, that's good stuff, oh, that's awesome.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.080]   But nothing changes.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.560]   That's scary.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.280]   If you're asking the question, is that good or bad
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.000]   that you're being convicted like that every week?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.760]   I would actually say it's bad.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.040]   Because that might be an indicator
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.200]   that you are not in obedience.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.320]   You might be in disobedience.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.440]   Week after week, getting cut to the heart.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.200]   Week after week, not much changing.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.080]   You've lost soberness.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.640]   You've lost sound spiritual judgment.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.960]   And so we've become master spiritual compartmentalizers.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.880]   And we were able to, in places and portions of our lives,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.560]   live out our convictions.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.800]   And we're able to say, though we're not living sober here,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.160]   though we are not actually actively living out
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.520]   our convictions here, that we can come to our brothers
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.120]   and sisters, sit around in a circle,
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.840]   and talk about the fact that we're struggling with that.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.040]   Week after week.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.320]   And even for those of us who are actively applying,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.960]   actively crucifying the flesh,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   actively seeking the Lord and denying the flesh,
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.840]   the call to us is, we need more of this.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.000]   We need to apply this idea of sobriety
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.960]   not just to parts of our lives, but to our entire lives.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.000]   It needs to be the way we think.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.360]   From the moment we wake up, this is the way we need to live.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   This is our mindset, is what we learn
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.920]   through the book of Philippians.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.800]   That's that word phrenel, it's a mindset
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   that we live as Christians, we have the mindset of Christ.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.120]   And so it doesn't matter if it's a negative experience
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.840]   or a positive experience.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.400]   Now when Pastor Mark was teaching through that,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.680]   that stuck with me.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.640]   That it flips upside down, that the Christian worldview
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.360]   is so different from the non-Christian worldview.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.280]   That is for us, our evaluation of what is good
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.920]   and what is bad is very different.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.860]   It doesn't matter about circumstantial things.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.920]   It's Christ.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.720]   Whether he's exalted.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   And so, have we been like this?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.480]   If we're distracted by something in our lives,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.540]   like are we trying to just apply soberness to that thing?
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:48.240]   I know I heard some people after certain sermons,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.360]   they went home and deleted Netflix.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.720]   Canceled their Netflix account.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.000]   You know what happens when you direct soberness at Netflix.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.560]   YouTube happens.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.720]   That's what happens.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.640]   You direct soberness here, and boop, this pops up.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.740]   You go here, and then boop, this pops up.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.600]   Why?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.500]   Because we are not called to spiritually
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.920]   compartmentalize this thing.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's an entire mindset overhaul.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.640]   Your entire worldview is just transformed.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.080]   The old has gone, the new has come.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.200]   We're different.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.940]   So we can't aim it.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.440]   We can't just say like, I'm going to be self-controlled here.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.920]   I have to be more self-controlled here.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.280]   It's that from the moment we wake up,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   we need to be self-controlled people.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.100]   We need to be sober people.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:45.400]   So again, it's never about the thing, the situation,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.720]   the circumstance, the relationship, whatever.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.600]   We're called to have sober hearts.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.000]   Soberness is called to be continual
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.760]   and constant and consistent.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.400]   Our every day must be filled with it.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   We know that sin and selfishness and pride
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.240]   is knocking on the door, and so we're aware of it.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.360]   We're alert.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.680]   If you feel the temptation of the flesh,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.480]   you should not feel guilty about it.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.720]   Why?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.280]   Because the Bible says that's going to be the case
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.840]   for the rest of our lives here.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.280]   So what Paul is saying here is,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.320]   not to say like, the flesh is going to be gone.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.160]   That's not the goal.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.920]   Like, the eradication of temptation, that's not the goal.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.720]   It's going to be there.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.520]   He says, be alert.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.600]   He says, be sober.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.560]   He says, these things are close.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:50.480]   These commands, again, they're given
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.240]   in the aorist imperative.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.000]   Aorist is typically seen as past tense, but it's not.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.680]   And so it's interesting, it's not just past tense.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.440]   When you put an aorist with a command,
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.400]   that kind of feels like,
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.960]   how do you do a past tense command, right?
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.040]   So the reason why an aorist imperative is very interesting
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.960]   is because what it does is it puts a giant force
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.120]   on the past, that this is a command and a truth
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.160]   that is given to you from the moment you're saved.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.180]   And then, if that was a stake in the ground,
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.640]   that this is your truth, that you are called to be sober,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.360]   that you are called to be alert
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.860]   as soon as you become a believer,
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.100]   that this stakes into the ground
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.680]   every time you see this command.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.320]   At every moment and every juncture of your life,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.280]   this command is calling out to us to obey.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.600]   It's constant, it's continuous, it's moving.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.700]   It's different than a present imperative.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.280]   This one has this idea of a past truth,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.860]   just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.120]   This is who we are.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.460]   In 1 Thessalonians chapter five, verse one,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.580]   Paul says that we are children of the light.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.740]   Let me read this for us.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.100]   Now, it's the times and the epics.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.760]   Brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you,
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.380]   for you yourselves know full well
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.780]   that the day of the Lord will come
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.380]   just like a thief in the night.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.300]   While they are saying, "Peace and safety,"
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.100]   then destruction will come upon them suddenly
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.140]   like labor pains upon a woman with child,
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.540]   and they will not escape.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.020]   But you, brethren, are not in darkness,
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.900]   that the day would overcome you like a thief,
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.140]   for you are all sons of light and sons of day.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.820]   We are not of night nor of darkness,
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.260]   so then let us not sleep as others do,
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.860]   but let us be alert and sober.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.100]   For those who sleep do their sleeping at night,
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.020]   and those who get drunk get drunk at night.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.260]   But since we are of the day, let us be sober,
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.220]   having put on the breastplate of faith and love
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.300]   and as a helmet the hope of salvation.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.220]   For God has not destined us for wrath,
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.140]   but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.140]   who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep,
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.980]   we will live together with him.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.700]   Therefore, encourage one another
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.880]   and build up one another just as you are doing.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.740]   So this passage tells us who we are not.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.780]   We are not people of the night.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.700]   We are children of the day.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.380]   That's what this passage says.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.580]   It's not just spiritual betterment
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.500]   or spiritual self-help we're talking about
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.880]   that we ought to be sober and alert.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.180]   This is who we are.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.540]   It's not just a good suggestion.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.480]   It's entirely contrary to who we are.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:23.060]   It actually ought to be very, very disturbing
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.960]   when we find ourselves acting like children of the night.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.660]   It should be very disturbing when we're acting like people
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.240]   who say, "Peace and safety,"
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.980]   forgetting that judgment is coming.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.220]   When we know that everything we see around us
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.260]   is passing away, and yet we're so enamored
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.580]   with the things of this world, that's very disturbing.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.780]   That is not who we are.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:52.360]   And so when we are enamored by the things of this world,
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.900]   that we say with our minds and with our lips
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.560]   that everything is going away,
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.300]   everything will go through God's judgment.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.020]   Only eternal things will be found in Christ will remain.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.040]   And yet, if our lifestyle, if our decisions that we make,
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.900]   if the things we partake in does not fall in line
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.580]   with what we believe, that the world is passing away,
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.900]   that people are dying,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.460]   it's disturbing.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.680]   It's not just better to not live like that.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.720]   It's not just spiritual, personal betterment.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.040]   I, ah, this is not good.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.400]   I know I should do better.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.480]   It's wrong.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.240]   It's scary.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.800]   It's very frightening.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.640]   And the enemy here, we talk about, you know,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.980]   that kind of the SoCal or type of Christianity,
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.960]   the enemy lives in that territory.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.280]   We look just like the world.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   It's so, so sad.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.980]   Actually, I think many of us,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.340]   in the decisions we make, we confuse the world.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:02.180]   They're like, that doesn't make sense, you know?
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:07.260]   We dilute the power of God's message in our lives,
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.840]   in our living testimonies.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.620]   We are children of the light, not the dark.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.220]   And actually, we are called to shine into the darkness.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.880]   In Ephesians chapter five, verse seven, it says,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.280]   "Therefore, do not be partakers with them."
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.040]   That's the world.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.140]   "For you were formerly darkness,
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.240]   "but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.080]   "Walk as children of light."
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.360]   That's so weird.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.420]   You are light.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.740]   Walk as that.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.580]   Trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.520]   Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness,
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.300]   but instead, even expose them.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.260]   "For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.760]   "which are done by them in secret,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.880]   "but all things become visible
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.960]   "when they are exposed by the light.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   "For everything that becomes visible is light.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.880]   "For this reason, it says,
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.220]   "awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.400]   "and Christ will shine on you."
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.440]   I love this passage, because what it's calling
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.200]   the Christian to do is to shine into the darkness.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.260]   And I think, I fear sometimes, when we're not being sober,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.360]   what happens is, again, we come over and over and over again
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.680]   into our circles of Christians,
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.400]   and what we do is we go around in a circle
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.900]   and talk about our sin, much too much.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.240]   Over and over and over again.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.600]   When we are called to live as children of light
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.040]   into darkness, we are the light.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.640]   If we're constantly talking about how we're living
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.680]   in the darkness, there's something wrong.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.320]   We're called to go and be the light to a dark world.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.080]   We know that people are dying around us.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.920]   Are we sober-minded enough to see this?
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   And if we agree to this,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.600]   if we're saying that we can see this clearly,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.380]   how do you act upon it?
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.360]   This brings us to our second and final point here.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.600]   The enemy is prowling.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.480]   This is an additional reason for soberness that he gives.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.540]   The enemy is prowling.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.960]   In 1 Peter, chapter five, verse eight,
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.800]   if we look there again, it says,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.440]   "Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.000]   "like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.600]   Now the question is, what does this look like, though?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.920]   Does Satan come and bite us?
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.520]   Obviously not.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.880]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.520]   What does it mean that he's prowling around?
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.400]   What does it mean for him to devour us, to get us?
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.800]   He tricked us, is it that?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.240]   And it's kind of that.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.400]   He uses deceit to get us spiritually.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.520]   And we know that we can't be fooled
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.080]   unless you're not being sober.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.840]   See, the enemy, he never sleeps.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:48.920]   His desire, day and night, with every breath he has,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.000]   is to do this, is to prowl around and devour.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.840]   He is thinking at every moment how he can devour us,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.040]   devour people.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Right now, there is a facet where the enemy
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.560]   is trying to find an open place where he can get you.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.160]   And he never sleeps in this.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.640]   He's constantly thinking on better and better strategies.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.040]   He sees, wow, okay, he deleted Netflix.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.720]   Easy, YouTube.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.880]   The enemy is constantly thinking.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.280]   He's thinking, oh, health condition in his family.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.580]   I see an opening.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.680]   He's seeing, oh, this guy got a raise.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.080]   Oh, I see a big opening.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.400]   See, he's prowling.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.240]   He takes no breaks.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.560]   He takes no vacations.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.080]   He takes no holidays.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.400]   He doesn't sleep.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.160]   Speaking of mission statements, man,
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.200]   at least he lives out his mission, right?
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.880]   He's prowling when we're at work,
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.940]   and he's prowling at the end of a long day of work at home.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.360]   He's prowling when we're on vacation
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.240]   and when we're at Disneyland.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.280]   He's prowling when we're hanging out
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.720]   with our friends in groups
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.840]   or when we're alone in our rooms.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.280]   He's prowling in the midst of our relationships.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:21.980]   He's there, and this is our spiritual reality.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.940]   That's what Peter is saying here.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.880]   And looking at this, we can do that inductive study thing
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.040]   again, try flipping it around on its head.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.980]   Peter commands us to resist the enemy.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.640]   So what might it look like if we don't resist him?
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.300]   (sighing)
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:43.620]   Well, I think that's when the believer is rendered useless.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.100]   That's why it says here, though,
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.520]   we are to resist him firm in our faith.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.700]   What if there was like a cage right here
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.720]   with this giant lion that was like untamed, you know?
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.680]   And then I sat here, and then I opened up this cage,
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.060]   and I ran, ran out that door.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.800]   Like, and you guys are talking with each other,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.920]   and then you see this lion slowly come out.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.600]   You go, "Oh, lion," and then you continue
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.480]   to just talk with the person right next to you, right?
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.640]   Oh, yeah, those Lakers, huh?
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.400]   Doing pretty well.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.900]   Oh, yeah, did you get that deal on Slick Deals?
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.160]   You have all these things you're just talking about.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.160]   No one would do that, right?
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.620]   All of a sudden, every pair of eyes
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.200]   would be whoop right there, right?
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.520]   And everyone would be like tense.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.420]   Every hair on your head would be whoop.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.480]   And that's actually, I think,
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.320]   the thing he's trying to get at here.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.540]   He's saying the enemy's prowling.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:47.480]   There needs to be no command to be sober.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.240]   It's responsive.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.120]   But he's saying, in your flesh, you're forgetting.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.520]   He's there.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.320]   And so we must resist the enemy.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.840]   How do you resist him?
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.240]   Do you just say, getting together
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.040]   in a one-on-one meetup with someone,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.640]   say like, "I want to resist."
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:18.760]   Yeah, I want to resist.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.160]   Is that how you resist?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.640]   The call is to actually fight against.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.000]   It's not like someone trying to get you,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.400]   you know, like when you think of someone
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.000]   trying to get you to eat another slice of cake,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.200]   sometimes that happens at the end of our potlucks, right?
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.880]   So all this food, there's always that one person
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.840]   that comes and says, "Eat this."
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.440]   You know, you're trying to get rid of all the food.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.320]   "Hey, eat this."
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.520]   And it's like, you know that person who goes like,
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.920]   "Oh, no, no, no, no."
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.840]   But the person who's going around knows weak people.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.480]   They see the opening and they go like,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   "It's okay."
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   And they go, "All right, all right."
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   Just eat it, right?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.360]   But the active resistance that we're talking about here,
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.440]   this word can be translated, resistance,
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.200]   the word can be translated to show hostility against.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.560]   Okay, so it's like someone comes up and says, "Cake."
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.000]   And you say, "Go away."
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.720]   "Get behind me."
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.160]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.280]   Don't say that last part.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.960]   But this is the type of resistance that we're talking about,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.600]   to show hostility against, to hate him, to hate his schemes.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   We're talking about the enemy now, so.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.600]   Ultimately, it's to hate anything anti-God.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.640]   It's to look at anti-God things and hate it.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.760]   Hostility against it.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.680]   This is soberness.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.800]   This is active resistance.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.400]   This is alertness.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.960]   It takes work.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.480]   You cannot relax in this tension.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.520]   It's like someone saying like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.800]   Like, they're like, "I'm gonna run this half marathon."
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.600]   You're like, "Wow, you're gonna run a half marathon?"
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.440]   Like, "You?
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.760]   "You're gonna run a half marathon?"
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.320]   Like, "I'm gonna run a half marathon."
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.520]   And then like, they're like, "Okay,
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.880]   "you're gonna run a half marathon."
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.600]   And then, like, you go run your half marathon,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.680]   and you run like half a mile, and you come out,
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.440]   and you're like, "Did you run the half marathon?"
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.360]   You're like, "Oh, man, I only got half a mile in."
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.280]   You're like, "Why'd you stop?"
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.440]   Like, "It hurt."
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.560]   Like, "It was really tiring."
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.360]   And you're like, "Oh, my goodness."
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:21.760]   Like, we have to have this idea of like,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.600]   "I know what I'm getting into here."
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   Like, do we resist him?
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   Like, are we relaxing in our attention?
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.640]   Are you actually struggling,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.560]   like, from the spiritual perspective,
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.400]   or has it been half-hearted for you?
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.880]   Has it been a lot of sharing in small groups
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:49.240]   that I'm struggling with this, and we go,
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.680]   it's half-hearted attention.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.080]   And we go, and it's a half-hearted attempt of like,
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.920]   "Ah, shit."
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.080]   Two weeks later, you come back, and you say,
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.920]   "Hey, how's that been?"
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.320]   It's like, "Oh, a little better."
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.360]   And you use these little spiritual loopholes of like,
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.240]   "It got a little bit better.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.560]   "I tried a little bit harder."
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.640]   And you use the cleverness of your speech
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   to kind of iron and smooth it out.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.320]   And you say, "But I know."
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.560]   And then you use the secondary,
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.400]   like, kind of the reverse psychology spirituality, like,
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.320]   "But I still have a long way to go."
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.520]   You know, and like, it actually enhances
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.240]   to like, the spiritual view that someone has upon you.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.680]   And you know, you go around,
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.080]   and you're going around and around in this.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.600]   But are you actively struggling?
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.040]   Are you really fighting and resisting
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   and showing hostility against things that are anti-God?
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.240]   Is it active?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.640]   Are you fighting, not just saying, "I should do better."
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.280]   When someone shares with you
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.480]   that they're struggling with something,
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.120]   you should never think, "Cool, they're just,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.960]   "they're being vulnerable.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.440]   "This is great."
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.880]   And just leave it at that,
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.840]   but you should actually sit there and try to evaluate,
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.760]   is there real struggle there in what they're sharing?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.440]   If you're sharing with someone
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.720]   something you've been struggling,
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.480]   ask yourself that before you say,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.840]   "I'm struggling with this sin."
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.480]   Ask yourself, "Am I really struggling?
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.200]   "Am I kicking against it?
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.880]   "Am I resisting?
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.000]   "Or am I just sharing something
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.480]   "that I've actively not been fighting against in my life?"
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.400]   Again, to come back to February and March
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   when we hear the dangers of drifting,
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:24.200]   did these sermons simply identify the state we're in?
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.400]   And that's it.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:33.200]   And now I can articulate in spiritual words
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.440]   to a deeper spiritual degree
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.360]   that I am not a sober person.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.480]   And we sit there.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.440]   Has there been progress?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.040]   Has there been change in your life?
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.640]   Because if there hasn't, it's called disobedience.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.040]   It can be just like the spiritual compartmentalizing
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:57.880]   we talked about before,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.480]   that we have conviction week after week,
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.040]   but there's no real resistance,
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.400]   no real struggle, no real hostility.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   Knowing it's wrong, being able to identify it.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.280]   But until there's surrender, there is no soberness.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.920]   You see, surrender isn't surrender
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.560]   until you actually surrender.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.520]   You can say you want to surrender to the Lord
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.360]   and resist the enemy,
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.160]   but until you actually do it,
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.760]   have you really surrendered?
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.080]   In your honesty, in something you know
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.560]   that you need to change in your life right now,
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.160]   you can totally sit there and be okay.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   And think, maybe the problem is that you're,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.200]   I'm just straddling the fence.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.000]   But straddling the fence is actually just living
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   in opposition and rebellion before God.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Straddling the fence is the same thing
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.400]   as outright rebellion.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.840]   If you are not surrendering,
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.960]   and if you are not submitting,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.920]   you are in hostility towards God.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.200]   That's what it means in James 4.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.760]   Friendship with the world is hostility towards God.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.480]   Praise the Lord we have Christ and his work for us.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.160]   But yet, this is a scary thing for us.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.680]   I think what's scarier than sharp, outright,
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.960]   like rebellion against God is this kind of rebellion.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.520]   So scary, tucking away the truths that we know.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.160]   I saw, I forgot who wrote it,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.880]   but just the title of an article was very intriguing to me.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.720]   It said, "The dangers of not atheism, but apathyism."
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.520]   I was like, man, yeah, that's what we struggle with.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.960]   See, looking at this verse then,
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.240]   1 Peter 5, "Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.400]   "Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.120]   "seeking someone to devour, but resist him.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.320]   "Firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.840]   "of suffering are being accomplished
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.000]   "by your brethren who are in the world."
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.200]   Let me end with some application.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.640]   The first application is this.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.320]   If you wanna, just kinda, let me just start you on the road.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.840]   And it's a different passage, and I'm not going to read it,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.600]   but the idea of permissible versus beneficial things
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.280]   I think is very helpful
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.720]   in understanding how to live soberly.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.120]   So, focus on beneficial things, not permissible things.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.080]   When you get stuck on permissible things,
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.320]   that is, like, am I allowed to enjoy
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.160]   these things in my life?
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.420]   What's the answer to that?
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.280]   Yes, of course you're allowed
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.040]   to enjoy the things of this life.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.040]   But the problem is, when you're asking that question,
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.880]   generally you're not coming from a sober-minded place.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   You're coming more from a self-centered place
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.920]   and trying to get towards the middle
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.180]   of spiritual appropriateness.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.460]   So, don't focus on permissible things.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.440]   You have to stay laser-focused on beneficial things.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.920]   So, when you're focused on permissible things,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.760]   you're not sober.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.180]   When you're focused on beneficial things,
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.200]   what is helpful in my walk?
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.960]   Those are the things that show that you're being sober.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:07.040]   Beneficial, when you're focused on beneficial things,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.200]   so you're all about God's work,
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.440]   God's kingdom, and God's will.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.600]   That's the way you're focusing, the beneficial things.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.200]   When you're focusing on permissible things,
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.840]   many times you're focusing on your self-work,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.320]   self-kingdom, and self-will.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.240]   So, when you ask that question,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.520]   what is causing insobriety in your life?
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.000]   The question is not, am I allowed to do this?
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.840]   The better question is,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.640]   does this honor and glorify the Lord?
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.560]   Will this help in that endeavor?
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.320]   Does it further what I believe,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.520]   or does it actually do the opposite?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.040]   Are the permissible things in my life
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.900]   causing me to fall asleep?
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.760]   Are they causing me to grow slowly intoxicated
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.800]   by the things of this world?
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.840]   And in that, permissible things have become
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.220]   kind of this quiet, scary, drifting things.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.740]   What was, at one point, permissible,
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.120]   has become downright dishonoring to the Lord.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:02.920]   We live a whitewashed life and existence,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.340]   serving the church, attending Bible studies,
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.880]   general personal devotions,
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.840]   covering over all of this.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:18.560]   Our entire mindset, our entire worldview and base desires
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.360]   need to be that of soberness and alertness.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.000]   Just to give you a quick example,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.300]   you know, I was a youth pastor for about seven years,
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.360]   and during those seven years,
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.340]   the youth students, raging hormone days, right?
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.360]   You remember those days,
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.080]   and so everybody just feels like
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.840]   they fell in love with someone every other week.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.240]   And so they'll come up, and they're like,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.080]   "I'm dating."
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   I'm like, "Oh my gosh, okay, all right,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.120]   "so you're dating, all right."
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.560]   Say, and they go like, "So, Pastor Nathan,
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.760]   "how far can I go before it's like sinful?"
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.100]   Like, "What do you mean how far can you go?
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.200]   "What are you talking about?"
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.480]   (laughing)
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.400]   And they go, "You know, you know,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.160]   "can I like hold her hand?"
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.040]   I'm like, "You fool."
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:50:59.880]   (laughing)
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.580]   That's what I think, but outside, I go like,
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.080]   "Oh, okay, oh, what do you mean?"
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.000]   (laughing)
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.840]   That's the reality versus, you know,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.360]   and then he says like, "Can I kiss her?"
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.680]   And you know, on and on, and when you see that,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.960]   that's what we're talking about here.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.760]   Like, it's so silly, because when I see them,
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.720]   you know, that's the feeling I get,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.520]   and then I realize very quickly,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.120]   you know what happens in ministry all the time?
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.680]   Like, whenever you're ministering to someone
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.480]   that's like kind of younger than you or whatever,
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.280]   and you're talking to them, you're like,
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.440]   "Oh my goodness, this is so annoying."
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.020]   And then you turn, and you go like,
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.240]   "Oh my gosh, I'm just like this."
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.440]   You know, like, God is just like,
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.040]   nothing like being a parent that does that.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.480]   You're like, "Stop it!"
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   And then you turn, and you go like, "Oh."
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.700]   And you gotta repent to God, because you're like,
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.500]   "This is exactly what I look like."
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.200]   Man, I live in the permissible.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.280]   You know, I'm like sitting there, and going like,
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   "God, can I do this?"
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.440]   Yeah, it's okay, right?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.080]   And then just asking that question,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.960]   already I've lost it all, right?
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.560]   So here are some good questions to ask.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.360]   Will it benefit me spiritually?
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.720]   Will it bring bondage?
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.800]   Will it defile God's temple?
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.040]   Will it cause anyone to stumble?
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.520]   Will it further the cost of evangelism?
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.040]   Will it violate my conscience?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.120]   Will it bring glory to God?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.480]   These are good questions.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.960]   These are beneficial things,
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.740]   and that is the way we need to live.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.060]   Secondly, and lastly, the church must be of one mind in this.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.700]   There's a danger, the greatest danger
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.680]   is when collectively as a church,
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.060]   we allow the permissible things to become,
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:31.900]   like, okay.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.480]   I said that wrong.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.040]   We allow things that draw us into insobriety
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.280]   is permissible.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.360]   So as a church, because of our culture,
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.360]   and we say, "Of course it's okay to do this."
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:50.880]   And so that as a church, we put a stamp of approval on it,
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.900]   saying, "These things are okay, and these things are not."
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.720]   So you can buy these types of cars, but not these types.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.120]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.180]   So there's this idea of the church,
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.360]   but we need to stay sharp in this together being sober.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.880]   So again, the idea is we need to be sober together.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.920]   We need to ask good questions of each other.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.040]   We need to encourage each other,
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.200]   and we need to sharpen each other,
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.040]   and we need to prod each other.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.560]   We need to ask uncomfortable questions towards each other.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.320]   We can't allow each other to sleep.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.000]   As soon as you see your brother or sister
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.800]   sleeping next to you, you slap them.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.880]   Oh, sorry, not like in the sermon-like style,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.840]   but like, you know what I mean?
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.400]   Spiritual sleepiness.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.900]   If you see your spiritual sleepy brother or sister,
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.640]   you see them on Sundays, you're like, "Hey!"
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.040]   They kind of seem like everything's okay,
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.360]   but you're like, "Oh, they haven't been coming out
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.320]   "till like the weekday things.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.000]   "I wonder what's going on."
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.120]   And you go, and you prod.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.940]   Ephesians 5:15, it says,
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.180]   "Therefore, be careful how you walk,
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.760]   "not as unwise men, but as wise,
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.900]   "making the most of your time."
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.360]   I love that, there it is.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.600]   That's beneficial, right?
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.020]   "Making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.120]   "So then, do not be foolish,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.440]   "but understand what the will of the Lord is,
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.080]   "and do not get drunk with wine."
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.280]   And this is just general principle.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.300]   Don't be drunk on the things of this world.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.020]   "For that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit."
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.880]   Not drunk with the Spirit, but be filled with the Spirit.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.440]   Verse 19, "Speaking to one another."
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.000]   Here it is, we do this together.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.360]   We speak to one another.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:19.680]   Oh, man, I'm forgetting what that's called,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.520]   all of a sudden.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.640]   Verse 19, "Speaking," the I-N-G verb, right?
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.620]   "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.200]   "and spiritual songs shows you the means
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.580]   "as to how this comes out.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.040]   "Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.920]   "Always giving thanks for all things
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.280]   "in the name of our Lord."
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.320]   I love how he changes it.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.080]   "Of our Lord, Jesus Christ, the God, even the Father,
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.280]   "and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   See, cultural influence is real and strong,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.480]   and so if we lose soberness,
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.520]   anything that's generally harmless
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.000]   can begin to creep into our church.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.840]   We've gotta be very careful about these things,
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.360]   because they're not sinful things,
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.200]   and that makes it more dangerous,
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.720]   because the enemy is very clever in these things.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.160]   Our goal is God's glory,
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.240]   and our goal takes into consideration all spiritual truths.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.540]   The dying world, the prowling enemy,
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.040]   the weakness of my flesh,
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.240]   and who I truly am and what I really live for
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.000]   and who I truly love.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.800]   These things are all stuff that we need to think through.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.000]   We need to not just go along with the program,
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.760]   like new movie comes out, oh, we're supposed to watch it.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.720]   New device, oh, we're supposed to purchase it.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.520]   New car, you know, like, oh, well, yeah, anyway.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.760]   I was gonna go into that, but I'm not.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.920]   If someone goes on vacation, we all go there.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.880]   Sometimes we feel that way.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.160]   Why is everyone in Hawaii right now?
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.120]   Well, I guess I better plan that for two years or whatever.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.680]   None of this is wrong, but we need to stay sober together,
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   because those things become very distracting,
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.560]   and ultimately, it's not just distracting,
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   it causes in us rebellious hearts.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.440]   The best way to do this, don't judge one another.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.120]   Don't look at Instagram, be like,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.600]   oh, what the, you spend your money on those things?
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.720]   You spiritually insober person, don't do that.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.560]   But as a church, we walk together,
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.920]   and we really say our mindset is the same.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.720]   Can I end this off here in 1 Peter 4, verse seven,
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.640]   before we pray?
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:25.960]   And I don't know about you, but for me,
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   it's been very clear that even here in our church,
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.760]   there's been a lot going on the last few months,
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.840]   and there's a lot to pray for.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.760]   And, you know, this passage here,
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.080]   Pastor Peter brought it out once
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.440]   during a Friday night praise and prayer.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   Let me read it for us, and then let's talk about it first,
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.280]   just a second.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.680]   The end of all things is near, chapter four, verse seven.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.360]   1 Peter 4, verse seven, I'm not gonna have it up here,
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.840]   so you're gonna need to turn there.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.080]   The end of all things is near.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.840]   Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.120]   for the purpose of prayer.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.920]   So a lot of times we pray for soberness, right?
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.760]   But here what it says, it flips it upside down,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.320]   and it says you need to be sober in order to pray.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:13.440]   So we need to be sober, and when we're sober,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.320]   you know what happens?
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.840]   Just, you can't help but pray.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.880]   You guys have been feeling things, right?
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.840]   Like, you guys have been hearing and seeing,
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.560]   and you know there's been a lot of crazy things happening
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.200]   to a lot of people at our church.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:32.240]   And I hope what happens is soberness is happening.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.600]   And what did it cause you to do personally?
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.280]   Didn't it cause you to pray?
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:41.080]   And I'm so thankful sometimes when trials hit,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.040]   because it causes us to remember that that's reality,
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.240]   and it causes us to spark us out of our sleepiness.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   Now, I'm gonna shortly close us in prayer,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.640]   but I'd like us to all pray,
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.360]   and we're gonna spend a slightly extended time
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.600]   in prayer today.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.900]   And one of the things, as you might have heard,
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:09.960]   Stanley and Christina Sue, they lost their baby
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.520]   that's just a few months old, died very tragically,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.920]   unexpectedly, we're not sure the reason why.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.120]   And it's been very shocking,
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.400]   and even personally for me when I heard the news,
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.040]   you know, their child was about the age of my youngest,
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.640]   and they need our prayers.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:36.560]   And I know that they're really fighting and struggling,
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   and they're really looking to see,
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.160]   to look soberly at the situation.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.040]   But I wanna ask us as a church to pray for them.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.160]   Her name was Kaylee, just a few months old, again.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.520]   And pray for Stanley, and pray for Christina.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.320]   And on top of that, though,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.280]   there's a lot of different health conditions.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.240]   We have people who are struggling with different things.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.920]   You know, you all know.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.760]   In your own lives, you know right now,
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.440]   there might be people who have contracted cancer,
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:14.280]   or who lost a loved one.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.400]   There are people who have recently had
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.920]   people close to them commit suicide.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.280]   There's so many things.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.520]   Would you take a moment today,
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:27.680]   as you look and cast this wide vision
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.960]   upon your life right now,
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.440]   and try to be sober in your view
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.240]   of everything that's going on?
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.960]   And the fact that right now it's Christmas time,
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.040]   where it's all about the holiday drinks,
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.240]   lights, the carols, we love Christmas music.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.240]   And honestly, it causes in a lot of us drunkenness.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.920]   And would you and us all together
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.840]   kinda sober up today, and let's look at our lives,
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.880]   and can we spend an extended amount of time
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.200]   praying together, praying on behalf
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.240]   of some of these families,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.000]   and praying on behalf of our family in Christ here?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.920]   And so let me close with some prayer.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.200]   Afterwards, I'm gonna walk down,
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.160]   and that's gonna be your cue to go ahead
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.520]   and pray on your own.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.640]   And then we'll move on after that.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.480]   Let's pray.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   Heavenly Father,
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.440]   thank you so much
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:28.880]   that in high places and low places,
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.360]   that when things feel so wrong,
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.880]   and things feel like everything's going right,
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.280]   that when it's easy to be happy and joyful,
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.380]   and when it's hard to be happy and joyful,
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.340]   Father, we are called to the same call of sobriety.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.900]   God, that both of those places,
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.540]   if we are not content and satisfied in Christ alone,
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.360]   God, we will lose our heads, we will lose our hearts.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.280]   And so God, I pray that for Berean Community Church,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.320]   in the midst of a season
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.920]   that's supposed to be all about Christ,
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.700]   help us not to be a people who just say it verbally.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.720]   But God, that it's all about Christ for us
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.040]   every minute of every day.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.600]   Whether by life or by death,
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.980]   Christ is exalted, and that we rejoice.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.720]   We pray, God, for our families
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.320]   who are struggling with things.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.960]   God, we pray for the Siouxs.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.940]   God, let them be able to say that.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.700]   Whether by life or by death, Christ is exalted.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.880]   Help them to trust in you.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.360]   Help them to believe in the God they've come to know.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:50.980]   The regular truths that we say you are good
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.840]   and you are sovereign and you do all things
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.580]   for the good of those who love you.
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.640]   I pray, Lord, that it be girded now,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.120]   and that you teach them to trust in you
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.280]   with all their hearts,
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.780]   and they would not lean on their own understanding.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.500]   Help them, God, to acknowledge you.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.580]   Would you give them your peace
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:13.800]   as they lift up to you their petitions and supplications,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.040]   and fill them with an eternal gratitude.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.100]   And I pray, God, for our church,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.320]   that we too would come alongside families like this.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.420]   We know there's a lot going on.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.180]   And I pray, Father, that we would be sober people
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.080]   who would be able to spiritually appraise
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.100]   and evaluate our own lives
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.880]   as well as everything that's going on around.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.460]   That our perspective is eternal,
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.100]   and so the things we partake in,
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.940]   the things we invest in are always eternal.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.380]   And Father, help us not to just do it
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.320]   in the places that are easy for us to surrender,
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.420]   but God, help us to give up our entire lives again.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.940]   Help us remember, Lord, that yes,
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.180]   this is a call that was from the past,
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.540]   but Lord, even today, would you anew that conviction,
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.420]   and help us, Lord, to respond,
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.960]   and not just agree with the concept of surrender,
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.400]   but that we would submit now to you
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.140]   and bow the knee before our Lord and our King.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.580]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.000]   (blows kiss)
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.420]   (blows kiss)
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.840]   (blows kiss)
