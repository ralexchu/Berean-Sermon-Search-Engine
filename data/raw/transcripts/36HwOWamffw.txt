[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.580]   Good morning, church family.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.420]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   Hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.120]   As we gather this morning together for worship,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.620]   as we come to sing, to hear his word, to remember the gospel,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.420]   I pray that we would come humbly before our God,
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.300]   for it is he who gives us life, it is he who sustains us,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.460]   and it is he who meets our every need.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.420]   So as we begin, let us sing the song,
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.620]   "Lord, I Need You" together.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.120]   [MUSIC - "LORD, I NEED YOU"]
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:17:04.620]   (SINGING) Lord, I come, I confess.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:11.120]   Bound in here, I find my rest.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.620]   Without you, I fall apart.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.620]   You're the one that guides my heart.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.620]   Lord, I need you.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   Oh, I need you.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.620]   Every hour, I need you.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:47.120]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.120]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   Sin runs deep.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   Your grace is more.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.620]   Your grace is found.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.620]   It's where you are.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:15.120]   And where you are, Lord, I am free.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.120]   Holiness is Christ in me.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   Lord, I need you.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   Oh, I need you.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.120]   Every hour, I need you.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.620]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.120]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   So teach my soul to rise to you when temptation comes my way.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   When I cannot stand, I'll fall on you.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.620]   Jesus, you're my hope and stay.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.120]   Lord, I need you.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.620]   Lord, I need you.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.120]   Oh, I need you.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   Every hour, I need you.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.620]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.120]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   Lord, I need you.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   Oh, I need you.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.620]   Every hour, I need you.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:16.120]   My one defense, my righteousness.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.620]   Oh, God, how I need you.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:28.120]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.620]   All right.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.120]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.880]   I want to welcome everyone to this morning's service.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.520]   If you are new to the church, I want
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.240]   to extend a warm welcome to you and ask that after the service,
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.420]   please visit us at the Welcome Booth.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.220]   It's the canopy that you saw in the parking lot.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.320]   And you'll also see our welcome team members
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.520]   there at the blue lanyards.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.520]   If you have questions about Berean, et cetera,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.620]   we'd be happy to answer any of those things for you.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.620]   I want to highlight that in November 27 at 1 PM,
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.540]   there is the Season Jubilee Fellowship.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.220]   Elder Philip announced that last week.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.200]   It's going to be called Jubilee Moving Forward.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.100]   Please be sure to sign up so they can get a head count.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.940]   If you have any questions, reach out to Elder Philip.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.180]   Also, I want to make note that on December 4,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.200]   we are going to be having another communion service.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.580]   And at that time, we're going to be doing it in such a way
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.700]   where we're going to set up tables here.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.320]   And when you're ready, you can come up.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.480]   And we'll give instructions.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.140]   But look out for an email for that,
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.940]   as we're going to give a diagram on how we can facilitate that
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.340]   the best way.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.340]   Also, as we're approaching the holidays,
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.900]   we have a special announcement for some opportunities
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.260]   that you can get involved with.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.220]   Let's welcome up Evangeline.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.180]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.200]   Good morning, church family.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.320]   My name is Evangeline, in case you haven't met me.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.460]   Merry Christmas, since holiday is coming up soon.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.080]   Here are just some announcements for how
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.460]   you can get involved in the holiday outreach this year.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.880]   It's kind of long, so I'll try to keep it as quick as possible.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.240]   The first is going to be through the OC Rescue Mission.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.400]   You can see some of the information here on the slide
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.320]   as well.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.840]   This is a Christian organization,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   which is located in Tustin, whose mission is to just share
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   the love of Christ to the homeless community
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.600]   through counseling, job training, shelter,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.760]   and just so much more.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.040]   One way that you can serve is through their soup kitchen,
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.760]   where you can help serve the food
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.720]   and interact with the residents.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.920]   Or if you can't make it, you can sponsor a meal for them,
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.240]   where you just donate money to pay for their meal that day.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.560]   Or if you're feeling ambitious, you can do both.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.920]   So this event will be held on Friday, December 2,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.480]   from 4 to 6, 30 PM.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.600]   So mark your calendars, because the date is coming up soon.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.960]   And if you have any questions, you
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.760]   can reach out to Nicole Chun.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.640]   And there's a booth outside as well.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.880]   The next opportunity is going to be at Brookdale Assisted Living
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.440]   Facility in Anaheim.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   This is where elderly residents reside.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.160]   And there are two opportunities where you can serve here.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.560]   The first is through Christmas caroling.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.080]   And this is open to everyone, including children.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.200]   And we know that old people love kids, so bring your kids.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.000]   And then let's see.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.560]   So you'll be able to sing with them, share the gospel,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.720]   do crafts, and just interact with the residents as well.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.200]   This opportunity will be held on Saturday, December 17,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.000]   from 10 AM to 12 PM.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.480]   The second opportunity is going to be through cardmaking,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.240]   where you can make a Christmas card either by yourself
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.080]   or with your kids.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.400]   And it will be delivered to the residents the same day
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.320]   as the caroling day.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.920]   You have the option to either come to church with your family
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.440]   and you can make a card on December 11
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.480]   or after second service, which will be between 1 to 3 PM
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.080]   in the old cafe.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.600]   Supplies are also provided.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.040]   Or you can just make a card at home
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.360]   and then bring it by that same date, December 11.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.640]   OK, so there's a lot of information for that one.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.840]   So you can find Sharon's saying for any questions.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.040]   For both of the events that I just mentioned,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.680]   the last day to sign up is going to be the Sunday before each
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.400]   event.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.760]   So for example, the OC Rescue Mission event
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.400]   is going to be on Friday, December 2.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.600]   So the last day to sign up will be Sunday, November 27.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.360]   And then same thing for the caroling
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   and as well as for the card making.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.960]   And then last but not least is through Living Well Pregnancy
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.720]   Center.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.480]   Living Well is a Christian organization
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.640]   that provides free pregnancy services for women
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.200]   who are at the crossroads of an unplanned pregnancy
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.360]   in the Orange County area.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.040]   They provide many free services, such as pregnancy tests,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.200]   ultrasounds, support and counseling, baby supplies,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.720]   and just a lot more other services as well.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.280]   And most importantly, they just focus
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.800]   on preserving the life of the unborn baby
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.260]   as well as supporting the moms who
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.800]   may be going through a difficult time as well.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.200]   So the church will be hosting a baby bottle drive.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.440]   So this is where we will distribute these baby
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.480]   bottles or piggy banks.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.720]   You might have seen them outside at the booth.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.440]   But what you can do is just fill it with loose change, cash,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.200]   checks of any amount.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.640]   And then we'll donate that to the pregnancy center.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   The last day we will collect all the bottles
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.840]   will be December 11, which is the same day as the card making
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.320]   day.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.880]   So you can just bring it if you have it next week or whenever.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.520]   OK, let's see.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.640]   So this is also--
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.800]   I think it's very important, just kind
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.120]   of in light of the election and everything that went on,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.940]   this is a tangible way that we can get involved.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.720]   And this is also my booth.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.440]   So please take all the bottles and clean me out
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.320]   by the end of service.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.680]   That would be great so I have less to carry.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.560]   So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.000]   Again, all of this is going to be on either the brain app.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   So I know there's a lot of deadlines and dates.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.280]   So you can find it there or after service.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.720]   You can just find us at our booth.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.000]   We can give you more information on that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.400]   Ultimately, our biggest desire for this holiday outreach
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.520]   is that God will just use us as vessels
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.400]   and that he will be glorified in all of this.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.680]   So we just ask that you would be prayerful over these ministries
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.920]   and get involved if you can.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   Thank you.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.160]   Yeah, we are very thankful to our sisters ministry,
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.480]   for putting together these opportunities.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.880]   Again, please do check out the app for further information
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   for sign up or visit the tables outside.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.360]   At this time, let's move into a moment of prayer
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.400]   for our offering.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.320]   If you do have a physical check, there's
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.480]   a offering box there by the entrance,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.360]   or you can give it on the online platform.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.800]   Let's pray together.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.640]   Lord, we gather together to give you thanks.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.160]   God, we gather together to give you our worship and adoration.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.920]   Lord, we want to acknowledge that you deserve it all.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.240]   And Lord, the more that we come to you, we receive from you
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.440]   and recognize that you grant to us so much,
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.360]   from your instruction to your comfort,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.640]   to your mercies new every day.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.800]   So we want to lift up our heart of gratitude to you.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.260]   And we pray for the offering, Lord,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.480]   that it would be an expression, Lord, of our thankfulness.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.280]   And God, that you would continue just to use everything
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.640]   from the offering to our time, our worship,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.480]   this church for the furthering of your kingdom.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.200]   We thank you, God.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.280]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:06.780]   Amen.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:48.520]   You, oh Lord.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   You, oh Lord, have made a way.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:01.000]   The great divine, you hear.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   For when our hearts were far away,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.480]   your love went further still.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.960]   Yes, your love.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.440]   Yes, your love goes further still.

[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.680]   You may be seated.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:17.600]   Good morning again, everyone.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.240]   Please turn your Bible to Joshua chapter 1.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.040]   And we'll be reading from Joshua 1, 1 through 9.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:33.440]   It's a familiar, very familiar passage for a lot of people.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:40.720]   And it has very, I guess you can say, broad and familiar teaching points.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:48.280]   Everything from the idea of trusting God, being strong in the Lord,
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   obeying as you go, and entering into the promises of the Lord.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   And so these are themes that we learn and repeat multiple times.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.280]   But I felt the need for me personally to review.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.080]   I'm doing my devotion in it and found that there were so many details that
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.120]   perhaps I thought I knew, and just the question of do I really even
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.640]   understand what it means to be strong.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.960]   So with that said, let's take a moment to read Joshua 1, 1 through 9.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.520]   And it says, "Now it came about after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.280]   that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.160]   'Moses, my servant is dead.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.120]   Now, therefore, arise.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   Cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them,
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.440]   to the sons of Israel.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.000]   Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   just as I spoke to Moses.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.080]   From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as this great river,
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.920]   the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the great sea
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.960]   towards the setting of the sun, will be your territory.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.280]   No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.840]   Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.400]   I will not fail you or forsake you.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.000]   Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people possession of the land
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.520]   which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.840]   Only be strong and very courageous.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.280]   Be careful to do according to all the law which Moses, my servant, commanded you.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.680]   wherever you go.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.520]   This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.000]   on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that it is
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   written in it.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.040]   For then, you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.720]   Have I not commanded you?
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.400]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.480]   Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.080]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:01.560]   God, we want to ask for your grace and blessing.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:08.040]   God, we need the ministry of your spirit to help us understand, not just
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.880]   conceptually, but to help us have deep conviction, to understand in such a way
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.440]   where we can apply and also be the kind of strong and courageous followers,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.200]   children, Lord, that have your power and your strength abiding in us.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.560]   So, this we pray in Christ's name.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.360]   Amen.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.560]   Okay.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.400]   Apologies for me one second here.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:39.000]   Switch.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.960]   Okay.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.840]   So, as we take a look at this passage, we needed to set up a little background
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.520]   story, right?
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.520]   As we look at Old Testament passages, we want to make sure we're jumping into
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.000]   context and the story the right way.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.080]   This obviously is a familiar story where it's a story of conquest.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.160]   It's a story where the biggest portion of the book of Joshua is them entering
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.360]   into Jericho, then from there, basically having conquest over the land
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:13.320]   of the Canaanites, and then the rest of the book is just making sure every tribe
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.520]   got a piece of the land and how God divided it for the nation, okay?
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.680]   So, a lot of times when you look at the book of Joshua, people see it as a
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.440]   victorious book.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.520]   And if you sometimes go on YouTube, which I do, I sometimes write my sermons and
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.960]   then I go on YouTube to see, "Oh, I wonder what people are saying about it."
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.960]   A lot of it happens to be the, "You can do it.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.920]   The Lord is with you in your endeavors, in your business, in your school,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.840]   in your family, in your job, whatever it may be, you can do it.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.560]   Let's go."
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.600]   And it's a motivational book.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.440]   And in many ways, it is because they are on the biggest enterprise ever in their
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.120]   history of their nation.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.520]   They're seeing the fulfillment of God's promises that has been from ages ago.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.120]   So, this is a book of victories.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.840]   But not so much, okay?
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.360]   The reason why I say this is because obviously God felt the need, okay,
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.600]   if I can put it that way.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.440]   God is giving Joshua encouragement.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.760]   "You need to be strong."
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.880]   And it begs the question, why is he so emphatically three times over saying,
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.520]   "You have to be strong.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.320]   You have to be courageous."
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:38.360]   And it's because leading up to this point has been anything but that, okay?
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.040]   There has been so much fear in the journey of the Israelites.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.800]   Leaving Egypt alone was, "I don't know if I can talk to Pharaoh.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.120]   Oh, my goodness, they're going to oppress us more.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.040]   We're going to die along the way.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.480]   We'll die at the river.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.800]   We'll die at the sea.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.240]   We'll die in the desert.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.920]   Die, die, die."
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.920]   That was the fear that was filling their hearts.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   And then when they actually got past all that, and as you know, Joshua,
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.800]   he left Egypt with Moses.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.960]   Commentators say that they believe he was a slave there too, and he was a young man,
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.680]   and he served as a servant of Moses all the way through.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.040]   So he was with Moses the whole time.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.240]   They come to the Promised Land once before, right?
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.520]   And at that time, there were 12 men sent as scouts.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.480]   When you go and take a look at the land, what do we have there?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   They actually come back with hordes of fruit.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.880]   The land is a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.720]   But what was filling their hearts?
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   Fear.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.920]   They're too big, city too fortified.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.600]   We can't do this.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:52.440]   And that was the sentiment of the entire group, that cohort of scouts,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.080]   and it swayed everybody.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.480]   And the story goes in numbers, right?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.640]   Numbers 13, "Oh, my goodness, should we have just died in the land of Egypt?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.400]   You bring us out here, Moses, just to die?"
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.280]   It was fear.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.920]   And the ramifications of that fear was God had them wander the desert for 40 years.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.840]   They were right there.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.880]   Okay.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:24.000]   To set the stage for you then, they are coming to this point riddled with failure,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.960]   riddled with doubt, tons of fear, and now they're just older.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.840]   Okay.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.440]   Before, maybe they were younger, you know, 30, 40-year-olds,
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.080]   but now they're like 60, 80-year-olds.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:44.320]   And the many people who were militiamen of that time, unfortunately, they have died.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.080]   That generation of people who came out of Egypt and saw the wonders of God,
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.760]   the pillars of fire, the smoke, all that stuff,
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.600]   they walked through the wilderness and experienced,
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.760]   but a lot of the older generation, they passed along the way.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.880]   So is this really a situation where it's, "Let's go, we can do it.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.600]   I'm so confident in all of you."
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.200]   This is not.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.640]   It's not that kind of scenario.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.280]   Actually, it's a dire scenario.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.680]   Can we go in and actually take this fortified city?
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.320]   They're still strong.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.040]   They're still bigger than us.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:21.720]   Look at us.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.560]   We've actually spent the entire time just eating manna.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.360]   Actually, the situation looks bleak.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:34.160]   And in that situation, God says, "Joshua, you are now going to be the man.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.640]   You're the leader, my servant that will take my people into the promised land.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.200]   And you need to be strong."
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.560]   Okay.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.440]   I hope that helped you kind of place the scenario, and then you would have to do
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.600]   the, "If I was Joshua, what does it mean to be strong?
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.240]   Are you going to become maybe in the figment of our imagination kind of like
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.080]   the Braveheart man?
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.800]   He's riding on a horse, pace-painted.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.720]   He's just galloping up and down the army, telling them, "Don't ever take us."
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.600]   He's pounding his chest, screaming, "Freedom."
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.240]   And he's going to become the greatest motivational speaker that ever was.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.080]   Is that what strength means?
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.160]   And I think, again, we have to understand what does God command us really when He
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.120]   wants us to be strong?
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.720]   And I want to hit these points with you.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.880]   And I want to, again, remind us that these points are not points that you've
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.280]   never heard before.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:36.000]   These are age-old truths that we have to learn over and over again and understand.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.720]   First, one of the things that God does in this passage in Joshua 1 is actually
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.000]   before He is telling Joshua, "You need to be strong," there is a scenario where all
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.320]   of the confidences and strengths of the humankind are being removed.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.360]   So, point number one to you, God will purposely, not in every single instance,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.080]   but at key moments in time, He has clearly, purposely removed your
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.880]   human strength.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.240]   He has removed the human confidence within this scenario.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.480]   And let me show you by reading this beginning portion of our text again.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.400]   In chapter 1, verses 1 through 2, it says, "Now it came about after the death
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.080]   of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Joshua,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.800]   the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying, 'Moses, my servant, is dead.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.080]   Now, therefore, arise.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.560]   Cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them,
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.120]   to the sons of Israel.'"
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:42.200]   Doesn't it sound like in that passage, God's timing is very purposeful, right?
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.720]   It looks like He intentionally waited for Moses to pass before going
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.600]   into the promised land.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.880]   In our human minds, in the human sense of the strength, it would have only made sense
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.560]   that the main leader, the primary one that God has been talking to,
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.320]   the one who has vigor and sharpness, that He be the one to lead.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.400]   Doesn't make sense that at the pinnacle moment, we've journeyed, we've traveled,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.360]   and now that we're going, that God will purposely cause His death.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.280]   Now, I say this because I want to highlight this interesting passage
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.880]   in Deuteronomy for you.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.000]   Deuteronomy 34, verse 7 through 12.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   There it is on the screen, but I recommend you flip back and forth.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.200]   We're going to be looking at a lot of passages today, just as a heads up to you,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.360]   in Deuteronomy and Joshua, okay?
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:40.440]   Deuteronomy 34 says, "Although Moses was 120 years old," he was an old man,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.800]   "his eyes were not dim, nor his vigor abated."
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.520]   His eyes were sharp, you guys.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.040]   He was still strong, okay?
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.600]   And that being the case, if I was a man looking at him, I would be thinking,
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.480]   "You're like that God with the glory, the white hair.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.640]   Lead us.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   You're still strong.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.480]   We can do this."
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.800]   But instead, God commanded him to go up to the mountain to pass.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.400]   And so, reading this, it says, "So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.440]   plains of Moab 30 days.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.880]   Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.960]   And now Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom,
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.080]   for Moses had laid his hand on him.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.440]   And the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.200]   Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.640]   whom the Lord knew face to face.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.480]   For all the signs and the wonders which the Lord had sent to him to perform in the
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.280]   land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants and all his land,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.600]   and all the mighty power, and for all the great terror which Moses
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.680]   performed in the sight of all Israel."
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.720]   All that's to say is Moses was the man.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   He performed all these miracles, produced terror in the land.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.120]   He was the one that people actually saw as the prophet so much so neighboring
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.520]   nations would see him as a mini-God.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.560]   And you're telling me that as we go in, not to a skirmish, but to war,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.920]   to put a ban on other nations and to destroy them utterly,
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.800]   you're going to take the guy?
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.840]   Doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:25.160]   Well, it makes sense if God intentionally is stripping away the kind of human
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.800]   confidence we typically want.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:32.160]   Don't you know that in the history of the Israelites, one of their greatest faults
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.080]   was that they always wanted a human leader like the rest?
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.920]   They always wanted a prophet, "You be our prophet.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.600]   You speak for us."
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.520]   They always wanted a king, "You be our king."
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.120]   And so a lot of what got them into trouble was thinking, presuming,
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.640]   "Of course, if we had a man this tall, we had a man with this much army,
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.920]   we had a man with this many horses.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.520]   Of course, we'd be strong."
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.040]   And God says, "Nope."
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:49:59.840]   You know what else?
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.240]   God removes human confidence because the people themselves,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.600]   the Israelite nation, they were, they are, and they will be a failure
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.920]   in this story.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.360]   That sounds mean and like an unfair judgment, but think about the fact that
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.400]   when they were here multiple times, and it wasn't just once,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.120]   it wasn't just that time with Joshua and Caleb where they said, "Oh,
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.200]   these people of Jericho, the people of the land of Canaan,
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.000]   they're so big and they're so strong.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.320]   We can't do it."
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.160]   It was multiple times.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.480]   When they wandered, they actually wandered towards the south end of Canaan,
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.080]   they failed.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.640]   They came to the north side of Canaan, they failed.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.160]   In the past, they've already said so many times with their own human wisdom,
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.320]   "We can't do this."
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:52.520]   But what's more, before Moses passes, God tells them this incredible
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.320]   forewarning.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:59.160]   Take your Bibles and go to Deuteronomy 31, verse 14 through 18.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.360]   Deuteronomy 31, 14 through 18.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:08.840]   Recall that Deuteronomy is God's rallying of the people through Moses saying,
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.720]   "When we enter this land," they're on the plain of Moab looking at the land and
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.880]   saying, "When we enter, you guys, you better obey.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.560]   You need to listen to me."
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.640]   Right?
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.960]   But then look what he says.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.440]   "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, the time for you to die is near.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:31.480]   Call Joshua, present yourself at the tent of meeting that I may commission him.'
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.600]   So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting."
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.640]   So here they are together.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   "And the Lord appeared in the tent, in a pillar of cloud.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.840]   The pillar of cloud stood at the doorway."
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.040]   That's one magnificent scene.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   And then he said, "Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers,
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.440]   and yet this people will rise, they'll play the harlot with strange
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.080]   gods of the land."
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.120]   What?
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.800]   And then it says, "This land in the midst of which you are going,
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.520]   and they will forsake me, break my covenant which I have made with them,
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.680]   and then my anger will be kindled against them in the day.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.480]   I will forsake them and hide my face from them, and they will be consumed.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.760]   Many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day,
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:28.680]   'Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come upon us?'"
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.800]   Mind-blowing.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.280]   I don't know the mind of God.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.920]   I can't counsel His way.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.720]   But in the moment when He is regathering the people and saying,
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.600]   "You're about to enter the land," and Moses is like, "Yes,
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.160]   there's curses for disobedience and blessings for obedience.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.560]   We better go in with victory."
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:56.160]   And God says, "But they're going to play the harlot, and my hand is on them."
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:02.000]   You talk about the most deflating thing you can say at a rally event is to say,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.320]   "And all of you will betray me."
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.240]   What?
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.680]   If they had any confidence like, "Yeah, now that we have fresh blood,
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.640]   now that we're younger, and now that maybe we learned some things,"
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.520]   God just wipes that clean, doesn't He?
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.720]   He says, "No.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.320]   And you're going to understand the reason why you're suffering is because you're
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.160]   far from me.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.520]   With me, success.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.720]   Away from me, failure.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.400]   With your own power, you could have everything.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.360]   You could have multiple kings if you want to.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.400]   Failure."
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   And that is a lesson to learn.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.160]   You guys remember the story of Gideon and his army, right?
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:47.080]   Gideon, he is one of the judges, and he comes out in the hall of faith,
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.000]   but no one necessarily see him as, "Oh, I want to be that guy."
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.800]   The guy who was so timid, he said, "God, can you make sure we win?
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.720]   And just so that I know that we win, can you make this fleece wet?
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.600]   Can you make it dry and then wet again?"
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.480]   And then he just constantly tried to test the Lord.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.000]   But one of the craziest things about his excursion and his military fight that he
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   was about to get into was he tried to rally everybody, and he rallied 32,000
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.600]   soldiers.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:25.840]   Now, unfortunately, that wasn't enough for all these other kingdoms that they had
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.240]   to go against.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.360]   That was just a blimp compared to the hundreds of thousands that other nations
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.240]   had.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.560]   And so Gideon was fearful.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.920]   His heart was in need of courage.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.720]   And do you know what God did?
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   He gave Gideon horses.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.560]   And no, he didn't.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.760]   He didn't give them chariots.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.600]   He didn't give them anything.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.040]   You know what he said?
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   He said, "You know, if you're afraid," like this is literally the kind of
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.440]   verbiage God used, "If you're afraid, let everyone who's afraid just go home."
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.240]   That's strange, isn't it?
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.160]   Do you know how many people of the 32,000 went home?
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.200]   Twenty-two thousand of them.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.960]   Ten thousand were left, and God said, "That's too much for me to just give the
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.800]   Midianites to you.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.320]   Send them rest home."
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.040]   They were left with 300.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.800]   And with that, God said, "I am doing this purposely."
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.120]   Let me read to you what he says.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.880]   Judges 7, verse 2 through 3.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.360]   Judges 7, verse 2 through 3.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.960]   "The Lord said to Gideon, 'The people who are with you are too many for me to give
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.000]   the Midianites into your hands.'
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.720]   For Israel would become boastful, saying, 'My own power has delivered me.'"
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.680]   Whoa.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:44.920]   God, I said earlier, may at certain times strip you of your confidence.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.080]   And many of you have already experienced it.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.440]   You have tested the waters.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:58.040]   And the thing about it is we are already taught that for salvation, all God, that's the
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.720]   gospel, right?
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.640]   For salvation, entirely everything God.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.360]   There is nothing I can do to add.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   But on the flip side, I want to ask you this question.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:17.320]   Subtly have you been duped to think, "But everything else, my finances, my relationships,
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:24.600]   my well-being, my security, my success in this life, it's my education, my people,
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.200]   my know-how, and my wisdom."
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.600]   You see what I'm asking, right?
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:37.560]   Have you made that weird distinction where we think that the peripheral things, the on-this-life
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:44.520]   things, the human, earthly things that I need to care of is on me, and therefore I need,
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.880]   I need more education to make sure this, I need more that, and I need more this?
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.040]   Well, let me say to you, God says, "No, I make rich and I make poor."
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.080]   God is sovereign over that.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.980]   When you're alone, God is sovereign over the relationships you have.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.000]   God is also the one who blesses you with community.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.900]   God has sovereignty over every element of your life, including the elements we think
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.640]   are just the practical things of this life.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.040]   That's what He says, right?
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.120]   And I want to remind you of that.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:21.160]   And therefore, sometimes if we ourselves as the children of God, as He is our Father,
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:25.500]   we start thinking, "You know, I have accumulated enough.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.080]   I want to challenge you with this."
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:34.520]   Think about your life currently with all of those facets, right, of your finances, people,
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.340]   and the different things that really matter, right?
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:42.720]   And then ask yourself, "If I remove God from my life, does it make any difference?"
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.480]   And that means we have been working hard to secure an environment where we don't need
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   God.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.600]   Now, in wisdom, you have to pursue all of these things, your finances, your relationships.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.480]   In wisdom, you have to make sure you're guarding your family, yourself, all that stuff.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.600]   Good.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   But at certain moments, God will teach us, "Within all of that, I'm sovereign."
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.720]   And there should be no confidence that you alone are going to secure for yourself even
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   a dollar.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.320]   That's the point.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.280]   They are supposed to walk into a nation and it's simply, it can be just a calculation.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   It makes sense.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.960]   Do we have more men than they do?
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   Do we have more chariots, more weapons, more manpower?
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   Totally makes sense to me.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   Let's go.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.920]   And God says, "No, you won't have no leader.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.480]   Your people are going to be a failure and there's going to be no confidence in the flesh
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:40.560]   because this success is going to be entirely on my fulfillment of my promise of my grace."
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.360]   That's the lesson we have to learn.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.360]   Amen.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.240]   So from that, we know we don't have confidence in the flesh.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.720]   We don't have confidence in our power, but we have to have confidence in His promise
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.040]   and provision.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.680]   Number two, there is one thing to know.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.880]   I know God provides.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.000]   I know God gives.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.880]   There's another thing to be strong in it, to take risk and base your life on it.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.220]   You don't see it with your eyes.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.840]   It's not there right now.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:14.800]   But His promises and His provision, you believe to such a degree where you are strong in it.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.160]   Let's take a look at this passage again.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:24.220]   And notice in verse 3, He talks about how God is the one who has given it to you, okay?
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:29.280]   And then starting from verse 5, He says, "No man will be able to stand before you all the
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.800]   days of your life."
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:36.600]   And then look at this, "Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.040]   I will not fail you or forsake you.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.520]   Be strong and courageous."
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.920]   Verse 9, "Have I not commanded you therefore?
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.660]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:53.600]   Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.400]   Amen.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:04.000]   The promise of God in this verse specifically is that just as God was speaking to Moses,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.400]   just as God was in a relationship close, near, and intimately involved in the decisions,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.040]   the worries of Moses, God says, "I will be with you.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   I will not fail you."
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.120]   And this is the promise God has given all the saints of old.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.480]   This is the promise God has given to the early fathers, the patriarchs, to Abraham, Isaac,
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.640]   Jacob, and more.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.800]   He said, "I will be with you, and I will be the one to bless you."
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   And it therefore makes us think, "Man, that's kind of crazy."
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.400]   It makes us think about the fact that if I truly believe God's presence is with me, that
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.800]   should make me incredibly powerful.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.920]   And yet there are moments when I don't feel that power.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:58.400]   And to me, it's like having a billionaire then going to Costco and wondering, "Do you
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.080]   think I could afford that hot dog?"
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.840]   It would be like going into war with a billion soldiers and wondering, "Do you think we
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.160]   could take this little island?"
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.200]   Now, I want us to take that analogy and just think for a moment.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.000]   God is impressing on Joshua, "I will be with you."
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.600]   But if we keep asking this question, "But Dad, can we really afford this hot dog?"
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.120]   At some points, it gets really offensive, doesn't it?
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.680]   Why would you sit there and ask, you're going with your father to the Costco, why would
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.440]   you sit there and ask, "But what are we going to do about the hot dog?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.080]   When we get to the register, what are we going to do?"
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.600]   But the thing about it is that sometimes is the state of affairs of our heart.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.480]   "God, what's going to happen in my next five-year plan?
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.640]   What's going to happen in my family?
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640]   What's going to happen to my own children?
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   What's going to happen with," and then we have an X, Y, and Z of all of these questions
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   and all of these, I guess you can say even demands.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.520]   "Bless us with this and bless us with that," and God is going to say to you, "I have in
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.480]   my plan a blessing already that I want to give you and I've promised it.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.580]   Don't give me your own plans of your provisions and the things that you think you need.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.360]   Don't demand the provisions of your blessing.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.200]   I've already promised this to you.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.080]   That should produce in us an incredible kind of strength."
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.800]   And so here's a passage from Ephesians chapter 6.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:41.720]   We think about this idea of being strong in God and that strength then has to come from
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:47.880]   something that comes from God's promises, provisions, His might, and more.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.600]   Ephesians tells us, "Be strong in the Lord in the strength of His might, putting on His
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   armor," right?
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600]   This is the full armor of God.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:00.160]   It's the armor of, that says in verse 11, "Put on the full armor of God so that you'll
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.480]   be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.520]   Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against powers, against
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.040]   forces of darkness, and against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.360]   Therefore, put on the full armor of God."
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:23.080]   And then that list goes on to tell us about how there's going to be like the truth, the
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.520]   breastplate of righteousness, the feet of the gospel, the shield of faith, helmet of
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.680]   salvation, and the list goes on.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:39.360]   My only admonition to us is if we allow fear to rest, if we allow fear to dictate and have
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.680]   authority of us, we're basically telling the Lord, "You haven't given us much."
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:52.760]   You see, sometimes I wonder if any of us were in genuine deep, deep pains, and this summer
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.440]   was, there was a lot of tragedy.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.440]   Many individuals in our church family, they've lost loved ones, grandparents, their fathers,
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   mothers, and more.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.080]   This summer, there was a lot of tragedy.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.200]   And all of us would assume if in the midst of that tragedy and pain, someone came and
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   said, "Be strong and courageous," that would be slightly insensitive, yes?
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.800]   And we would say, "Hey, hey, the emotions are real.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.240]   The pain is raw.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.520]   You can't just tell somebody, 'Be strong,' right?"
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.280]   And that's true, you can't.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.440]   However, you can when the God of the universe says, "I have given you all of my presence,
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.160]   all of the truth that you need to know.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.880]   I have given you provision, the Spirit, the community.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.400]   God has given us so much."
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.680]   And so I would encourage the same for you.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.080]   If sometimes you're in a position of counseling somebody, it would be actually incomplete
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.280]   just to say, "You know what?
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.240]   You just need to be strong."
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.680]   What actually needs to happen is to say, "Think about the provisions of God."
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   Amen?
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:09.160]   Now, as we think about that then, this is the way that Moses was thinking.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.560]   This is the way Joshua was thinking.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.680]   The provision of God is, "He's going to fight for me."
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   Amen?
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.480]   The provision of God is, "He's not going to leave me."
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.240]   The provision of God is Romans 8, "What is going to actually separate me from the power
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.600]   and love of my God?
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   Nothing.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.320]   No angel, no demon, no famine, no sword, nothing.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.400]   To my own death, nothing."
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.120]   That's supposed to be powerful.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   Yes?
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.160]   That's supposed to be incredibly powerful.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:47.520]   And so today, if any of you have come in here and you have incredible fears, fears about…and
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.880]   it's not just financial, but recently I've been talking to a lot of people and they are,
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   they're scared.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.760]   They'll say, "I feel like my job is on the chopping block."
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.480]   They'll say, "I'm actually already doing two to three people's jobs because other people
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.960]   have been getting laid off."
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.360]   What are you going to do in that kind of scenario?
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.160]   Are you supposed to say, "Be strengthened.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   Don't worry.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.680]   You already have a good degree and good work experience.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   You'll be fine."
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.640]   Is that the source of your power and strength?
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.440]   No, no, no.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.480]   We're supposed to say, "In the state of joblessness, in the state of hopelessness, in the state
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.320]   of any kind of darkness, God has told me He will never fail me."
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   Amen?
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.600]   That is the kind of strength and conviction we want to have.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.880]   Number three, God says that He wants us to be strong in His commands.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:45.200]   God says that He wants us to have a kind of strength where we have vigor in obedience.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.800]   If you think about a person who's strong, you can think about a lot of different types
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.840]   of strength.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.680]   I could have strength of brute force.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.200]   I could have strength of power to control you.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.040]   I could have strength in the sense of influence, or maybe you're thinking strength as in just
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:05.800]   like this angry, mad, you're just picturing this person who is just violent and he has
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.280]   this kind of crazy strength about him.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:15.600]   But this kind of strength is more like even if you're calm, even if you're collected and
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:23.760]   self-controlled, you have conviction and you say, "No matter what happens, I'm obeying
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760]   God."
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.480]   God sees that as strength.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.440]   Take a look at this passage, what God commands Joshua.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:36.160]   The biggest portion of Joshua chapter 1 is not so much, "Be strong, be strong, be strong,"
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.720]   although that is repeated three times, but undergirding every single one of those be
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.460]   strong is what?
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:47.720]   He says, "Be strong and courageous, for you shall give the people the possession of the
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.560]   land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.240]   But only be strong and courageous, being careful to do according to all the law which Moses
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   my servant commanded you.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.280]   Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280]   you go.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.240]   This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate it day
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.800]   and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.600]   For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.240]   Have I not commanded you?"
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.520]   That's an emphatic rhetorical question.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:30.640]   Have I not given you my instruction and my law, and my goodwill has been given to you
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.420]   by the Scriptures?
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:38.480]   My character, my provision and protection, my instruction has been given to you by the
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.140]   Word of God.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:44.940]   So what is actually popping out from this portion from verses six through nine in Joshua
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   chapter one?
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.860]   Yes, he says, "Be strong, be strong, be strong."
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   And then maybe I'm thinking as a man, it's like, "That's right.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   I'm going to be a man.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:55.860]   And when I speak, you're going to hear me, and you're not going to interrupt.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.460]   And I'm going to be a man because I'm going to lead.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.220]   I'm going to tell you what to do."
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:05.020]   I have had all of those silly thoughts in my head.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:09.420]   But here God says, "Be strong.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.100]   Pay such careful attention."
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.220]   If we're walking through this, look at everything He says.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.900]   He says, "Be careful to do."
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   That means a kind of precision.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:21.740]   Let me ask you, brothers and sisters, when you look at the Scriptures, are you content
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.900]   with, "I got it.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.260]   I got it."
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.140]   Or are you looking at it with precision, with, "What does that mean?
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.580]   How am I supposed to do that?"
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.980]   Are you looking at it for accuracy?
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:37.460]   Are you bent on making sure that you're going to do it to the T?
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.960]   That's different.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.380]   He says to do all of it.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.460]   Brothers and sisters, are you content that you got the general big five?
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:48.020]   It's the stuff like, you know, the big golden rule, "I love people.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.620]   Like, you know, I want to be loved, so I'm a pretty good Christian."
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.900]   And then the other commandments, "I don't know about them."
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.940]   That's not strength, is it?
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:04.540]   To have such a shallow, to have such a limited view of all of God's will is actually ignorance,
[01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.820]   folly, and weakness.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.900]   It's not strength.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:15.300]   What's more, just in the commandments to say, to tell Joshua that he needs to have the Word
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.580]   of God on his mouth?
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.020]   Isn't that weird?
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.180]   We kind of think like you just kind of have to have it up here in your head memorized
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.980]   or you're thinking about it or you heard the sermons, so you're meditating.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.580]   But He says, "No, let it be in your mouth.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.340]   You're ready.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.100]   You're ready to speak it.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.380]   You're ready in that situation where it seems dire to say, 'This is what the Word of God
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.740]   has to say about that situation.'"
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.140]   He wants us to meditate on it all because He wants us to be so careful that there is
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.340]   zero deviance.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.740]   It's all right there.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:48.900]   There is a kind of strength.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.680]   You don't have to have a loud, booming voice.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.980]   You don't have to be machismo.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.940]   You can be a soft 12-year-old girl in this room, but if you're like, "No, I don't want
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:06.220]   to lie because God said so," you're like the strongest person in the room, right?
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:12.300]   If you just stick to your convictions of, "This is the will of God," you are strong,
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.940]   resilient.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:18.340]   And God says, "The weak person is like seaweed in the ocean, just getting swayed left and
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.340]   right."
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.940]   And Satan's scheme is to move you like that, just manipulate you.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.540]   That's enough.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.540]   God says, "Go worship."
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.340]   No, you don't have to make it all the way to Jerusalem.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.180]   Just worship here.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.860]   The reason why I talk about this too is because I do believe that our church is under threat.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:40.420]   I have been kind of reading and also thinking that a church, it's not just our church, any
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:46.060]   church that says, "We are a Bible-teaching church designed to convict the membership
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:52.180]   of obeying the Scriptures all the way through, even if it's hard."
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:57.460]   The rest of the modern day, I think, you know, Christianity and mainstream will say, "What
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.460]   are you guys doing?
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.300]   That's so self-righteous, legalistic.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.780]   You're kind of a rule-meister, but that's not who God is."
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.620]   You probably already have heard stuff like that.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.260]   Or somebody will say, "You know, we're better than that.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.220]   We find our strength in diversity.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:17.960]   We have differences of opinions.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.020]   We have different look on religion."
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:25.140]   Or maybe even someone will say, "No, no, we're even more noble than even that."
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:32.140]   As opposed to having this like stickler to the Scriptures, we're going to progress beyond
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:37.100]   that and we're going to experience greater experience of religion because God is not
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.820]   a stale old God.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.100]   He is a live God and we're going to be experiencing Him in newfound ways.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:49.100]   There's an entire class of what's called progressive Christianity that desires to move on this.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:54.760]   Brothers and sisters, we need to be strong.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:01.340]   And that strength is going to come from an extremely exacting, vigorous dedication that
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:06.220]   I am going to abide by the Word of God because the Word of God is ancient, unmoving, it's
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.620]   old, and that does not make it uncool.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.300]   It makes it everlasting.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.180]   It doesn't change today, it doesn't change tomorrow.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.980]   The Word of God is sure, the Word of God is perfect.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.980]   And I thank God that God gave Joshua such a clear path.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.220]   If God says, "Oh my goodness, Joshua, you have to be so strong.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.440]   I don't know anything about those pagans over there, but you got to find out what their
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.440]   plans are.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.060]   I want to make sure that you train your people the right way.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.540]   You got to be up to date with all the weaponry."
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:38.260]   No, no, God said, "Let me just make it simple for you, Joshua.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.860]   I've given it to you.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.220]   It's not up there in the sky."
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:46.660]   Moses says to the people, "The Word of God is near you and I've explained it repeatedly
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.980]   to you.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.660]   Now we must obey."
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.740]   That makes us strong Christians, amen?
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.660]   We don't have to have novel new thoughts.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.180]   That's not what Christianity is about.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.780]   Nowadays, if you have a new angle, you saw scripture in a new light, you become a thought
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.180]   leader online.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:11.540]   No, we have the gospel handed down to us by the saints, by the prophets, and Jesus
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:15.140]   Christ our Lord, and we abide.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.660]   I love that because I am not a creative person.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.420]   I just need to follow.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.900]   Let that be a source of encouragement to you.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:30.100]   Now, I do want to take us down this interesting journey because the moment in Joshua is a
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.100]   buildup.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:37.980]   It is a buildup of Moses trying to lead the people and saying, "Do you understand how
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.540]   important, how consequential it is for you to heed and obey God?"
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.100]   I'm going to go through several passages for you and just turn your Bible to Deuteronomy
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:52.220]   26, and we're going to do one of those run along the passages in the scriptures.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:58.300]   The thing about it is God drew it out of them, meaning He gathered the people, rallied them
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.860]   up and said, "We're going to go into the promised land.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.740]   Here we are, plains of Moab, you see Jericho."
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:09.580]   In that moment, God drew out of them and said, "Covenant with me.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.420]   Tell me you're going to obey."
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.620]   Then so in Joshua 26 is covenanting.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:20.180]   In verse 16 says, "This day the Lord your God commands you to do these statutes and
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.180]   ordinances.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:25.040]   You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and all your soul.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.080]   You have declared that the Lord is your God and that you would walk in His ways, keep
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.600]   His statutes and commandments and His ordinance and listen to His voice.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.640]   And the Lord today declared to you to be His people."
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   Amen.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.000]   That's the scenario.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   That whole conversation of the gathering of the people, they are covenanting with God
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.920]   and saying, "God, we'll obey you."
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.720]   And then what's more, chapter 27, if you scan it, you'll notice it says, "Cursed,
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.720]   cursed, cursed, cursed."
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.200]   And the reason why is because Moses said to all the people and charged the people saying,
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.280]   "Keep all the commandments which I command you today, otherwise be cursed."
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:12.520]   So in case you missed it, there are incredible consequences to your disobedience and any
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.520]   kind of compromise.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.740]   Let me just say this for a moment.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:24.740]   I do believe subconsciously, not explicitly, not arrogant rebellionly, but subconsciously,
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:29.420]   New Testament Christians are in danger because we believe there are no consequences to sin.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.580]   That because of grace, we're excused from all the ramifications of sin.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.860]   That is not true.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:40.020]   You know how sometimes when we read the Old Testament, it feels a little weird because
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.540]   if I said something like this, "You obey and you will be prosperous and God will watch
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.140]   your way."
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.620]   Feels a little bit like health and wealth, right?
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.860]   Kind of like up to you, when you work hard, God will bless you kind of theology.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.340]   But let me put it in another way.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.740]   If you disobey God, you will be weak.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.700]   That's a truism.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:06.780]   And what he says is he warns, chapter 27, in your relationship with God, if you disobey,
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.340]   you will be cursed.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.100]   Now I want to make the distinction, Old Testament and New Testament is different.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.420]   God actually says within this context that I have not given the Spirit to them.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.720]   He says that.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.860]   To us we have the Spirit, but does that mean since we have the Spirit, we're more excused
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.660]   from His curses?
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.840]   Actually the opposite, right?
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.620]   Since we have the Spirit, are we more just simply guarded from the penalties and the
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.980]   ramifications of sin?
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.380]   No.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.140]   God actually says when the time of judgment comes, I will hold you account for everything
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.740]   I gave you, my word, my Spirit, and more.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.900]   Let me move on.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:52.180]   To highlight even more how imperative it is that we have this strength to say, "God, I'll
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.180]   obey your word.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:58.140]   I'll do no matter how inconvenient, no matter how stressful, no matter how much I think
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.060]   it will not work, I'll do it."
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.700]   He says there's also blessings for you.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.780]   Chapter 28 of Deuteronomy is all about blessings.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.140]   I'll read verse 1.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.460]   Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful to do all His
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.420]   commandments which I command you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.460]   the nations of the earth.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:22.660]   All these blessings will come upon you, right, and overtake you if you obey the Lord.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:27.860]   So in case we're kind of missing it, He just repeats over and over again, "You have to
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.460]   obey and listen to Me."
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.460]   And then He warns you, "If you don't, this is a ramification."
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.380]   And then He motivates you, "If you do, these are the blessings."
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.760]   And He continues on.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.340]   Let me read for you Deuteronomy 28 verse 15.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.240]   Chapter 28 verse 15.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:48.500]   He says, "It shall come about, if you do not obey the Lord your God, to observe to do all
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:53.700]   of His commandments and His statutes which I charge you today, that all these curses
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.680]   will come upon you and overtake you."
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:59.940]   I'm going to enter into a time now of reading some of the things that God says about His
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:09.760]   curses and it's going to be, in my eyes, incredibly, incredibly gloomy but scary and fearsome.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:19.200]   In Deuteronomy 28 verse 55, well, before that, verse 35, Deuteronomy 28, 35, okay, He says,
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:25.600]   "The Lord will strike you on the knees and legs with sores and boils from which you cannot
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600]   heal."
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600]   Wow.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.840]   Doesn't that sober you?
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:34.200]   He said, "What?"
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:39.360]   In that passage, He'll talk about how pagan nations will take your wives and children
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.440]   and you will never get them back.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.960]   Verse 55, "If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:53.560]   in the book to fear this honored and awesome name, the Lord your God, then the Lord will
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:00.000]   bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, even severe lasting plagues,
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.040]   miserable chronic sicknesses."
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   If you read chapter 26 through 28, it's almost like, like, you almost have to sigh, like,
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.440]   "Oh, my goodness, did we just read that?"
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:18.680]   But here is why I say is because for the New Testament Christian, again, I've already made
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.520]   the kind of case to you, I think we may have the misconception that since I am underneath
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.200]   Christ, there are going to be no practical consequences to my sin.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:34.040]   But let me tell you, in this admonition for you to be strong, the weakest person is the
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:39.360]   person who is being disciplined by God Himself.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.800]   The weakest person is the person who is most far away from God's command, that he would
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:50.280]   be far from the Lord, the Holy One, to the degree that God Himself is hurting you.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.800]   Yes?
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:57.280]   And God has said, "If you are my true child, I will always make sure you get disciplined
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   and you learn."
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:07.520]   So, brothers and sisters, like, when we think about strength, it is not health and wealth
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:14.440]   for me to think I have to obey because I want to be underneath the graces of God.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.240]   That's not legalistic.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.080]   That's not health and wealth.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.400]   It's the reality of affairs, that our obedience and disobedience has incredible consequences
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.640]   for our relationship with God, my personal well-being, and this entire church.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:34.680]   And the standard of holiness that is existing in our community is always going to be under
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.080]   threat.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:41.520]   You think about things like sexual purity, that's going to be under threat.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.080]   More and more, we're going to say, "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.200]   Everybody does it.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.360]   Everybody has this problem.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.960]   It's okay."
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.560]   But Scripture says, "Let there not be even a hint of sexual morality."
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   Talk about greed.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.320]   "It's okay, I struggle with this too, trying to buy stuff I can't afford.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.040]   It's okay, we always do this stuff, trying to take loans I can't pay back."
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.400]   But the Scripture says, "Do not have greed in your heart.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.600]   Don't even let that take root in here.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.840]   Don't even let it start.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.800]   Let there not be even a seed of greed inside of you.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.000]   Completely expunge that out of your life."
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.120]   So Scripture's expectation of us in the New Testament is a higher standard, actually.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:26.000]   Somehow we've reversed that to think that the New Testament is less.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.880]   Brethren and sisters, I'm saying that our obedience and the vigor that we take to obey
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:37.760]   the Lord is of great, great importance because God has said that is going to predicate your
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.760]   success.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.080]   Isn't that what He's saying?
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.160]   Only then will you be successful.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:50.000]   And this, with that, I want to move to the next point, is that I want you to be strong
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.400]   in God's purpose.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.120]   We need to be strong in what God defines as success.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.160]   We need to be strong in what God defines as the blessing He is giving to us.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.640]   We're not going to be strong just because I'm strong because I am a go-getter.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.220]   We're not going to be strong because I'm a person who doesn't give up.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.240]   You can not give up on something and it'd be completely a waste of time.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.600]   I didn't put it up here because I thought it was a little inappropriate, but there was
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.160]   this photo of this man.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.160]   It's a meme.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.480]   It says, "Excellence."
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.680]   And what he's done, he took rubber bands and he made a massive ball the size of his body,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.680]   right?
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:35.800]   But he's sitting next to it and it says, "Excellence in vanity," right?
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.740]   In stupidity and folly.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.240]   Just being a go-getter is nothing.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.880]   We need to seek that which God says, "This is my vision of success for you."
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:53.400]   Even if it's, yes, really painful and I guess inconvenient or not in line with what we would
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.640]   think is success, God says, "That's what you have to do."
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:03.640]   Take a moment to look at what verse 10 through 15 of Joshua chapter 1 says.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.840]   In Joshua chapter 1, 10 through 15, God uses the word "give" in so many different ways.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.640]   He repeats actually in chapter 1 12 times.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.200]   "I gave you, I'm giving you, and I will give you."
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.600]   And the thing about what he says is, "I am giving you this land to possess it.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   Yes, and amen."
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.840]   This is a promise he has given from almost 480 years ago when he gave that promise to
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.840]   Abraham and now it's coming to fruition.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.920]   Amen.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:34.560]   But on top of what he said is, "I am going to give you," verse 13, "Remember the word
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.160]   which Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, saying, 'The Lord your God gives you
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   rest.'"
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.920]   And he gives you this land.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.440]   And it says, "Your wives, your little ones, your cattle will remain in the land which
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.920]   Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:59.840]   array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help until the Lord gives your brothers,"
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.840]   what?
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:07.360]   "Rest as he gives you, and they shall then possess the land which the Lord your God is
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   giving them.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.640]   Then you shall return to your own land, possess that which Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.440]   gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.520]   This point I haven't just truthfully speaking, it's just a huge massive point so I haven't
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520]   thought of it exhaustively.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:30.240]   But what I'm trying to get at is what has plagued mankind, what has plagued all of Israelite
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.160]   history is God says, "I am going to give you," right?
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.760]   And they say, "What?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.240]   I can't wait for that child now."
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.600]   So they have it through the maid, right?
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.520]   "I am going to give you a king."
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.880]   No, God actually said, "This is the kind of king I want.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.760]   This is the kind of king and this is what he's going to do."
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.880]   And they say, "No, we want Saul."
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   So many times without waiting for God's provision, people have essentially envisioned their own
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.660]   success.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.880]   And what God is telling us is actually that he has a desire to give us far beyond just
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.080]   the land but rest.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:10.640]   And what that means to me is God is giving us a kind of grace, yes, that he has devised.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.760]   Apostle Paul says it in another way.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.600]   In 2 Corinthians 12, verse 9-10, he says, "I have this thorn on my side and I've asked
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.160]   God multiple times, three times."
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.360]   I'm pretty sure he asked it more, okay?
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.160]   "Three times, 'Will you remove this thorn from my side?'"
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.800]   And then this is what God has said.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.400]   Verse 9, "He has said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400]   in weakness.'"
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.000]   I don't know if I can fully wrap my head around all of that.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.240]   But he says, "Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast in my weakness so that the
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.200]   power of Christ may dwell in me.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.480]   Therefore I am well content with weaknesses.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.920]   I can have insults, distress, persecutions, and difficulties, all for Christ's sake,
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.000]   for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.360]   That is not just wordplay.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.080]   I believe what more precisely he's saying is, yes, you can have categorically all the
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.480]   things the world will deem you as a failure.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.960]   You have people rejecting you.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.360]   You have people hating you.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.920]   You lose relationships.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.880]   You can lose all your money.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   Failure, okay?
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.960]   But God has for you an entirely different definition of success, which is, "You have
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.480]   been graced by me.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.800]   I gave you rest from all that.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.160]   I gave you the sufficiency of Christ, His Spirit, and therefore dare we not settle for
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.000]   anything less than the blessing of God, amen?
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.160]   It would be radically, radically us settling for trash if I said, 'No, God, give me today
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.600]   that house, the car, the people, the friends, and the money.'"
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.280]   One hundred percent failure.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.880]   And the reason why I say this is because back in Deuteronomy, God in His sovereignty was
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.600]   doing this thing.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.520]   Their weakness, His grace.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.200]   Their weakness, His grace.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.320]   I already highlighted to you that God has predicted their failure, miserable failure.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.880]   Take another look at Deuteronomy 30, verse 1 through 3.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   Deuteronomy 30, verse 1 through 3.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.520]   In this idea of failure and yet graced, He says, "So it shall be when all these things
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.880]   have come upon you, the blessings and curses which I have set before you, and you call
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:29.520]   them to mind in all nations where the Lord your God has banished you.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.400]   And yet you return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart, soul, according
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.720]   to all that I have commanded you today, you and your sons.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.800]   Then the Lord your God will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you and will
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.680]   gather you again from all the people where the Lord your God has scattered you."
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.400]   That to me is difficult to wrap your mind around.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.320]   But He says, "Right now I am commanding you to obey and have a successful entrance into
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:07.000]   the promised land," but He says, "You're going to experience banishment because of your sins."
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.440]   And if I was Moses, I would just be dumbfounded.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.400]   What do you mean?
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.600]   These people are going to go through banishment and you're going to hide your face and you're
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.360]   going to listen to them and you're going to bless them?
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.300]   But God says, "But I, I will restore them."
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:30.520]   And that last day where God has emptied them, He has humbled them, and then He has restored
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.500]   them, that was His purpose, was it not?
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:42.040]   It was for Him to give His grace and His blessing all apart from our own flesh.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:50.120]   And so I will, I will just say, all I have to say about that is, Lord, perhaps sometimes
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.680]   the hardest time for me to be strong is when I'm staring at my own weakness square in the
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.520]   face.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:04.680]   If I have failed or sinned in any way, outbursts of anger, greed, lust, right, selfishness
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:12.440]   and pride, too many to speak of, those are the times when I'm most not motivated because
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.360]   all I want to do is go hide.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.840]   All I want to do is not think about my failure.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.480]   But God says, "Remember, my purpose is to restore you."
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.400]   And I wanted to give every single one of you that encouragement today.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.080]   God has told you He will not leave you or forsake you.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:32.600]   God has told you, "I have provided you and I have given you promises."
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:37.000]   And just like every servant of God has been told, "I will be there for you to restore
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.180]   you and to bring you up," our Lord Jesus Christ has told us, "I am with you, lo, to the end
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.180]   of the age."
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:48.380]   And He has also said that He is going to perfect you.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:55.940]   And so my desire to obey the Lord fully, to be more like Christ, to strive for perfection,
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.460]   it's not hindered by my weaknesses.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:03.340]   I am actually so challenged that God sees it all and is bringing perfection.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:09.380]   Now with that said then, I want to close by saying God has commanded every single one
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:13.980]   of you to be strong and courageous and it does not have to look like you're this articulate
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:20.940]   person with words to say and you're just destroying people with your arguments.
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:25.020]   That's one type of strength, intellectual.
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:31.780]   God says, "I want you to be so strong in me, so strong then in my presence, so strong in
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:39.660]   my provision, my plans, my will and purposes, everything has to do with me.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.660]   And I don't want you to be this wishy-washy like, "Oh, I don't know.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.620]   I don't know what we're going to do next season."
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:45.620]   Yeah, you do.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:46.620]   You're going to love God.
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:47.620]   You're going to evangelize.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:51.860]   You're going to take over the world, not by way of might or power intellect, but by the
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:52.860]   gospel.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:32:00.300]   And you will have no fear because you know God is with you and He will not forsake you.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:07.700]   Let's pray.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:15.980]   Lord God, we thank you for your mercies and grace that continues to just forgive our sins.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.420]   And sometimes, Lord, even in well-intended ways of maybe wanting to be strong, we can
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:26.900]   pervert that by trying to be strong by my own intellect, willpower, and strength.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:31.340]   But I pray, Lord, that our true strength would come from your presence.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:36.740]   And God, we've been at our church talking a lot about prayer so that we would know what
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:42.480]   it means to be strong in the spirit versus strong in form and function.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.660]   And God, we know that we'll probably need many reminders of this.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.500]   Thank you for the reminder today.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:55.580]   And it is my prayer that anybody here going through worries, anxieties, despair, and fear,
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:59.980]   would you, Lord, strengthen their heart and mind to know, Father God, that you are the
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:04.740]   one who goes before us, you are the one who surrounds us, you are the one who grants us
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.740]   strength.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.740]   We thank you.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.740]   It's in Christ's name.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.740]   Amen.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:21.740]   Let us stand together for a closing praise.

[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   >> Amen. Let's close in a word of prayer together.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.740]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.740]   Your grace is upon us, Lord, and God, you have sustained us
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:45.740]   through all of our individual lives.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   You sustained this church and all the saints in this world.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   God, you hold by your powerful hand.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:57.740]   And Lord, we pray, God, that we would be heeding this word to be strong.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:03.740]   Perhaps we feel now a lot of worries and concerns about where just the generation, culture,
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.740]   whatever it may be, that the wickedness of our day may be headed.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:12.740]   But on another thought, God, we have not experienced the kind of suffering
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.740]   that's even close to the nation of Israel or your son, Jesus Christ.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:22.740]   So, Lord, help us, knowing that the spiritual battle is going to get more intense,
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:25.740]   knowing, Father God, that there are difficulties ahead,
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:32.740]   help us to find true strength, not simply of manpower or of our own flesh, but truly in Christ.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:35.740]   And now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:39.740]   to make you stand in the presence of his glory, blameless with great joy,
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:42.740]   through the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.740]   Amen.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:53.740]   God sent his Son.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:59.740]   They called him Jesus.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:04.740]   He came to love.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   He went for a gift.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   He lived and died.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:19.740]   To buy my pardon.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:29.740]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived.
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:39.740]   Because he lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:49.740]   Because he lived, all fear is gone.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:59.740]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:09.740]   And life is worth the living just because he lived.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:12.740]   Amen.
