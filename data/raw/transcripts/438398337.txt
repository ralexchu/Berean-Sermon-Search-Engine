[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Hello everyone.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.360]   Hope you guys are having a great week in the Lord.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.840]   Let's take a moment to pray
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.920]   as we jump into our text for tonight.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.940]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.800]   Lord, we're truly grateful that God in this life
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   where we are besieged with attacks, distractions,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300]   where we have weaknesses within ourselves,
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.040]   where we also have our enemy trying to deceive us
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.480]   and attack us.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   We thank you so much God
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.160]   that you grant to us so much in Christ.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.720]   God that you grant to us his power and strength,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.280]   but also Father God, the light of your word
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.460]   and a ministry of your Holy Spirit.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.440]   We're also so thankful for the church
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.660]   that God in fellowship together,
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.360]   we can in many ways bind together,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.720]   staying strong, standing firm
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.360]   against all the tide of the generations.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.840]   So God through our study tonight,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   would you continue to build us up?
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.580]   God that we would be strong in you.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940]   We thank you it's in Christ name we pray, amen.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.800]   Okay.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.740]   Well, as we continue on the study of the book of Ephesians,
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.960]   as you recall, we are in a section
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160]   where we are talking about applications
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.440]   of everything that we've been learning.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.740]   And if you think about it,
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.540]   in this section so far,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.820]   we've talked about like family relationships,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.700]   submission to each other, the character,
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.140]   but here and now in this section,
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.340]   we're talking about standing firm in the Lord, being strong.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580]   And there's so much terminology
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.700]   that's related to a fight, okay?
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.720]   Let's take a look through the passage
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.740]   and for the sake of getting the whole paragraph,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.640]   I'm going to read to us the entire section.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.540]   It says, "Finally be strong in the Lord
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840]   and the strength of his might.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.500]   Put on the full armor of God
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.420]   so that you will be able to stand firm
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.900]   against the schemes of the devil.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.560]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.500]   but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.180]   against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.020]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.860]   in the heavenly places.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.020]   Therefore take up the full armor of God
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.300]   so that you will be able to resist in the evil day.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020]   And having done everything to stand firm,
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.060]   stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.900]   and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.860]   and having shod your feet with the preparation
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860]   of the gospel of peace.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.860]   In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.420]   with which you will be able to extinguish
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.740]   the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.360]   And take the helmet of salvation
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.540]   and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.860]   With all prayer and petition, pray at all times
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.060]   in the spirit.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.300]   And with this in view, be on the alert
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.580]   with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.620]   And pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.680]   in the opening of my mouth to make known the boldness
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.500]   of the mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.740]   For which I am an ambassador in chains,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.620]   that in proclaiming it, I may speak boldly
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.660]   as I ought to speak."
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.780]   Now, jumping right into the passage,
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.380]   there is a strong exhortation for us,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.680]   strong exhortation for us to be strong.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.980]   He says, "Finally be strong in the Lord."
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.500]   And whenever the command is given,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.740]   there are sometimes commands
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.240]   that are a little bit more complicated.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.220]   And then there are commands that is just straightforward.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.580]   You need to be strong.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.700]   But I think sometimes we kind of,
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.980]   because it's so straightforward,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.780]   we glance over and then move on.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.380]   But it's important for you to ask,
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.980]   do I understand the kind of strength he wants me to have?
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.660]   Do I have a picture of the kind of fortitude, right?
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.500]   That God wants us to exhibit in this life.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.160]   And the idea here, the expectation for you
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.120]   is to have all kinds of strengths.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920]   Take a look at all the various ways
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.740]   that God has described the strength you need
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.700]   in this, I guess you can say last hour
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300]   or the evil day or the time to come,
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.660]   the struggle that we're engaged in now.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.740]   He talked about standing firm.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.980]   So you should be able to resist, right?
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.100]   You should be able to hold your ground, so to speak.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.500]   You shouldn't be a pushover.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.020]   It talks about the struggle.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.720]   Like you're supposed to be engaged
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.460]   in a kind of a combative struggle,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.660]   a fight that is both defensive and offensive.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.820]   When you look at the various pieces of the army,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.100]   you'll notice that there are multiple elements to this.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.740]   He talks about a kind of strength that's full.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.920]   He talks about, again, being able to resist
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.340]   and to stand firm.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.820]   So when you take a look at all this,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.720]   I mean, the emphasis is very clear.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   God wants you as an individual in Christ to be very strong.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.540]   Another passage I wanna turn to
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.260]   just by way of a cross-reference,
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.420]   as Apostle Paul says,
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.620]   "As a prayer for the church and every Christian,"
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.020]   he says in Philippians,
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.660]   "This I pray that your love may abound still more and more
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.980]   in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.220]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.020]   in order to be sincere and blameless
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.460]   until the day of Christ,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.700]   having been filled with the fruit of righteousness,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.060]   which comes through Jesus Christ
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.140]   to the glory and praise of God."
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.420]   Now, this prayer doesn't include things like
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420]   military battle strength,
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.340]   being prepared in that kind of fashion,
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.700]   but it talks about you growing all the way up to the end,
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.500]   having sincerity and blamelessness and righteousness,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.260]   and so when I ask the question again,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.340]   do you understand what it means to be strong, right?
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.980]   I hope you're not thinking just like,
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.940]   "Ugh," that kind of strong,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.780]   but obviously there's a strength here
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.500]   that Apostle Paul is praying for.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.140]   Can you use your love and your mind
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.740]   to discern what is pleasing to God,
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.740]   what is excellent in His eyes?
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.100]   Can you approve of what is true and godly,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.620]   and can you be so clear that you're sincere and blameless
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.980]   all the way through?
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.100]   So again, contributing to the idea
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.620]   of what does it mean to be strong.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.820]   Now, this passage describes to us
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.780]   even more of what it means to be strong
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.180]   by describing the context
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   and the means by which you're supposed to be strong,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.060]   which is both in the Lord
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.500]   and in the strength of His might.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.940]   Now, we can talk so much about in the Lord
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.420]   and the strength of His might,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.580]   but you guys remember the chapters one through three.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580]   It was through His exhibition of His love
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.620]   and His might that He accomplished redemption.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.740]   Through the power that is in Christ,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.820]   He is changing and transforming you, right?
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.740]   But within all this,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.100]   one of the highlights that I would like to say is
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.500]   there is clearly a concept of dependency, okay?
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.420]   Clearly a concept of dependency.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.900]   I think I'd like to take a moment
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.580]   to just meditate on this a little bit.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.020]   I think in our day,
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.980]   I think that in meditation upon this idea of strength,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.820]   that right now there is this kind of sentiment and talk
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.220]   that maybe is a little too accustomed to failure.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.860]   And what I mean by that is sometimes
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.620]   when I even look up people talking about leadership
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.420]   or what is the regular Christian experience,
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.100]   they almost talk as though it's like,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.980]   yeah, we all know what it means to fail
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.940]   again and again and again.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.620]   And as a leader, you're not like way up there
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.180]   telling all the people, come on, come on.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.580]   You're pretty much failing with other people
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.860]   and just encouraging them, let's just keep going, right?
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.980]   Well, clearly the expectation for you is not,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.420]   you know, you're going to fail all the time,
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.860]   but so long as you're in the Lord, it's okay.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.180]   Like that is not necessarily the picture
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   that this passage depicts.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.260]   The passage depicts you standing your ground
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.700]   in the Lord, depending on Him.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.180]   The other extreme error is for you to think
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.620]   that by stacking up as much Bible knowledge as you can,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.860]   you're going to be so strong
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.620]   that you don't need to daily rely on the Lord.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.620]   That somehow, or even on a daily level,
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.780]   that because you did your devotion in the morning,
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.780]   that through the day, you don't need to rely on Him.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.540]   That would be another misconception, right?
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.660]   There is this idea here, you're supposed to abide in Christ
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.500]   and Christ has already told us, by yourself, completely lost.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.380]   By yourself, incapable.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.860]   By yourself, nothing is possible.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.700]   But in the Lord, all is possible, right?
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.700]   So the question here is,
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.780]   do you understand this expectation for you?
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.700]   Like what it means to be strong in the Lord
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.980]   for you in your day, okay?
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.980]   Next, point two.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.380]   He says, in relation to you being strong,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.340]   what you need to do, this is so instructional,
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.020]   is you need to put on the full armor of God, okay?
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.300]   Put on the full armor of God.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.700]   Now, we're going to talk about
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.340]   all the different pieces later.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.420]   And again, such a straightforward command, right?
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.620]   We don't need to sit here and say,
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.420]   what it means to put on is, right?
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.060]   You need to make sure you're grabbing every single piece
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.380]   that you can and put on the full armor of the Lord.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   What's interesting though, is that passage,
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.500]   it highlights this idea of putting on the armor of God,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.900]   but it pauses to give you the motivation.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.940]   The motivation is so that you,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.020]   you as a child of God, you as a Christian,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.500]   you will be able to stand firm, okay?
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.460]   Now, I want you guys to think about this a little bit.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.260]   There is this like exhortation
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.980]   and there is this motivation given to you.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.420]   Like, you're going to be able to do this
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.260]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.900]   So I totally imagine right now,
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.300]   there's in this passage already a sentiment of the soldier.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.140]   And so I imagine the drill inspector saying,
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.500]   you need to get ready, you know?
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   And I'll tell you honestly,
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.420]   recently I've been researching a lot about like home defense
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.660]   with all the stuff going on,
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.620]   but also, you know, I see the news
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.900]   and sometimes there are some things
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.860]   like happening close to my home.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.980]   My wife and I have been watching like preparedness
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.820]   and readiness.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.180]   Do we know an escape plan?
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.820]   Step one, like, do you know like,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.060]   what are the vulnerable portions of your house?
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.060]   I just want to warn you,
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.220]   don't get too caught up into some of those videos
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.060]   because man, paranoia is like through the roof, okay?
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.500]   But I got to tell you something,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.700]   in a desire to get ready, I bought Bia
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.180]   or I asked Bia to order on Amazon some pepper spray,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.100]   one pepper spray, one for her, one for me, okay?
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.140]   So we feel a little bit more ready for danger
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.740]   because we can spray somebody in the eye.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.540]   Now, the thing about it is there's all these videos
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.180]   and there was, I came across a guy,
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.020]   I'm not going to name him,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.420]   it's a pretty interesting YouTube channel.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   And he said he is so in love with ready and preparedness
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.500]   that he decked out his home and his car.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.860]   And because I like cars and stuff,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.900]   I was like, ooh, that's interesting.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   I looked it up and in his car, he had three pistols,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.460]   one AR rifle, four gloves,
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.700]   a rain jacket that has easy access to his pistols.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.500]   He had specialty umbrellas, tactical flashlights.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.860]   He had an ankle first aid kit, an ankle handcuff kit.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.900]   He had a large first aid kit.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.740]   He had extra magazines and different doorwells of his car.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.460]   Underneath his kids, he had a kid's car seat.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.660]   Underneath, he had extra magazines.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   And then at a certain moment, he kind of paused like,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.500]   hey, chill out, man.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.220]   I don't got no more room, okay?
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.220]   And then he started going off
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.220]   about how prepared and ready he was.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.460]   He had a backpack in case he needed to go off into the woods
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.940]   that he would survive for three days.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.680]   And he's going around his car
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.540]   showing how ready and prepared he is.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.500]   And I thought that was pretty hilarious.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.380]   Now, that kind of made me think about it a little bit.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.220]   I laugh at him because, man, at some point,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.820]   I mean, are you really gonna stick a rifle
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.580]   underneath your kid's car seat?
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.220]   Are you really gonna stick just magazines
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.900]   of bullets and ammunition all over your vehicle?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.460]   And the reason why that looks kind of silly is because,
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.460]   why does that look silly, right?
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.560]   Just take a moment to think about that.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.420]   Before I give the answer,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.540]   take a moment to think about why is that silly
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.700]   when a man drives around with essentially a fortified truck?
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.340]   The reason why is 'cause it may or may not happen.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.220]   Yeah?
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.780]   It's kind of like, don't you get annoyed
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.500]   when those people, right, who are like,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.060]   "Oh, no, I need to take a light sweater,
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.220]   "a thick sweater, whatever it may be,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.960]   "and just come on, we're just going out.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.380]   "It's not gonna rain, right?
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.740]   "It's not gonna be this, and it's not gonna be that."
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.740]   I mean, God willing, yeah,
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.140]   I hope I never have to use my pepper spray.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.780]   So in my mind, it's like having a little bottle
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   sitting on the side of this or that or on my key chain.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.940]   That's no big deal to me, so I don't look like a fool.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.480]   But imagine the guy who has the tactical hat.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.540]   He's got tactical glasses, tactical gloves,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.540]   and he's walking around like he's ready for war,
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.180]   and you're just laughing, like, "Come on, man.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.060]   "That's not gonna happen in your day."
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.180]   I mean, what are the chances?
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.700]   You're probably gonna get hit by your truck
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.820]   before anything else happens.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.460]   Okay, but flip that around.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.420]   If it was certain that something would happen,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.740]   you would look like the fool, right?
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.860]   How many times have you said you've gone out,
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.740]   and you're just like blazing hot right now.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.460]   You go swimming, and you think in your mind,
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.140]   like, "I should probably put some sunblock on," right?
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.100]   But then you think in your mind,
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.840]   "Ah, I'm only gonna be out there for 30 minutes.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   "It's not gonna burn."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.060]   Who's the fool now, right?
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.980]   Like, you come back like, "Ah, I should've put
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.200]   "the sunblock on."
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.340]   You know it's gonna happen.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.760]   You know already it's super hot.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.040]   You know you're pale-skinned.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.200]   You know you're gonna burn.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.940]   But you go out there without your sunblock.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.360]   Who's the fool now?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.480]   Okay, why do I bring that up?
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.040]   It's because God is telling you
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.580]   to put on every single piece of the armor.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.200]   And yes, it may look foolish.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.380]   I mean, didn't it look foolish
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.800]   for the people to jump into a boat
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.840]   when there was no water?
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.480]   Didn't it look foolish to people
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.240]   to carry around the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.280]   a big old box?
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.360]   Didn't it look foolish to walk around the city?
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.000]   Everything that God is sometimes asking us to do
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.400]   looks a little foolish.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   For us to invest all this kind of time
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.040]   when you have your own studies to do,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.880]   to invest all this kind of man hours
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.940]   and your brain power and all this kind of stuff
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.640]   for services, for prayer,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.260]   all this kind of stuff when you're already busy,
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.120]   when you're already tired
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.800]   with your family responsibilities.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.000]   There is a foolishness when the world looks at us
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.100]   like why are you investing in all that?
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.400]   Don't you know you'd be a lot more comfortable
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.500]   if you didn't have all this gear on you?
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.640]   Not walking around with antiquated stuff over your feet
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.060]   and big old belts and breastplates.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.380]   Like who wears that now?
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.660]   Okay, you see what I'm saying?
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.120]   But who's the fool?
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.260]   When God has already told us,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.820]   this is a guarantee.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.600]   Anybody who desires to live a godly life
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.460]   will be persecuted.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.780]   Who's the fool when God has already told you
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.100]   there is an enemy prowling around
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.740]   looking for you when you're not ready?
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.300]   There are enemies, there are forces attacking you.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.340]   And for you to think it's not gonna happen,
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.200]   lost, already lost.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.940]   That's what I'm talking about right here.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.840]   As I meditated upon this idea
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.740]   of put on the full armor of God
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.940]   and he's trying to reason with you.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.500]   It's probably because we're sitting here like
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.000]   do we really need that though?
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.620]   Do I really need to be ready with all those pieces?
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.820]   Won't I look silly?
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   But then he says, yes, the devil is scheming.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.660]   The devil is going to attack you
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.620]   and you're the one who needs to be able to discern
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.020]   to either say, no, that is of satanic force,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.660]   that is of darkness or prove yes, this is of God.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.980]   And you can't sit there and be like,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.940]   but wait a minute, God, aren't you gonna protect me?
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.580]   Aren't you almighty?
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.380]   Aren't you sovereign?
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.820]   I thought you were gonna protect me.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.700]   God has already told you,
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.900]   I have given you every resource in Christ.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.380]   I have given you the word of God.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.320]   I've given you the spirit.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   I've given you the church.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.600]   I've given all that is necessary for our life and godliness,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.540]   but you must be strong.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.820]   God is not going to do for you
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.900]   what he deemed as already good for his children
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.060]   for you to do.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.180]   And so this is a strong exhortation
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.820]   and part of me as I'm meditating, I was like, man,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:24.860]   just my own resistance to not want to do some things,
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.100]   you know, realizing even if let's say
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.580]   I had no like rebellious part of me,
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.580]   God, if I came to you thinking like,
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.420]   do I really need that?
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.220]   All questioning your warning,
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.580]   your forewarning of what's gonna happen.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.700]   I wanna have greater faith.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.060]   God, I am ready.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.420]   I want to be ready for what you say
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.020]   is already going to come.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.140]   What you say is already here.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.080]   What you say is already the danger zone.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.980]   We're in a spiritual battle
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.280]   and we need to be able to withstand all that
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.860]   because Satan, he's going to use every wind of doctrine,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.200]   the trickery of men, deceitful scheming.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.420]   People will entice you with both allurements and lies,
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.900]   just like they did Jesus.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.280]   Why don't you say this?
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.660]   Just like they would do, are you hungry?
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.820]   Of course I'm hungry.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.580]   I just fasted for work, right?
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.220]   Like, why don't you have this?
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.380]   You know, one of the things I was thinking about,
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.220]   Satan is going to push every underlying button.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.660]   Did God really say that?
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.460]   Why don't you exercise your strength?
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.060]   Shouldn't you deserve a little better?
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.900]   Why don't you have more?
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.180]   Shouldn't you have more?
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.040]   You know what I was thinking the other day?
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.060]   As I was preparing for this, I was thinking,
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.020]   Satan told the son of God,
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.420]   bow and I'll give you all of this.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.120]   To me, that's just kind of like hard to wrap my mind around.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.060]   Like Satan knew this potentially could be the Messiah,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.900]   but decided to attack him and say,
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.940]   let me give you all of this, right?
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.520]   And then you started thinking like, how would I,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.560]   how would our modern 2020 young man react to all that?
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.940]   Perhaps Satan saw me, caught me staring at
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.900]   the stuff that I want so badly.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.360]   How many people window shop through their phones
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.180]   all day long?
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.340]   Some days I'm sitting there,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.780]   I'm not even really interested in actually buying it,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.980]   but I'm just like window shopping.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.780]   Maybe some of you are like, aha, this is great.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.300]   'Cause I've been already collecting some of that.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.780]   I've got a little collection of my own,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.020]   but it'd be great if I could have a big collection.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.700]   I wonder, we are in a generation
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.420]   where people love collection of this, collection of that.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.380]   Look at this, I've got a showcase.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.260]   What do you, if in your heart, you're starting to think,
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.600]   I need a bigger barn for my collection, right?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.820]   That's not me being extra harsh again,
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.340]   'cause I feel the rebuke here.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.720]   That's our Lord saying there was a man who was a fool
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.260]   'cause he did not know what day or time
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.060]   his life would be a part of him.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.140]   But he sat there building up his barn saying,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.900]   I need a bigger barn and then a bigger barn
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.740]   and then a bigger barn.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.060]   Do not fall to that kind of temptation.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.260]   We are all susceptible.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.340]   The temptation and the schemes of the devil
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.380]   are so deceptive.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.800]   And some of us may initially be like, that looks great.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.620]   But remember, we have to exercise our strength,
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.780]   the mental battle, the spiritual battle,
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.140]   the heart battle, right?
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.060]   It's not just all out there, it's right in here.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.340]   And he says that.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.660]   The struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.100]   It's not that guy.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.460]   It's not that girl.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.580]   It's not that person out there, right?
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.740]   The struggle is not just simply physical.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.780]   It's not just simply material.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.140]   As though all you need to do is just,
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.980]   I don't know what I'm gonna do,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.580]   I'm just gonna get rid of this thing.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.420]   As though that's gonna solve it, right?
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.380]   You know what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add this piece
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.540]   to my life.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.980]   He says, we are fighting against, and check this out,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.660]   the observation we make is there are rulers and powers
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.340]   and world forces of darkness,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.260]   spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenlies,
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.940]   in the heavenly places.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.300]   Do you believe that?
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.420]   To me, there was like this phase I went through, you know,
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.060]   where I was like, man, like this charismatic stuff
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.460]   where everybody's like, that's a demon
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.940]   and that's a demon and that's a demon.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.800]   Like, I was really turned off by that
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.020]   because my parents went to a really charismatic church.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.060]   And then when I got saved,
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.820]   I was at a very charismatic church.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.100]   So we saw a lot of this like, oh my gosh,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.780]   everybody got together and let's cast this out,
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.740]   like that kind of stuff.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.700]   That was my early, early first and second year
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.740]   of being a Christian.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.540]   And then so there was a part of me that hated it.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.740]   And then you start reading scripture
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.420]   and you realize like, there are demons, you know?
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.380]   The scripture tells you like,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.340]   there's so much more than meets the eye.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.860]   And then I remember this one season
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.460]   when my wife was a teacher,
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.540]   she recognized that even amongst some of the students
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.420]   in high school, there are dark forces at play.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.840]   Suppressive, I mean, if you want to talk about oppression,
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.300]   right now there's so much talk about oppression.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.820]   There are dark forces, even amongst the youth.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.540]   I think this past Sunday,
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.140]   I described this horrible scenario
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.060]   where the number three killer of all children,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.220]   18 and down is suicide.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.420]   There is a dark oppressive force that is lying,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.340]   saying just die and kill yourself.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.220]   You have no other option.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.940]   There's blinding the eyes to Christ,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.860]   blinding the eyes to the hope,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.780]   blinding eyes to the love of God
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.540]   and saying there's nothing for you.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.500]   That's oppression.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.060]   It's a dark force.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.500]   And then I remember a long time ago
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.220]   when my wife was telling me that actually
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.460]   there was a student who was engaged in satanic worship
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.140]   and I didn't know what to think about it.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.380]   So I went to Pastor Peter and I was like,
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.500]   Pastor Peter, my wife was talking about the student
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.420]   who had demonic experiences.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.780]   And Pastor Peter's like, oh, let me tell you the stories.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.620]   And I was like, what?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.740]   I was hoping, I was looking for encouragement
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.100]   that it wasn't existing or something like that, right?
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.380]   I was hoping you'd say it didn't exist.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.500]   And he's like, let me tell you the stories.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   The reason why I say that is because I do realize like,
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.900]   yeah, you can just turn your eye blindly
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.580]   to just think physically,
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.820]   but there are things happening
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.420]   that are far beyond just the physical.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.460]   And wow, we need to be praying then, shouldn't we?
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.780]   And what's more, are you able to tell the differences
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.240]   between the voice of God and the voice of Satan?
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.340]   Remember, the voice of Satan is going to sound beautiful.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.260]   Remember the image of Satan in the Bible
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.660]   is not like the things and the horns.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.060]   You guys have heard this many times, right?
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.060]   The image of Satan is like humanly and physically glorious,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.980]   like attractive, like beautiful to behold,
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.860]   like very, very alluring, right?
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.280]   And you think about that and there are so many things.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.020]   Now, just to be funny,
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.720]   'cause I just took this moment to jot down some things
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.660]   because I'm asking you this question right now, okay?
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.620]   What are the mantras?
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.680]   What are the voices of this world
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.620]   that are purely more demonic, earthly fleshly?
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.460]   And again, there's so many things attacking us, okay?
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.020]   As opposed to things that are godly.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.220]   You know what I hear a lot these days, mantras wise?
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.980]   Again, I heard some of you guys say it.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.100]   I'm not trying to pick on you.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.040]   It's okay, I know what you mean.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.260]   But in terms of the world, they say stuff like this.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.960]   You know, you gotta do what makes you happy.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.100]   No, you don't gotta.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.460]   Who said you gotta?
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.920]   You know, you gotta do you.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.000]   You be you, right?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.960]   Is that what the scripture says?
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.840]   No, no, that's satanic.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.900]   Jesus says you gotta deny yourself.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.460]   You got to kill that old man
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.960]   and you've gotta do what is pleasing to the Father
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.660]   and become more like Christ.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.840]   Here's another one.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.920]   Yolo, right?
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.260]   You only live once, which means to say,
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.420]   enjoy your small little time that you have
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.900]   because you're not gonna have any other time.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.000]   It sounds pretty good.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.540]   But satanic.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.760]   Every man is both destined to live only once,
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.700]   but he's going to face judgment for eternity.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.220]   Every life is eternal.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.280]   Every life is eternal.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   This whole philosophy of the world.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   You know, I remember thinking this one time.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.960]   I can't remember, but there was this moment
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.280]   when I was very tempted to compromise on,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.320]   like I was at this event
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.240]   and then I wanted to get some freebies.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.400]   And I remember like feeling really tempted to want freebies
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.240]   and then the part of me that just simply said,
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.080]   everyone's doing it.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.400]   Okay.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.440]   Do you realize everyone's doing it is pretty satanic too?
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.240]   I mean, and I think about that and I'm just like,
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.480]   Mark, you're so stupid, right?
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   You're so easily duped by that little voice in your head
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   that simply rationalizes your compromise
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.320]   and you just look around and say,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.200]   but everybody's doing it.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.000]   As if that was the barometer for the Christian.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.880]   I'm just talking about again, all the different deceptive.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.720]   It's just so easy.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.800]   So I hope I challenged you enough to say,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.760]   we have to be steady, alert, prepared.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.560]   Therefore put on the full armor of God.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.760]   Point four.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.640]   Therefore take up the full armor of God
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.560]   so that you will be able to resist in the evil day.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.960]   And having done everything to stand firm,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.600]   stand firm therefore having girded your loins with truth
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   and having shod your feet with the preparation
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.520]   of the gospel of peace.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.360]   Okay.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.400]   So the command again is to repeat,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   you need to put on the armor of God.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.240]   Okay.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.280]   Now what it did not say is you need to go kill Satan
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.000]   because that's Jesus's work.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.720]   And I want to remind you again,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   there is this tension in the scriptures.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.280]   It's like, get ready.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.200]   You need to be prepared.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.320]   Be sober.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.720]   Come on, stay awake.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.560]   Right.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.800]   But then the other part of it is like victory is yours.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.240]   I just want to remind you of that.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.920]   It did not say go and kill Satan.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   It says the victory is yours in Christ.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.240]   You need to abide in him.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.080]   Okay.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.520]   Now in thinking about that,
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   he gives you the armor of God starter pack.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.000]   There's three pieces at the very beginning.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.640]   And then it says, and then also,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.320]   and then it continues to more specific pieces.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.760]   The three pieces are, gird your loins.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.600]   Okay.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.040]   You've got people have the tunic thingy.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.320]   People have that long piece of cloth.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.800]   You got to be ready and you got to make sure everything
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.320]   is tied in with the truth.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.960]   You've got no straggling pieces.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.280]   The other day, I've got a big bruise right here
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.880]   because I had my earphones on.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.080]   And then I had this like little rotary tool
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.200]   and it caught the earphone.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.560]   I don't know why I didn't use a wireless one.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   Big mistake.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.040]   The cable came out, swung out from my phone,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.800]   slapped me in the hand, ripped my skin.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.040]   I have a fat bruise right here.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.880]   Okay.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.840]   That's why you don't let stuff hang loose.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.120]   Okay.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.440]   It's a great picture.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.520]   Let the truth create those parameters for you.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   Truth by nature excludes falsehood and folly and foolishness.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.040]   The more that you look at truth,
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.080]   the more the narrow your path will be straight to the Lord.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.920]   Okay.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.760]   What's more?
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.400]   Having put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.600]   Remember the prayer that we read in Philippians chapter one?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.040]   Great, great prayer.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.960]   Talking about your sincerity and your blamelessness.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.280]   And as you walk with discernment,
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.360]   you're going to be filled with the righteousness.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.760]   What's more?
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.880]   Having shod your feet with the preparation
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.640]   of the gospel of peace.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Okay.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.480]   Wow.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.720]   Think about this.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.240]   You know, when you think about the gospel,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   our atonement, reconciliation,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.360]   our adoption, our redemption, our sanct...
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.760]   You know, like all of these are justification.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.440]   All of these terms, you realize,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.840]   like we could actually prepare and prepare and prepare
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.720]   and think and think and think to appreciate,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.040]   but also hold fast to that truth in even greater ways.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.180]   Right?
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.360]   And my challenge to every single one of us is remember
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.800]   that the gospel is so simple and yet so profoundly deep.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   Yes?
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.880]   And you could take, if the gospel, I'm trying to imagine it.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.320]   I mean, you could take the bird's eye perspective
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.400]   and just be wowed by like,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   the gospel was prepared from ages ago.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.920]   Right?
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.760]   And it's going to come to fruit.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   You can take the gospel and the specificity.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.200]   It's like, look what the sacrifice he had to do.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.600]   And you could take the angle of looking up.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.520]   It's like, look at the perspective of the father.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.360]   You could look down.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.440]   You're like, oh my gosh, look how deep we were.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   Right?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.880]   Like you could look at the gospel
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.480]   in so many different angles and perspectives.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.640]   And then you just realize, wow,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   how profoundly majestic is the mind of God and his love.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.720]   And my question is like, have you,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.600]   and the question here is like, are you prepared with that?
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.520]   Are you prepared with that?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.880]   Now I'm not going to go at length about every single piece
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.040]   because that's something for you to just think through.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.920]   Am I being saturated with truth?
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.580]   Am I continuing to grow in acts of righteousness
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.660]   and discernment?
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.500]   That kind of thing.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.300]   But one thing I do want to tell you is that notice
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.780]   the text is capitalized, which means in your Bible,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.580]   this is a quotation from the old Testament.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.580]   This comes from Isaiah chapter five.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.420]   No, no.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.640]   I'm going to my notes here.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.620]   Oh no, I didn't put it in my notes.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.420]   I want to say, okay, it's from the book of Isaiah.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.740]   I apologize about that.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.980]   I want to say it's Isaiah 11 verse five.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.820]   Okay.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.740]   But what it's talking about, if I remember correctly,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.460]   is I wish I put it in my notes.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.900]   What it's talking about is the nature of the root of Jesse
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.900]   and the branch, the righteous one who is to come.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.860]   Okay.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.220]   That passage was beautiful.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.180]   So I was just like reflecting on it.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.420]   It's talking about the Lord.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.420]   This picture of strength is talking about our Lord.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.540]   And remember the challenge is be strong in the Lord.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.380]   You do realize our Lord is the Lord of truth.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.620]   He is the truth.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.660]   He's the embodiment of the truth.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.860]   He is the King of righteousness.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.260]   He is the Prince of Peace.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.580]   I mean, think about all this.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.380]   You need to be strong in the Lord.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.340]   And I think to me, it's always been such a incredible
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.860]   like source of not like, you got to do this.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.980]   Like he's not a drill sergeant that doing this.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.580]   To me, it has always been such an incredible source
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.620]   of benefit and blessing to us
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.340]   when God wants us to be like his glorious son, Jesus Christ.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.100]   There is such an incredible love of the father
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.580]   when he wants to build you up and change you
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.740]   and transform you into that image
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.420]   of the perfections of Christ, including his strength.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.100]   That's to me always astounding.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.620]   It's awesome.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.380]   I hope that even all the more than motivates you.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.860]   And by way of conclusion,
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.580]   I really, really appreciate Paul's exhortation.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.140]   That is kind of embedded into his statements here.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.100]   That's saying, take up the full armor.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.940]   Repeat it again.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.300]   Take up the full armor.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.140]   Why?
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.180]   Because you need to be able to stand.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.220]   You need to be able to stand.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.260]   And then he says, having done everything to stand firm.
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.180]   And if you notice, I kept reading it funny.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.860]   Like it was supposed to be like this, like run on sentence.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.180]   Like the thought just flows.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.660]   And my point here is going to be,
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.420]   there has to be this mentality where Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.220]   you're supposed to have done all of it.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.300]   And that in and of itself is an incredible challenge
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.700]   because I think a lot of us, there is always,
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.980]   I don't know if it's a laziness, a comfort thing.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.620]   I don't know if it's us seeking shortcuts,
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.140]   wanting it to happen immediately.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.420]   'Cause we are definitely an immediate generation
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.500]   where it has to be microwavable.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   The idea here is, do you have the,
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.860]   I want to do everything mentality.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.260]   And you realize, again,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.340]   using the metaphor of the home defense,
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.300]   you realize it's not enough for you to have,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.700]   let's say you're getting something even more than that.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.460]   Like I'm going to go to machete.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.980]   Do you know where you're going to carry it?
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.860]   You're going to carry that on your body?
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.620]   Do you have a sheet?
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.780]   Do you know how to actually use it?
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.540]   It's like, I'm just going to jab.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.060]   What are you going to do with it?
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.540]   Did you have practice?
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.860]   Do you even know what kind to get?
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.060]   Do you know like what, like, you know,
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.860]   if that's going to endanger your own kids,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.300]   like if you're going to be,
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.220]   you yourself are going to be the greater threat
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.060]   to your own children,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.140]   if you're just wielding something that dangerous.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.220]   I mean, think about this.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.580]   Once you get into the fight, you need all of it.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.740]   And that's the exhortation I want to conclude with.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.140]   Why?
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.940]   Because one of the things that I was meditating upon
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.300]   about myself, you know,
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.340]   there are so many things I want to do.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.980]   And again, there's a balance.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.900]   Sometimes you could be super hard on yourself,
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.660]   but it's a point of conviction for me.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.940]   I think that I have caught myself saying this many times
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.380]   when I know there are so many things
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.020]   that I should be doing, which is,
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:39.480]   I was thinking about it, right?
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.100]   That sounds good.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.300]   I'm very agreeable.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.220]   That's all good.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.500]   I was thinking about it.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.900]   But it was never already done, right?
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.300]   And I think that's one of the issues here
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.340]   with the priorities of God for us
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.180]   in preparation for the hard days to come.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.700]   Every single one of you who've been Christian
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.280]   for more than 10 years, please know,
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.260]   you have probably been at one point on Satan's hit list.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.460]   Because if you've been faithful for this long,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.980]   then he better make sure that he knocks you down, okay?
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.820]   And so many people say,
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.100]   should it be getting easier as you become
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.580]   like aged at the Christian, more mature as a Christian?
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.940]   No, it's probably gonna get harder.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.780]   And our Lord is saying to us,
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.180]   make this a priority to get it done.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.580]   Put on the full armor of God.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.860]   Be ready, amen?
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.680]   Let's pray.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:35.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your love.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.740]   We remember and recall,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.660]   Lord Christ's love for his disciples
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.980]   as he was about to leave.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.540]   We felt his angst.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.180]   We felt his trouble.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.260]   In the passion of his words,
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.960]   he desired to prepare his disciples for his departure.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.460]   And for us, Father God, you have told us,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.480]   you did not leave us.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.180]   You have already given to us the spirit.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.000]   And you're reminding us that you have granted power
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.440]   in the name of Christ.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.900]   And it is my prayer, Lord,
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.300]   that every believer experiences that power in their life
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.020]   starting now.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.500]   Not to think that that's only for a distant, distant future
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.140]   when you return,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.900]   but that we need to be walking with you steadily,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.060]   abiding in you now.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.340]   Lord, right now, there's so many things in the day,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.500]   like the distractions, but also the worries,
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.060]   the unrest, the divisions,
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.620]   and all these things are wearisome, grievous.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.060]   I pray, God, you'd grant to us sobriety of mind,
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.220]   of fortitude, Lord God,
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.980]   where our minds are saturated in your truth,
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.300]   to be able to prove, approve what is godly in your sight,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.300]   so that, Lord, we would both be pleasing to you,
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.780]   but that we would also be able to endure.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.620]   Lord, we wanna thank you.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.220]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:05.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
