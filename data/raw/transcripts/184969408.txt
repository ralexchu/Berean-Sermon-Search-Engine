[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   All right, well it's good to be here and it's good to see some faces, some familiar faces.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.680]   And it really is a pleasure just being able to deliver God's Word to you.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:25.360]   You know, I asked, Pastor Peter asked me a few weeks back now just to speak at the church
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.920]   just because he was going to be gone.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.640]   And you know, I agreed and then I realized I was going to be gone for two weeks for vacation.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.040]   So I asked him, "Hey, can you fill in for me?"
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.760]   And he said, "Oh, I can't say no now."
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.520]   You know, so, so Pastor Peter is going to come and speak for us next week.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240]   And for that, I am grateful and our church is really excited.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:54.440]   Well, we've been, our, at Cross Life, I've been going through the book of Titus and it's
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.080]   almost been a year and we're almost done with chapter three now.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.160]   So, so our congregation is very patient with me.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.440]   But you know, one of the messages I gave was on spiritual disciplines and you know, they
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.720]   told me that they enjoyed it.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.920]   And so I figured, you know, this might be a good message to bring to you guys to bless
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   you.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.160]   So the passage that I'm going to be preaching from is just a single, a single word.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160]   This is why it took so long.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.600]   Okay, so I'm going to preach on a single word today.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.560]   But let's, let's read it in context from verse five to verse nine.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840]   Do you guys stand for the reading of God's word?
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   Do you guys do that?
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   Okay.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   All right.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.080]   Hey, let's stand for the reading of God's word.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.200]   This is what we do at Cross Life.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.240]   I have no idea what, I know what the practice is at, here in Berean.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.560]   Titus chapter one, let's read from verse five to verse nine.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.480]   Titus chapter one, verse five to verse nine.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.060]   This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order and appoint
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.220]   elders in every town as I directed you.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.560]   If anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife and his children are believers and
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.960]   not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.440]   For an overseer as God's steward must be above reproach.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   He must be, he must not be arrogant or quick tempered or drunkard or violent or greedy
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.840]   for gain, hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.120]   He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   and sound doctrine and also rebuke those who contradict it.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.240]   Please join me in prayer.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.080]   Dear God, to think about the fact that the words that we have read proceeds from you
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   is absolutely humbling.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.960]   We are not hearing the mere words of man, but the voice of the triune God, the maker
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.800]   of the heavens and the earth, the redeemer of mankind, the sustainer of this universe,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.400]   the one who will recreate the heavens and the earth.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.760]   This is your word.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.120]   We hear your voice.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.880]   So God, I pray that we would listen to it humbly and that we will give you worship as
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.960]   we think about the truth and meditate upon it and think as to how we can apply it in
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.200]   our lives.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.720]   Help me God to speak clearly and pierce the hearts of the hearers today.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.880]   God, we pray this in Jesus name.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   Amen.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.200]   You may be seated.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.720]   So one of the things that you probably noticed from the context is that the apostle Paul
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.040]   is telling Titus that he has to appoint elders on the island of Crete.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.720]   And he gives a list of qualifications that these men are supposed to fulfill.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.800]   And so what we, the characteristics that we read about here is directly applicable to
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.520]   your pastor, to the elders of the church, but it's still applicable to the rest of the
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.680]   congregation because the congregation is called to imitate the pastor.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.800]   And so there's called to discipline, even though it is directed to the elders of the
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   church, it is still applicable to you.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   And that's what we're going to be talking about.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   Spiritual discipline.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.040]   In his book, Disciplines of Godly Man, Kent Hughes gives a few examples of men who have
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   disciplined their lives for the sake of excellence.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.600]   He says, we wonder at the anatomical perfection of a Da Vinci painting, but we forget that
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.920]   Leonardo Da Vinci on one occasion drew a thousand hands, a thousand hands.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   Thomas Edison came up with the incandescent light after a thousand failures.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.880]   He was also speaks about Churchill and he says, in our own time, Winston Churchill has
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.360]   been rightly proclaimed the speaker of the century and few who have heard his eloquent
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   speeches would disagree.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.040]   Still fewer would suspect that he was anything but a natural.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.760]   But the truth is Churchill had a distracting lisp, which made him the butt of many jokes
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   and resulted in him in his inability to be spontaneous in public speaking.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Yet he became famous for speeches and his seemingly impromptu remarks.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.360]   Actually Churchill wrote everything out and practiced it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.200]   He even choreographed the pauses and pretend fumblings for the right phrase.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.880]   He practiced endlessly in front of mirrors, fashioned his retorts and facial expressions.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   F.E.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.520]   Smith said, Winston has spent the best years of his life writing impromptu speeches.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   I think that's funny.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.560]   You don't write impromptu speeches, you know, just do it impromptu.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.160]   But when we think about the best athletes and the musicians and the experts of specific
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.620]   fields, you got to ask what makes them the best?
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.900]   Maybe natural talent, maybe pure luck, but the common denominator is discipline.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.080]   A person doesn't simply excel in what he sets himself out to do.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.580]   There has to be intentionality.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.420]   A person doesn't just grow automatically.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.060]   I think about many of you probably took piano lessons in middle school.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.820]   Your parents forced you to take it.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.420]   And think about now, how terrible you are.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.700]   How terrible you are at playing the piano because you probably stopped and complained
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.780]   about taking your piano lessons so that you didn't develop your skill over the years.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.100]   You squandered your parents' money.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.980]   That's what I did with my parents' cash.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.620]   I just learned to play some Naruto songs.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.660]   Anyways, skills do not develop automatically.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.300]   It needs to be invested into.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.620]   The reason why this is so important is because we have to get it into our brains that we
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.540]   are not just going to grow as Christians just because we have been a Christian for a long
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.900]   time.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.620]   People think that it happens automatically, that it happens naturally, but that's a lie.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.340]   How many older Christians do you know who are immature in the faith?
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.780]   I know a number of people who have been Christians for years, but instead of becoming more like
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.980]   Jesus Christ, they have become more like the world.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.660]   And when we hear about church splits, when we hear about problems within the church,
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.220]   how many of them are caused by youth groups?
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.100]   They're not caused by youth groups.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.700]   They're caused by the older people in the church.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.500]   Maturity doesn't automatically come with age.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.060]   It doesn't come with the passing of time.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.700]   Godliness is developed by grace through faith expressed in discipline.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.380]   First Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 to 27, it says, "Do you not know that in a race all
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.980]   the runners run, but only one receives a prize?
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.580]   So run that you may obtain it.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.740]   Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.420]   They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   So I do not run aimlessly.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.740]   I do not box as one beating the air, but I discipline my body and keep it under control
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.700]   lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified."
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.100]   Today, as we talk about the quality of discipline, there are several things I do want to address.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.020]   First is the misconception about discipline.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.700]   The misconception about discipline.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.220]   Secondly, the danger of an undisciplined life.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.140]   And lastly, the call to discipline.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.260]   So simple.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.420]   The misconceptions about discipline.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.580]   The danger of an undisciplined life.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.980]   And lastly, the call for discipline.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.460]   Let's get into the misconceptions about discipline.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.060]   The first misconception is the difference between discipline and legalism.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.980]   There are a number of people who look at spiritual disciplines and they shy away from it because
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.860]   they see no difference between discipline and legalism.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.300]   And it might remind them, they might do this because it reminds them of their, I don't
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.740]   know, maybe past church life, where faithfulness was equated with performance.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.020]   The fear of man, pressure was the main motivation to serve in the church.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.620]   And so you might see rules and regulation as a system meant to control you.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.660]   And so you don't like discipline.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.700]   Then there are the people who just love their liberties.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.100]   They just want to do what they want to do.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.300]   And they hide behind Christian liberties and they label anything and everything as legalistic
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.180]   if they don't like it.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.180]   But the reality is this.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.100]   We all live by rules.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.220]   Even though you might not like discipline, you might shy away from it, all of us, we
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.220]   live by rules.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.380]   Even the people who are bent on their freedom, they're all about their Christian liberties,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.900]   live by rules.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.900]   The difference is that these people who don't want to live by rules, they just call the
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.980]   rules that they don't like as being legalistic.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.420]   Isn't that the case?
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.020]   Tell somebody, "Hey, you should read your word.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   Read the Bible.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   Stop being so legalistic."
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.220]   "Hey, I think you're drinking a little bit too much.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.140]   You should stop right there.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.140]   Stop being so legalistic.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.140]   Stop judging me."
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.140]   You hear that.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.140]   You keep going, right?
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.140]   "Hey, don't mess around with your girl.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.140]   You're called to be pure.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.140]   Stop being legalistic."
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.140]   You can say it for anything.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   "Don't murder."
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.140]   Stop being legalistic.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:33.380]   You can say it for anything that you want.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.100]   But the reality is we all live by rules.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.460]   We live by the stipulations.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.380]   The difference between legalism and discipline is the heart.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.700]   Legalism seeks to follow the rules in order to gain merit with God.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.180]   The reason why they follow the things in Scripture is because they want to get the holy points.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.980]   And they think the better that he performed before God, the more God is going to love
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.980]   him.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.420]   And so there's a lot of pride associated with legalism because God loves them more than
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420]   he loves everyone else.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.060]   At least they feel that way.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.740]   They judge everyone else who doesn't measure up to their standard of living.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.060]   But discipline is a matter of following the rules, abiding by the truth revealed in Scripture
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.940]   because of a love for God, a desire to honor him.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.700]   It's not about the actions and the rules in and of itself.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.260]   It's about the heart behind fulfilling those rules.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.540]   So there is a huge difference between discipline and legalism.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:35.340]   The second misconception I want to talk about is discipline and hypocrisy.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.140]   Some people think that unless you do something with a wholehearted desire, then you're not
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.260]   being genuine so that you become a hypocrite.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.220]   I've heard a number of people say, "I just can't read the Word of God because my heart's
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.700]   not into it.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.860]   I don't want to go to church because my heart's not into it and I don't want to be a hypocrite."
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.540]   The Bible says this, in General Myles chapter 17 verse 9, "The heart is deceitful above
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.980]   all things and desperately sick.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.980]   Who can understand it?"
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.060]   The reason why your heart doesn't want to do it, it's not into it, is because your heart's
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.060]   messed up.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.020]   And it would be foolish for you to listen to your heart when your heart is telling you
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.780]   to do something contrary to the will of God.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.420]   And furthermore, doing something when you don't feel like doing it, that's not even
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.620]   hypocrisy.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.380]   We always do things that we don't feel like.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:24.220]   We call it being responsible, not hypocrisy.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.340]   I think about it, who in the world loves waking up at 6 o'clock in the morning?
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.340]   I hate it.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.340]   That's why our service is at 4 o'clock.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.140]   It's at 4 o'clock.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.260]   Unless you have been damaged by the fall deeply, I mean, you don't love waking up at 6 o'clock
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.260]   in the morning.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.260]   You hate it.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.260]   But if you have some responsibility to fulfill, some meeting to attend, you have work to go
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260]   to, what are you going to do?
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.340]   You're going to get up.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   And we don't call that hypocrisy.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.740]   Nobody hears the alarm at 6 o'clock in the morning, "Oh my goodness, I don't want to
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.740]   be a hypocrite.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.900]   I'll wake up when I feel like it."
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.260]   Nobody does that.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.540]   We get ourselves out of bed.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.900]   We do what we are called to do, and that is considered being responsible.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.420]   Yet why does responsibility become hypocrisy when we speak about spiritual matters?
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.140]   Doing something when you don't feel like it does not mean that you are being hypocritical.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.920]   Hypocrisy is when you do something with ulterior motives.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.420]   That's what hypocrisy is.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.340]   A perfect example of hypocrites are the Pharisees.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.340]   Matthew chapter 6, verse 1-4.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.980]   "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.100]   then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.940]   Thus when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.300]   the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.980]   Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.040]   But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.700]   doing so that your giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.700]   you."
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.540]   I mean, see the problems with the Pharisees, they were just like so self-righteous, it
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.700]   was almost, it's funny.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.980]   They sound a trumpet, doo doo doo doo, you know, and then here's your five bucks.
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.780]   And this is the way they lived.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.540]   They did good things, not for the sake of God, but for the sake of their own ego.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:20.220]   So you would be a hypocrite if you use God for anyone else but God.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.180]   It's coming to church because, only because you want to impress that person you like,
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.380]   or it's leading praise because you want to show off your skills so that people can see
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.140]   how wonderful you are on the instrument that you play.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.180]   Or it's being faithful, faithful, and getting involved in all different kinds of ministries,
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.500]   leading different ministries so that people can look up to you, so that you can caress
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.140]   your ego.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.140]   That's hypocrisy.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.500]   But when you discipline yourself to do what is good, holy, and righteous, in spite of
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.500]   what you might feel, it doesn't make you a hypocrite, it makes you responsible, faithful,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.260]   and godly.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.180]   So those are the misconceptions about hypocrisy, misconceptions that you must avoid.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.420]   Now the second thing I want to talk about is the dangers of an undisciplined life.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.380]   The dangers of an undisciplined life.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.180]   Archangel Hughes makes this comment.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:19.740]   He says, "First, in today's world and church, disciplined Christian lives are the exception,
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.500]   not the rule.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:27.100]   This goes for men, women, and the professional clergy."
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.580]   And I agree with Hughes here.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.540]   I know, I was, you know, when I preached this to my congregation, I just looked at them,
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.140]   I go, "This can be true here at Cross Life."
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.540]   I don't know what it's like at Berean.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.180]   But I agree with what Hughes says.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.900]   That a majority of Christians do not live a disciplined life.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   And it's dangerous.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.980]   It's dangerous if you do not live a disciplined life, because you will not be able to handle
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.540]   trials when they come to you, trials that will make you suffer.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.260]   And because you don't have the disciplines to deal with those trials, you will suffer
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.700]   more than you have to.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.980]   And this is dangerous because it might lead you to a place of bitterness.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.380]   It might lead you to a place of despair.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:17.080]   It might even lead you to a place where you run away from God.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.380]   Those who lack discipline will eventually bear the fruit of their neglectful lifestyle.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.380]   Think about boot camp.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.300]   I don't know if there's any military people here.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.860]   I have absolutely no military background.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.700]   I just know what I know from the movies.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.100]   So think about boot camp with me.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.900]   Boot camp is supposed to be physically and psychologically demanding because it's meant
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:47.020]   to prepare soldiers for war, which is psychologically and physically demanding.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.180]   Now imagine a soldier who just skips out on everything.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.580]   He sneaks out of his daily exercise.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.580]   He doesn't train.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.860]   He doesn't learn how to shoot his assault rifle or to cock back his handgun.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.700]   He just doesn't know.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.660]   And he sneaks in all this junk food while everyone is doing what they're doing.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.500]   And he doesn't think it's a big deal because he's getting along just fine.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   Everything's fine.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.860]   He sees everybody running, everybody training.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.100]   He's just hanging out, hiding and eating his potato chips.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.420]   And he's loving life.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.020]   Why make himself suffer more than he has to?
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.420]   But what happens when he's sent to the front lines?
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.500]   He has absolutely no idea what to do.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.180]   He doesn't know how to use his weapon.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.620]   He doesn't have the stamina to keep up with his platoon.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:33.180]   He endangers himself and he endangers other people because of his incompetence.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.300]   He suffers, yes, but he suffers needlessly.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.020]   And worst of all, he doesn't realize that it is his lack of discipline that is the problem.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.860]   He doesn't realize that he's the problem.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.300]   Instead, he ends up blaming the war.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.840]   And for sure, war is the problem, but war is inevitable.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.900]   And so many Christians are like this delinquent soldiers.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.300]   They don't train themselves in season of peace.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.940]   They don't train themselves in times when they are not trying.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.580]   They content themselves with just living a life that just gets by.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.620]   They don't have a healthy diet in the Word of God, but they consume the dribble of this
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.620]   world's entertainment.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.580]   And it's not necessarily things that are immediately bad, but things that will slow them down,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.740]   make them sluggish.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.660]   They don't exercise in the service of prayer so that they have no stamina to maintain a
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.900]   prolonged stance of communion with God.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.580]   And they see no problem with it.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.140]   They see no problem with it.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.980]   They are okay because they get along just fine.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.820]   But then they're thrown into the heat of war.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.020]   You come face to face with the pain of the fall.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.840]   You're bombarded with artillery of life's trouble, and you scurry and you panic, oblivious
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.640]   as to how you should be getting around this problem.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.420]   You suffer more than you have to because you have not developed the disciplines to carry
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.660]   yourself through the struggle.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.940]   But instead of realizing that the problem is your lack of discipline, that your spiritual
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.860]   nonchalance is the reason for your excessive pain.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.180]   You end up blaming things on the things that happen to you.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:58.220]   The anxiety of family problems, pressure, expectations, maybe marital problems, parental
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.580]   problems, the isolation of a post-college life, the loneliness of being single, the
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.460]   drag of work, the difficulty of working with your coworkers, and the difficulty of working
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.940]   with your supervisor, the anxiety of maybe finding a job.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.420]   Whatever the problem might be, when you come across it, you think you're not doing well
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.540]   because you have these problems in your life.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.100]   And it doesn't occur to you that maybe you are the problem.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.140]   Your lack of discipline has cultivated a heart that does not know how to trust God when the
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.500]   trials come.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.900]   Your ignorance of the word of God leaves you clueless as to how you are to navigate through
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.900]   the problem.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.060]   Your failure to meditate upon the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ leaves you in a
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.580]   dark place, even when you suffer.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.540]   Your lack of stamina in prayer leaves you helpless to call upon the powers of heaven
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.500]   when you find yourself behind enemy lines.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.980]   You blame things on all the bad stuff that happened to you.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.300]   You blame things on the war.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.580]   But look, war is inevitable.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.820]   In 1 Peter 4, verse 12, it says, "Beloved, beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.260]   trial when it comes upon you to test you as though something strange were happening to
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.260]   you."
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.800]   Don't be surprised as if this is weird, as if it's off.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.860]   This is normal because when you are a soldier in war, you are going to fight.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.480]   When you are a soldier in war, people are going to hurt you.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.820]   When you are a soldier, you are going to suffer.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.100]   Do not be surprised.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.600]   It's for that reason it's so important for you to realize as a Christian that to be doing
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.740]   well spiritually does not necessarily mean for you to fix the problem, to change the
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.420]   circumstances.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:35.260]   Instead, you must look at your own heart.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.660]   Because what happens if you can't change the problem?
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.700]   Right?
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.860]   What if you can't change it?
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.700]   What if there's nothing for you to do?
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:53.420]   If you doing well is dependent upon the circumstances and the circumstances being changed, the problems
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.540]   being resolved, then you will lose yourself to despair.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.740]   Because what other hope do you have?
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.620]   I've had a number of friends just lose themselves to like depression or bitterness.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.380]   They get so bitter at God because of what life throws at them.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:19.900]   I've even lost a friend to suicide because of the fact that he felt so lost in his struggles.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.420]   So this is not a trivial problem.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.220]   So many Christians take it easy when times aren't pressing.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.380]   They neglect their calling during their boot camps so they lose themselves when the war
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.780]   comes.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.220]   Regardless of the trial, regardless of the suffering, every single Christian is called
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:43.220]   to persevere and to rejoice in the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.020]   Philippians chapter 4 verse 11 to 13, "Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.660]   have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.940]   I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.460]   I have learned the secrets of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.900]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.820]   See, the reason why spiritual disciplines are so important is because it carries you
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.140]   through the fire of spiritual warfare.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.180]   I don't want any of you to suffer more than you have to when the hard times come.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.180]   And trust me, hard times will come.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:22.740]   And I don't want you to be scared off so that you end up picking the path of least resistance.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.980]   Oh, how many Christians do that?
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:31.060]   They pick the path of least resistance instead of choosing the path that most glorifies God
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:37.660]   regardless of whether or not that path is wrought with trials and pain.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.620]   My fear is that many people have become accustomed to a life of laziness and neglect.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.980]   Prayer is done superficially, no depth, no great lengths of communing with God because
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.100]   prayer maybe is not planned for the day.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.820]   You're just pushing off prayer, pushing off prayer, and then late at night you pray, but
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.620]   you're so tired you cut a short, you throw your hands up in the air and say, "At least
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.100]   I tried."
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.380]   Bible reading is done haphazardly.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.420]   You nibble on bits and pieces at the banquet feast of truth.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.900]   You dip your feet in the ocean of divine revelation.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.780]   Sometimes people, the only time they open up the Word of God is on Sundays.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.820]   Meditation is non-existent because it takes time to meditate on such a short passage.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.860]   And we're busy.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.300]   Busy with family, busy with work, busy with school.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.780]   We're a busy, busy people.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.220]   There's no reflection and examining weaknesses because we've got along just fine with the
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   weaknesses that we have.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.040]   Can't be that bad, right?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.300]   There's no search for accountability because, again, we're a busy people.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.660]   No mortification of sin, no checks.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.660]   Why?
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.500]   Because we've had a long day and fighting sin is hard.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.140]   Who wants to be tired?
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.820]   There are too many Christians who have no regular discipline in their life.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.500]   They have a blasé attitude when it comes down to the spiritual things.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:56.140]   No intensity, no resolve, no fire, no will, no resolution.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.180]   And I feel like it's okay right now when things are easy, when there are no problems, but
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:06.900]   you will realize that it is not okay when the trials come into your life.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.900]   Difficulties will come.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.300]   It's just a matter of when.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.820]   My hope is that my brothers and sisters will prepare themselves when that time does come.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:23.060]   And so we come to the call for discipline.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.660]   I want to exhort you guys to discipline your lives.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:30.060]   See, our hearts are naturally wired to rebel against God.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.780]   We predispose to the things of sin.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:37.300]   The Adamic curse has affected us totally.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.380]   It affected the totality of our soul.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.540]   We are inclined to overlook the beauty of the cross.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.580]   We're inclined to forget about the blood that washed away our sins.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.260]   We're inclined to run away from the one who loved us by giving up everything for us.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.340]   And unless we buffet our body, we beat our flesh into submission, sin will entice, sin
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.540]   will manipulate us.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.940]   Pastor Steve Lawson gives this definition of discipline.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:06.020]   He says, "Self-discipline means the exercise of power over oneself.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.340]   It is the ability to keep oneself under control.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   The word indicates self-mastery over one's inner desire, thoughts, actions, and word.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.580]   It is the control a believer must exercise over his life."
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.700]   The Bible likens spiritual discipline to athletic training.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.940]   First Timothy chapter four, verse seven, "Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.860]   Rather train yourself for godliness."
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.980]   In Hebrews chapter 12, verse one, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.740]   of witness, let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.340]   run with endurance the race that is set before us."
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.780]   Every professional athlete beats his body into submission.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.340]   He trims his fat, he increases his muscle, he increases his stamina, he refines his strength,
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.740]   he eliminates his weaknesses, he watches his intakes, and cares more about the nutrients
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.740]   rather than the taste.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.060]   And there's a massive exertion of energy and pinpointed precision in directing that
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.100]   energy to refine his skills.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.580]   And when the competition comes, when the competition comes, the time of testing comes, he performs
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.580]   at his peak.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.020]   And he accomplishes feats that seem humanly impossible.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:15.260]   And this is the calling of the Christian, trimming off the things that slow you down
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.380]   from pursuing the things of God.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.000]   Not things that are necessarily sinful, but things that slow you down.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.860]   We have a lot of things that slow us down.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.300]   Strengthening your stamina in prayer, increasing your knowledge of scripture, strengthening
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.420]   your resolve against sin, committing yourself to service.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.780]   Just as an athlete disciplines his body, so every Christian is called to discipline their
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.660]   soul.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:45.180]   Now before you all are convicted to start a Bible reading program or read articles on
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.580]   prayer, it's very important for you to focus on the goal.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.980]   It's very, it's imperative for you to focus on the purpose for why you discipline your
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980]   life.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.460]   Remember the difference between legalism and discipline is the heart.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.100]   That is the difference.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.780]   The heart behind discipline does not seek to elevate the self, it seeks to elevate God.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.300]   It seeks to bring pleasure to the Lord.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.100]   In 1 Corinthians 9 24 to 27 it says, "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run,
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.020]   but only one receives a prize?
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.720]   So run that you may obtain it."
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.380]   Every athlete exercises self-control in all things.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.860]   They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we are imperishable.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.820]   So I do not run aimlessly, I do not box as one beating the air, but I discipline my body,
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:34.220]   keep it under control, as after preaching to others I myself should not be disqualified.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.220]   So what is Paul saying?
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.780]   I'm running with a goal in mind.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.900]   I'm running for the imperishable wreath.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.460]   I'm running towards the finish line where my God is waiting for me, where my Savior
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   is waiting for me.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.300]   So I have a goal, a finish line, a purpose in mind.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.480]   And if that goal is not there, your discipline is going to mutate into legalism or it's going
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.040]   to dissipate into nothingness.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.600]   You know, one of the things I hate doing is running.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.000]   I hate it.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.160]   People tell me about a runner's high.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.680]   I've never experienced it in my life.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.080]   It's perpetually low for me, you know.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:15.540]   It's agonizing and my hatred for running is compounded when I have to run in laps, you
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.280]   know, run through laps, because I'm literally running in circles.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   But you add something to this.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.360]   You add a ball and a basket and I can run.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   I'm like a dog, right?
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.640]   You just give me something and I can run.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:36.540]   It's not because the pain disappears, but because the goal eclipses the pain.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.760]   The goal makes all the difference, even if it's as primitive as putting a ball inside
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   of a basket.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.960]   Now, I don't in any way want to imply that I'm good at basketball.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   I'm actually pretty bad.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.760]   It's a waste of height, you know.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   But, yeah, I mean, I enjoy playing regardless.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.720]   Anyways, let's, let's, let me see my point.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.760]   I want us to reflect upon the activity of basketball.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.720]   Just putting a ball inside of a basket within the vastness of this universe, the complexity
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:15.960]   of nature and the mysteries of this world, putting a ball inside of a basket is enough.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.400]   It is enough to engage us.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   And it's primitive, right?
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   It is elementary.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:27.240]   Yet that purpose has become so elevated that it consumes the lives of the greatest athletes.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.760]   The best of athletes, they train their bodies, they lift weights, spend hours at the gym
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.480]   just to fulfill that goal.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.960]   Think about that.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.860]   When you take a step back, it's pretty ludicrous, right?
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.860]   But that's what they do.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.840]   They commit their lives for this.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.040]   The complex movements are created.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.400]   Finesse is refined.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   Plays are planned.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   Strength is developed.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   Coordination is sharpened.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.120]   All to put a ball inside of a basket.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.880]   So I watch these guys, they're good.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.240]   They just, boom, they cross over, right?
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   They do a spin move.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.820]   They cut through two defenders and with a burst of energy, they rise as if they're reaching
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.820]   for the sky.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.340]   All to put a ball inside of a basket.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:11.700]   Or they, you know, it's the fourth quarter, the game is tight, the clock is counting down.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.740]   You take your ball from half court and you throw it into the air.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.420]   And to your disbelief, you see the most glorious sight you have ever seen.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.380]   You see that ball go inside that basket.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.380]   And then you're like, "Ahhhh."
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.980]   I mean, you see full grown men going, "Ahhhh."
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   All right?
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.980]   I mean, full grown men.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.260]   It's not like they found a cure for some deadly disease or ventured into the deep space.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.020]   They put a ball inside a basket and they're like, "Ahhhh."
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.020]   They're rejoicing.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.020]   They're rejoicing.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.020]   That's enough.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   That is enough.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.660]   Now, if a goal as simple as this is enough to merit national attention and call forth
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.140]   men and women to lay down their energy, their money, and their resources, their lives for
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.860]   this purpose, how much more passion should consume a believer whose goal far surpasses
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.700]   that of putting a ball inside of a basket?
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.300]   The goal of their glory that will be shared in Christ.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.820]   The goal of their resurrection from the dead.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.300]   The witness of the recreation of the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.660]   The realization of divine righteousness and the damnation of the devil.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.260]   The eradication of sin.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.620]   Their reign with the king of kings and their fellowship with the Savior who laid down everything
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.340]   so that they might have everything.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.300]   It is for this goal and for this purpose why we as Christians, we discipline our bodies.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.680]   We buffet our bodies.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.740]   We make it our slaves.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.940]   We discipline ourselves in the reading and the meditation of the word.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.540]   We discipline ourselves in prayer.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.480]   We discipline ourselves in evangelism.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.780]   We discipline ourselves in the service of the church.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.540]   We discipline our lives in all aspects for the sake of this goal.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.860]   Strengthening weaknesses.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.460]   Eliminating weaknesses.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.780]   Honing our skills.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.780]   Working for God.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.460]   Waiting for the day when we will see our Savior face to face.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.500]   When we see the new Jerusalem descend from heaven.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.860]   When we will see the new heavens and the new earth created.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.380]   When we hear the voice of our Savior, the voice of our Master, well done good and faithful
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   servant.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.340]   Enter into the rest of your master.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.600]   That's our goal.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.940]   That's our purpose.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.180]   God has given you one life and he has redeemed that life through the blood of his own Son.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.740]   He does not expect you to squander it upon yourself but upon his glory.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.980]   Second Peter chapter 10 verse 13.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.620]   "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief and the heavens will pass away with
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.100]   war and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved and the earth and the works
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.380]   that are done on it will be exposed.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.980]   Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people are you to be in lives
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.060]   of holiness and godliness?
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.660]   Waiting for hastening the coming of the day of God because which of the heavens will be
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.500]   set on fire and dissolved and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:46.180]   But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.180]   dwell.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:52.100]   We are waiting, we're hoping, anticipating.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   This is what we live for.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:06.620]   Now, um, brothers and sisters, it's um, I have, I have no idea how your spiritual state
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:12.000]   this might, I might be just preaching to the choir here and uh, knowing this, this wonderful
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.700]   ministry and what Pastor Peter has been doing along with Pastor Mark and the elders here,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:21.980]   it's uh, I'm confident that there are many of you faithfully fighting and persevering
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.140]   through the trials of life and, and committing your life for the things of God.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:32.820]   But I'm also confident that there are some of you here who are struggling, who have not
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:38.900]   committed your life to live for the Lord, even though you professed him as your savior.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:48.580]   And I do want to exhort you guys to think, think beyond what lies tomorrow, project your
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.240]   sight to eternity future and what will come and live for that moment when you will see
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   your savior.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.140]   And I promise you, you will not regret it.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:04.780]   Um, I do want to give you guys some resources.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.020]   This is all new to you.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.780]   There are some good books out there and uh, one book that was very helpful to me is Disciplines
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.740]   of a Godly Man by Kent Hughes.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.300]   You see, I quoted him several times.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:19.820]   There's also a one by his wife called Disciplines of a Godly Woman by Barbara Hughes.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.340]   I read portions of that.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.780]   It's a, it's at the Pre-Titus too, which talks about women, discipling women and stuff.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.540]   So I was reading all these women books.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.900]   Um, I found out at the end of the day, they teach the same Bible, right?
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.700]   And they just say the same thing, but they just, anyways, not exactly the same thing,
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.860]   but anyways, this is a good book.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.900]   I would recommend it.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.700]   There's also a good book called Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life by Donald
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.700]   Whitney.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700]   That is excellent work.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:46.300]   And uh, Spiritual Disciplines for Christians, for Christian Life, for the Christian Life
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.180]   by Donald Whitney.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.500]   And I'm sure you can find a number of articles that will help.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:57.300]   But you know, the practice of Christian discipline doesn't have to be crazy unless you really
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.540]   want to go buck wild.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.700]   Uh, I think it's good to set a realistic goal that you can practice, practice regularly.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.500]   Uh, we know one thing I say is try to spend 15 minutes with the Lord.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.420]   Let's just start there.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.420]   Five minutes in prayer.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.060]   I want to five minutes in the word, you know, read, read the word and then five minutes
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.060]   meditating.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.060]   That's not a long time.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.380]   And then five minutes in prayer.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.940]   And when you meditate, think about what you read.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.160]   Think about its implications.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.660]   Think about the ways in which you can apply it.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.740]   Sometimes I feel like guys get really excited in the beginning and they make all these lofty
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.020]   goals and aren't able to sustain that level of commitment and commitment.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.580]   They get discouraged and they chuck everything out the door.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.060]   It's like reading the Bible one year, right?
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   Most people die at Leviticus.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.060]   It's like the desert.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.460]   They're trying to, you know, wander through that.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.260]   Oh my goodness, I need the water of life.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.460]   You know, it's just, uh, and it's, you know, so people get discouraged.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.180]   They stop and then they start over again in Genesis thinking they could do it and they
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.220]   die in the same place, you know?
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.780]   Um, so I mean, if that's hard, just read the New Testament.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.100]   Just start there.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.100]   Start small.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.340]   Develop a habit in doing all this stuff so that when there comes a day where you don't
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.260]   do it, you feel like there's something off because you've been so regular in spending
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.260]   time with the Lord.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:19.700]   Um, you know, R. Kent Hughes, he, uh, he gives a story of a man named William Harrison.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:27.180]   He says, "Lieutenant General William K. Harrison was the most decorated soldier in the 30th
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.740]   Infantry Division, rated by General Eisenhower as the number one infantry division in World
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.460]   War II.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.340]   General Harrison was the first American to enter Belgium, which he did at the head of
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.820]   the Allied Forces.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.340]   He received every decoration for valor except the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.020]   Being honored with the distinguished Silver Cross, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.940]   valor, and the Purple Heart, he was one of the few generals to be wounded in action.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.900]   When the Korean War began, he served as Chief of Staff in the United Nations Command, and
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.380]   because of his character and self-control, was ultimately President Eisenhower's choice
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.660]   to head the long and tedious negotiations to end the war.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.420]   General Harrison was a soldier's soldier who led a busy, ultra-kinetic life, but he was
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.780]   also an amazing man of the word.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.440]   When he was a 20-year-old West Point cadet, he began reading the Old Testament through
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.620]   once a year and the New Testament four times.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.220]   General Harrison did this until the end of his life.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.440]   Even in the thick of war, he maintained his commitment by catching up during the two
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.220]   and three day respites for replacement and refitting, which followed battles, so that
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.820]   when the war ended, he was right on schedule.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.540]   When at the age of 90, his failing eyesight no longer permitted his discipline, he had
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.300]   read the Old Testament 70 times and the New Testament 280 times.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:48.860]   Man, I read that, I'm convicted.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.900]   So often we say, "Man, we're busy."
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.660]   But this guy's saying, "Hey, people are trying to kill me."
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.140]   And he's still reading the Word of God.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.140]   Why?
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.620]   Because he understands how precious it is.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.500]   He understands how precious it is to hear the voice of his God.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.940]   That's what he understands.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.780]   And this is why we discipline our lives, because we want to spend time with our God.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.660]   We want to spend time with our Savior.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.260]   This is not a legalistic call for you to start doing things and marking things off, checking
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.900]   boxes in your reading, spending a certain quota of time in prayer.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.820]   This is spending time with the one whom you love, the one who loved you by sending his
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.340]   son to die for you.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:34.220]   So the calling is strong, and I pray that you answer that call by spending time with
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.340]   your Lord and your Savior, disciplining your life, living for him.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.020]   Let us pray.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.500]   Dear God, you are worthy.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.940]   You are worthy of our lives.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:38:00.620]   And you are worthy because you have created the heavens and the earth, that you sustain
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:05.900]   this universe, and you are worthy because you have redeemed us and saved us through
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.660]   the blood of your Son and through the power of his resurrection.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.780]   God, we belong to you.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.500]   We were created and then recreated to live for your glory.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:23.340]   And I pray for my brothers and sisters here, my friends at Berean, that you would help
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.760]   them to continue living a life of discipline for those who are faithfully loving you and
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.740]   enjoying you.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:34.340]   And that for those that are not, that you would convict them and help them to understand
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:41.020]   the severity of their neglect, and that they would answer the call to love you.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.420]   Lord, the greatest command is to love you with all our hearts, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.220]   Would your grace be upon all of us, that we may fulfill that command.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.180]   Lord, we pray this all in the name of your Son, our Lord and Savior, our King, Jesus
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.180]   the Christ.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.180]   Amen.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.180]   Amen.
