[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 12, I'm going to read
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:16.160]   from verse 3 to 8 again, and this is sort of a continuation of last week's sermon.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.600]   Romans chapter 12, verses 3 to 8, reading the ESV, "For by the grace given to me, I
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.900]   say to everyone among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.400]   but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.120]   For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.640]   so we though many are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them, if prophecy
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.000]   in proportion to our faith, if service in serving the one who teaches in his teaching,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.840]   the one who exhorts in his exhortation, the one who contributes in generosity, the one
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.960]   who leads with zeal, the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness."
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.240]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.040]   Gracious and holy Father, we thank you so much for today, and as we've been studying
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.880]   justification and the sacrifice of Christ and how that restored our relationship with
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.000]   you, and as we continue to dive into our work of sanctification, how you've placed us
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.660]   in the body of Christ, that we may use our gifts to build it up, Lord God, for the sake
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.360]   of your kingdom.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.400]   I pray for wisdom.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.600]   I pray, Father God, for the power of your word to make a deep impression in our mind
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.760]   and heart that we would move, that we would be more than just hearers, but doers of your
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760]   word.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   We thank you, Jesus, and we pray.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.520]   Amen.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.360]   You know, typically, when we look for a church that we want to get plugged in, and I know
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.280]   some of you guys have been here for a while, some of you guys are just making your way
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.760]   in, one of the key things that most people look for are, when they come into a church,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.560]   are there people like me at this church?
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   Do they look like me?
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.320]   Are they in my age category?
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.240]   Are they, do they have similar backgrounds?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.840]   Are these people that I can share my life with?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.240]   And it's understandable, because we want to be able to relate.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.000]   Community is extremely important.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   But one of the beauty of the body of Christ, of the church, is that if you look at the
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.080]   early church, they didn't have two separate churches where if you speak Greek, you're
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.000]   in part of this church, and if you speak, spoke Hebrew, you're part of this other church.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   If you happen to be slave owners, you are part of this church, and if you happen to
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.940]   be slaves, you're part of another church.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.440]   If you were a Gentile, you're part of this church, and you're Hebrew, you're part of
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.600]   the other church.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.420]   The early church didn't have these options.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.680]   They got together, and they were all part of one particular church.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.040]   So you can imagine the kind of problems, spiritually speaking, socially speaking, that they must
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   have had.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.460]   So imagine having a former slave that you, maybe you were the master, and they're sitting
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.800]   in the same congregation, and sometimes they were the ones who were leading the church.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.560]   You had a Pharisee who studied the Bible, knew all the nuances of the Old Testament
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.520]   law, and he's sitting there learning under a guy who spent most of his life cheating
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.160]   his own people, these tax collectors of money from the business that they were running.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   Humanly speaking with them, well, that's disaster.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   I mean, people who just maybe a few months or years ago hated each other, were eager
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   to just end each other's lives, all of a sudden sitting together and calling God their Lord
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   and brothers and sisters in Christ, sharing things, selling property and giving it to
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.920]   one another so that they can support one another.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.880]   And so if you look at the early church, humanly speaking, the formula would have been, should
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.520]   have been, disaster.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   And in some cases, a lot of these things that you would expect, a lot of the problems that
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.960]   you would expect in the early church, we see it in the letters.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.640]   In fact, James, if you've ever studied through the epistle of James, one of the primary things
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.320]   that James addresses in the book of James is this division between the rich and the
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.800]   poor, where the rich people who were honored in the society when they were coming into
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.080]   church, the people who didn't have the money were putting them in honorable seats and looking
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.820]   to them and coveting what they had.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.440]   And so if you read the book of James carefully, the underlying theme of that is this prejudice
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.400]   for or against rich or poor people.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.240]   So clearly we saw that in the early church, they had these issues.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.120]   The book of Galatians is written because of the difficulty they had with the former Jews
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.580]   who converted, the Judaizers who couldn't let go of their culture.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.240]   And also the Greeks who became a Christian came in and they had their own baggage, where
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.360]   they came from idol worshiping and they knew nothing of the law.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.840]   And all of a sudden they come together and they were calling each other brothers and
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   sisters in Christ.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.280]   And the Galatians deal with that issue.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   And so again, they're dealing with the issue of the true gospel.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.400]   But again, the problem that they had in the early church was this mixture of the Jewish
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.080]   and the Gentiles coming together, where for centuries they wouldn't even sit in each other's
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   homes.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.880]   They wouldn't walk on the same roads, let alone eat together and call each other brothers
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   and sisters in Christ.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:30.640]   Philemon is a letter written to a former slave owner, introducing the runaway slave
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.960]   back to his former master, now as a brother in Christ.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.480]   So the early church had all kinds of issues because of that.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   So humanly speaking, we would say maybe it would have been wiser.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.320]   I mean, that could have been predictable.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.000]   All of these issues that the early church had, it could have been easily predictable
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.780]   if we just had different churches.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.160]   We had one church for this group, one church for that group, which in a lot of ways, that's
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.700]   what our churches today look like.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.240]   As soon as it becomes uncomfortable in a certain neighborhood, you pack up your stuff and go
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   to a neighborhood where it's safer.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.800]   And then again, even the way that we choose churches, we go in to see, are there people
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.440]   like me?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.960]   People that I would be friends with, people that I want to live with, people I want to
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.080]   take trips with.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.920]   Are those people in this church?
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.500]   And then if we don't see them automatically, maybe God's not calling me here.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.040]   But God in his wisdom deliberately placed us together.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.760]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 1, 10 through 14, it says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.040]   name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.560]   you, but that you be united with the same judgment.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.880]   For it has been reported to me by close people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers."
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   What I mean is that each one of you says, "I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.560]   Cephas, or I follow Christ."
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.760]   Is Christ divided?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.640]   Was Paul crucified for you?
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.280]   Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.940]   So two of Paul's longest letters, 1 and 2 Corinthians, is addressing this issue that
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.200]   he just states in 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   This issue of immorality in the church, issue of chaos in worship, even communion.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.820]   The rich people were coming and they were eating and taking part in the communion bread
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.620]   and then they would completely ignore the poor people.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.600]   And so Paul rebukes them in 1 Corinthians 11 saying, "Is Christ divided?
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   What you are doing is not the Lord's table."
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   So this division in the church led to all kinds of chaos that Paul addresses in 1 Corinthians
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.800]   and 2 Corinthians.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.920]   But the root problem of it was this division in the church.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   And it wasn't a division between worldliness and godliness.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   It was a division between who they preferred to follow.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.520]   We see that in Philemon, Philippians chapter 4, 2-3.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.440]   There's a church that Paul calls a model church.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.760]   A church that he would put on a pedestal and say, "This is what we ought to shoot for."
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:04.000]   This is one of those churches in Macedonia that begged Paul in his letter that despite
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   their own famine, despite the problem that they had financially, they begged Paul to
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.200]   give them an opportunity to serve God and give money.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.640]   Paul actually said, "No, you take care of yourself."
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.320]   And he says, "They begged him."
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.960]   So this is that church.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.440]   The Philippian church.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.360]   The model church.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.960]   And yet, they had a problem with these two prominent ladies, Euda and Sintich.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.640]   In Philippians chapter 4, 2-3, it says, "I entreat you, Euda, and I entreat you."
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.560]   In other words, he's begging them to agree in the Lord.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.940]   "Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women who have labored side by side
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.840]   with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.520]   are in the book of life."
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.640]   This was causing so much chaos and problem in the early church.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.800]   Paul actually begs them and he asks other people to get involved to help them.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.880]   Titus chapter 3, 10, it says, "As for a person who stirs up division, after warning
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.600]   him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him."
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.280]   So this idea of unity in the church was so important that Paul actually says to treat
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.000]   him like an unbeliever if he is deliberately trying to divide the church.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.480]   And then his harshest criticism in 1 Corinthians 3, 16-17, he says, "Do you not know that
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.080]   you are God's temple?"
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.240]   And the word "you" here is in the plural.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.840]   So he's not talking about "you" as in singular "us."
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.680]   He later says this, uses the singular form in chapter 6.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.240]   But here, the "you" is in the plural, referring to the church as a whole.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.640]   He's saying, "Do you not know?
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.200]   Do you not know that the church is the temple of God and God's spirit dwells in you?"
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.880]   Again in plural.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.720]   If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him for God's temple is holy and
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.360]   you are that temple.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.840]   So what specific problem is he referring to?
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.480]   Is this division that he mentioned in chapter 1.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.280]   And the ramification of that, that he will again continue to exposit throughout the rest
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.960]   of 1 and 2 Corinthians.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.600]   We could have predicted, humanly speaking, that they were going to have problems.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.080]   Of course, you put a tax collector as one of the apostles and you get these, you get,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.320]   you know, that former Pharisees and Sadducees sitting there, converted, learning from them.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.380]   You could have easily predicted there was going to be issues there.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.340]   You put a former slave owner and a runaway slave into the same church calling each other
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.840]   brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.600]   At some point, their flesh is going to get involved and you could have predicted there
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   was going to be a problem.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.440]   Understandably, the Jews and the Greeks coming together, I mean, these are people who hated
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.720]   each other, wouldn't even go through, walk through each other's towns and they're together.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.480]   They're going to each other's houses.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.640]   They're selling their property, giving to each other.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.920]   At some point, you could have predicted that there was going to be some kind of division
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.080]   in the church and we see that in the early church because almost every single letter
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.380]   written in the early church addresses this issue of division in the church.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.480]   But here's the thing.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.220]   It was not a mistake.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.100]   It wasn't because they didn't have options.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:18.640]   God places us together in the body of Christ because in order to reflect His kingdom, it
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.560]   is a vital part of our sanctification that God has placed us where we are deliberately.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   This morning, I want to address the three issues that I believe that the imagery of
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.080]   the body of Christ.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   It teaches us about true unity, what God desires of us.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.620]   So I'm going to call it the BLTs for you to have an easier time remembering.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.640]   Not bacon, lettuce, and tomato, but belief, love, and task.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.680]   Belief, love, and task.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:55.840]   True unity in the church requires unity in belief, unity in love, and unity in task.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.320]   First service, I didn't get to the third part, so I may not.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.040]   I'm predicting that I'm not going to get to the third part, but at least for the first
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.480]   two, belief, love, and task.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.280]   First of all, belief.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:18.040]   What unites us first and foremost is not uniformity, meaning we walk in, they look like my age,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.160]   similar socioeconomic background, maybe same college, you know.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.000]   We have similar kids, in similar age, and say, "Okay, now I can run the race with these
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   people."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.720]   That's not what unites the church, because if that was the case, the early church would
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.520]   have looked very different.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.720]   What unites the church is what we believe, and that's the beauty of the church.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.840]   That on the surface, we may look at it and say, "Why would these people spend any time
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   together?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.000]   There's a bunch of people at church I would never interact with if it wasn't for Christ."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.080]   And I think if you look at the early church, it gives us a glimpse of the priority in the
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   church.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.120]   If you look at Acts 6, verse 1, it is the first church-wide problem that they have.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.760]   When the church began to grow, they started having this issue, and it says in Acts 6,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.160]   verse 1, "Now in those days when the disciples were increasing in number," and again, I think
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.680]   any church, when the church increases, it kind of exposes the weaknesses of the church.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   And so what happened was, in these days, when the church was increasing, "a complaint by
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.480]   the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   distribution."
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.000]   Now, just to kind of give you a background, the Hellenists were also Jews, but Hellenists
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.200]   were people who integrated into the Greek culture.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.600]   So whether they were second or third or fourth generation, they spoke Greek as their primary
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.840]   language.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.720]   Even though they're Hebrews by heritage, but by culture and by language, they were Hellenists,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.440]   they were Greeks.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.360]   So they were considered kind of like compromisers by the Hebrews, because the Hebrews are the
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.080]   ones who retained their heritage.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.600]   They're the ones who were probably very active in the synagogues.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.680]   They were the ones who probably went to the temple during Passover, and they primarily
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.880]   spoke Aramaic.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.220]   So you had people who genetically came from the same heritage, but you had a distinction
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.880]   in the early church, because these are the first groups of people that came to faith.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.440]   First, the Hebrews, and then they were closely connected to the Hellenists.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.400]   So what happened was, when the church was increasing in large number, the initial group
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.240]   who converted were probably the Hebrews, those who spoke Aramaic, because the gospel started
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:44.520]   in those areas where it was saturated by Hebrews, not Hellenists.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.840]   So when they first converted and came in, you have to understand that this problem that
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.920]   they're dealing with was not a small problem.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.400]   There was a division in the church within the two, and they were probably considered
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.520]   lesser Jews, because they compromised.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.560]   They became Hellenists.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.000]   They integrated into the culture.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.960]   It's kind of like when King Cyrus allowed Israel to come back into Jerusalem, a few
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.040]   of them, a remnant came back to Jerusalem to build a temple, and the rest of them stayed
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.280]   in Persia, because they integrated.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.540]   So that's how the Hellenists were looked upon.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.220]   They were compromisers.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.920]   And yet they converted, they come in, and when they said that the Hellenist widows were
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.320]   being neglected in the daily distribution of food, basically they weren't eating.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.360]   It wasn't like they weren't getting coupons to get boba.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.320]   It wasn't something insignificant like that.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   They weren't eating.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.560]   So this was a legitimate problem, these widows, and if the church didn't feed them, they
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.440]   had nowhere to go.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.020]   So if they didn't deal with this problem, it could have completely split the church.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.240]   They could have had the Hellenists rise up and say, "Hey, if we don't deal with this
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.360]   and our widows are not being taken care of, we're going to do it ourselves," and they
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.080]   might have just taken up, and immediately the first church would have been divided into
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.880]   two.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.240]   Instead, the disciples, and you can see the way that they deal with this problem, they
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.560]   said, "It is not right for us to neglect the preaching of the word and prayer in order
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.920]   to serve tables."
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.400]   Now, the apostles were not saying that because they're apostles and leaders that serving
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   is beneath them.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.280]   That's not what they're saying at all.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.120]   In fact, Jesus teaches exactly the opposite.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.360]   He who is greatest in the kingdom is the one who serves.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.000]   So they're not saying that if you're a leader in the church that you shouldn't be serving,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.060]   it's beneath them.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:42.080]   The emphasis here is the neglecting of preaching and prayer, the priority of the word of God.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.320]   Because what brought them together in the first place was the preaching of the gospel
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.960]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.600]   And if that gets neglected, you may have uniformity, you may have superficial unity, you may feed
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.360]   them and everybody might be happy, but there's no true unity.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.440]   Because true unity, what brings us together from different backgrounds, different culture,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   different economic status, and even different spiritual maturity is our connection to Christ.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.480]   In Ephesians 4, 11, 13, it says, "And he gave the apostles, the prophets, evangelists, pastors,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.840]   and teachers to equip the saints for the work of the ministry, for building up of the body
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.240]   of Christ, until we all attain the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.980]   God, to a mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.060]   If you notice the office of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, every
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:41.540]   single one of them, their primary responsibility was to disseminate the word of God.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:47.020]   And so he says they need to do their job to equip the saints for what?
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.300]   For the unity, that we may come to the unity of the faith in the knowledge of the Son of
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.800]   God.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.860]   What unites us is our individual connection to Christ.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.340]   And again, Ephesians 1, 22, "And God placed all things under his feet, appointed him to
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.480]   be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.080]   everything in every way."
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.980]   When our unity in the church is superficial, meaning that these are people that I like,
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.040]   or I get along with these people, these people, you know, happen to have these qualities,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.800]   and these people like to go ice skating, these go mountain climbing, these are Angels fans,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.580]   these are Dodgers fans.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.540]   Human relationships are so fickle.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.180]   I mean, it is so fickle.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.960]   There's one thing that I've learned throughout the years, is just human relationships are
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   unstable.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.140]   It is absolutely unstable.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.740]   I mean, I've seen best friends sever their friendship because they're getting married
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.660]   and they can only have one maid of honor or one best man, and they would choose one over
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.340]   the other, and then the other person doesn't get along, and then they're dead, they're
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.820]   done.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.820]   They just couldn't get over it.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.700]   I mean, that's how fickle it is.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.540]   One misunderstanding.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.620]   Something happens, you did something, they didn't understand it, and it doesn't get
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.200]   reconciled, the end.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:14.540]   If our unity in the church is based upon something superficial as human connection, it's just
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.580]   a matter of time, something happens.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.620]   You don't like somebody, I mean, sometimes you like them and sometimes you don't like
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.620]   them, you get along with these people now, but then next year you don't get along with
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.900]   them.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:33.020]   But the unity of the church ultimately is not based upon our friendship, who we get
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.620]   along and who we don't get along with, who are people who are like me that I want to
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.220]   go camping with these people and I would love to be a part of this church for that purpose.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:48.580]   It is when we are vitally connected to Christ that I may have nothing with you in common
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.540]   in the world, but as soon as we begin to talk about Christ, as soon as we begin to pursue
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.780]   Christ, I can have fellowship with a 19-year-old or a 70-year-old because we're talking about
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.860]   the same thing, we're pursuing the same thing.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.660]   Our unity is not based upon something superficial.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.300]   And again, sad to say, even in the way that we talk about how to produce church, if you
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.980]   want to tap into how people come to church, give them something that they can latch onto,
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.460]   and that's sort of using human wisdom to bring people to the church.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.940]   But how superficial.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:30.280]   But the kingdom of God does not look anything like the world because what binds us together
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.580]   is Christ and Christ alone.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.860]   That's why the very first part of our church covenant, of the 10 covenants that we have,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:42.940]   is that each member has to be a confessing believer of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.620]   And that our unity comes in the context of pursuing Christ together.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.220]   If our frustration is we're not united, I don't feel connected with these people, why
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:56.180]   we're not passionately pursuing Christ, the problem is not the people.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   The problem is that what unites us doesn't interest us.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.660]   And so we're looking for something superficial to connect with.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.180]   First and foremost, the church, what connects us is our connection to Christ.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.220]   Secondly, what connects us is love.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.060]   Is love.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:22.460]   Under the banner of understanding of love, I mean of belief, that this is who we are
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.260]   and this is who we pursue, the second understanding, even though Paul doesn't mention the word
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.140]   love in this text, it's understood.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:37.640]   Because in Ephesians 5.29, Paul says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.020]   and cherishes it just as Christ does the church."
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.780]   And he uses the illustration of husband and wife.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:49.900]   As Christ loved the church, he says the husband is called to love his wife and he says he's
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.900]   part of your own body and nobody hates his own body.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:59.420]   It's assumed that if you understand that this is your body, that you are to love it.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.700]   In fact, Jesus himself says the greatest commandment is love God and second is like it, to love
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.180]   your neighbors as what?
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.180]   As yourself.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.180]   It is assumed.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.900]   It is assumed that you spend a lot of time loving yourself, which we do.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.500]   Whether you have high esteem or low esteem, you have high esteem because you love yourself
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.900]   too much.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.700]   And you also have low esteem because you love yourself too much.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.480]   It's understood that we love ourselves.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.060]   We spend all of our time, first and foremost, taking care of ourselves.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.980]   So when he says to love your neighbor as yourself, it's assumed.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.260]   So when he says that we are one, you are part of this body, this is your body, it is assumed
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:43.460]   that there is a love that we are to practice with one another.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.900]   See 1 Corinthians 12, 18-26, it says, "As it is, God arranged the members in the body,
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.140]   each one of them as he chose."
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.580]   Again, let that sink in.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.300]   You know, we may think that, well, if we want to really keep the unity, if everybody had
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:08.100]   the exact same gift, maybe we wouldn't have this coveting or this competition or misunderstanding.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.220]   But he said God did that.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.800]   God in his wisdom arranged the members of the body, each one of them, as he chose.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.340]   He did it on purpose.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.040]   If we were all single members, where would the body be?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.980]   As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.220]   The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again, the head to the feet,
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.980]   "I have no need of you."
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.860]   He deliberately made it so that you're only a piece of that body.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:41.700]   Meaning, he made it so that you are dependent upon the other members of the body.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.160]   He deliberately did it that way.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.040]   We would think, like, well, it'd be much easier for church planting if all the gifts were
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.140]   in one person, then we don't have to worry about other people.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.100]   Just one person can do it, can do it all.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.380]   But that's not the way he made it.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.540]   And he said, even if you don't recognize, even if you say you're a toe and you say,
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.180]   "Well, I don't need the hand," you may say that, you may even believe that, but it wouldn't
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.940]   be true.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.180]   Because God didn't make you that way.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.860]   It is our pride that causes us to think that I can be independent of the church and still
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.380]   survive and be very fruitful.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:20.240]   He says, no, God deliberately arranged the members as he chose fit.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.580]   He says, on the contrary, verse 22, "The parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable."
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.860]   He deliberately placed weaker members in the church.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   Now, the weaker member could be spiritually weak, and in the church we have spiritually
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.460]   strong people and spiritually weak people.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.980]   We don't weed out people.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.380]   If you are a genuine believer in Christ and you're walking with God and you don't meet
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.260]   a certain standard, you're out.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.820]   Because in the body of Christ, we have everybody.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.700]   As long as you are a genuine believer in Christ, we have young believers and we have more mature
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.780]   believers.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.940]   Weaker also could mean people who are not of honorable position before they became a
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.500]   Christian.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.980]   That there are some people who may have been runaway slaves.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.380]   There are some people, economically, maybe they were challenged.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:13.460]   And there were people who didn't have a lot of clout or honor before they became a Christian.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.900]   They're also in the church.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.060]   He says, God placed all of them in the body of Christ.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.300]   And they are indispensable.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.980]   The people that we may think at times, because of our frustration, because of their weakness,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:32.300]   because sometimes of their constant failing, may think that maybe the church would be better
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   without them.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.860]   But he says they are indispensable.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:43.220]   And on those parts of the body that we think less honorable, we bestow greater honor.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.160]   We bestow greater honor on the part that locked it, that there may be no division in the body,
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.180]   but that the members may have the same, what?
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.740]   Care for one another.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.100]   It's not just another way of saying so that we may have same love for one another, so
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.700]   that we may practice love.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.900]   He said he deliberately put in the body of Christ people who are different, people who
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.860]   may be harder to love, people who are weak, and we are not to reflect the society in our
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.380]   world.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.140]   Whatever club, whatever golf club, whatever different organizations that you're part of,
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:23.180]   there's something that is different in the body of Christ that ought not to reflect the
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.500]   world but the kingdom of God.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.480]   We know that we're not going to get there fully until he comes.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.580]   But until then, we are to strive the kingdom that Christ established in the church.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.380]   And he deliberately placed different people with different gifts for different purposes,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.580]   all for what?
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:48.060]   To practice love.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.460]   Isn't that the greatest pursuit of any Christian?
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.060]   Isn't that the greatest goal of any sanctification?
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.140]   You know, when we think of sanctification, we can easily think about, you know, being
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.820]   disciplined and obviously we need to take the word of God seriously.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.700]   We need to be more in prayer.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:08.620]   You know, we need to be concerned about the people who are around us and people who are
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.660]   poor and feeding the homeless and all this stuff.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.860]   All these things are great.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:20.300]   But you can do all of that and be weak in love and all of that means absolutely nothing.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.860]   Isn't that what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13?
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.380]   Even if you give your body to be burned in the flame and even if you're martyred without
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.760]   love, it means nothing.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.620]   So the greatest commandment is to love God.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.240]   And second is like it, to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.560]   If Jesus said, when the outside world looks at us, how will they distinguish us from the
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   rest of the world?
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.060]   It's like, well, because we're more moral?
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:50.020]   I mean, hopefully we're more moral, but because you're more disciplined?
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.540]   Because you're smarter?
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.340]   Because you have more honor and you've achieved more?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.380]   And we have a gathering of a lot of smart people?
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.400]   No.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   Absolutely not.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.960]   He said what distinguishes us from the world is the love that we practice with one another
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.340]   as Christ loved us.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.820]   See, everybody practices love.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.460]   Everybody practices love if they're lovable.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:21.300]   But what distinguishes us from the rest of the world is Christ saw sin and instead of
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.900]   running the other way, he ran toward us.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.740]   Not for his own sake, but for mine.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.120]   Because I needed it.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.300]   Because the natural way that we practice love is if we walk into a room and we see sin,
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.060]   our natural reaction is disgust.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.420]   I don't want to be around these selfish people.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.620]   I don't want to be around this guy or her.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.460]   I mean, my life is short.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.620]   My life is hard enough as it is.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.860]   I don't want to engage with these people.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.620]   Our natural reaction is to run the other direction.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.780]   And that's the kind of love that the world practices.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:59.740]   But God, in his wisdom, places us in a part of a community where we can't run from sin.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.620]   We're a part of a covenant relationship, just like there's a covenant relationship between
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.860]   husband and wife, and you don't see the ugliness of your wife and your husband and say, "Ew,
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   I don't want that."
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.860]   And then you walk the other way.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.620]   That's why it's a covenant relationship.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:22.820]   The greatest part of our sanctification is to learn to love, especially when it's difficult.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:28.500]   Not to love certain kinds of people, not to love people my age, not to love people who
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:35.620]   are mature, but everybody in the body of Christ, because he loves them.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.100]   And I shared with you that when I was back in college, I was part of an apartment training,
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.900]   and our apartment at Biola happened to be a little bit more intense than normal because
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.080]   the guy who led our apartment was only about three years removed from the Korean military.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.800]   So as you can imagine, the Korean military is intense because they're always at that
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.020]   border and they're always on the verge of possibly a war.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.900]   So they're trained to be very physical.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.940]   So he tried to apply that in our apartment training.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.020]   So every apartment training, woke up, did quiet time and did all this physical stuff,
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.060]   but he kind of took it to the next level.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.280]   He ran it like a military.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.720]   So whether we fell asleep at 10 o'clock or fell asleep at 3, 5.30, you're waking up.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.260]   You wake up, went to Biola, we ran the track.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.960]   Then after that, we would have devotion, memorize scripture, eat breakfast together, go out,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.260]   go to the classes, come back.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.380]   I mean, it was just crazy.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.340]   And I benefited tremendously from that, from the disciplines.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.460]   Wouldn't let us watch TV, no movies, no...
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.820]   Like he wouldn't even let us hang out with friends.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.380]   Most people would not have wanted to be a part of that, but I was already headed into
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.460]   ministry and I thought it was beneficial.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.580]   And I was discipled by my former youth pastor, so I thought this is great training.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.740]   So I was getting training in the Bible at school and I was getting in personal training
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.420]   at the apartment.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:01.860]   And it took me a while to realize that the real training at this home was not the discipline.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.540]   Discipline was just a superficial part of it.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:11.100]   And I remember about a year and a half to two years into it, I started having this animosity
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.440]   toward one of my roommates, which I never showed.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.240]   On the surface, I never showed.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   But you know how it is.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.360]   Those of you guys who ever have roommates or are married, if you live with somebody
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.460]   close enough, you know like everything that they have gets exposed.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.300]   And a lot of times it's like the church.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.820]   You know, you first come in, you only see the surface and then you stay here for a while,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.420]   after a year, two years, after the honeymoon was over and you see all the cracks and you
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.980]   see all the selfishness and whatever it is, the weaknesses, and you see all of that.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.540]   Eventually, we see all of it after you break the first, you know, the honeymoon period
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.540]   is over.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.180]   About a year and a half, the honeymoon period was over and I started seeing certain different
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.140]   personalities, you know.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.940]   And this one particular guy just rubbed me the wrong way.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.260]   He would never help out.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.780]   You know, we would always eat and he would always eat the most.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.100]   You know, we would eat and he would eat the most and then he's done.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.700]   He puts his plates in the faucet and then he's gone.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.900]   When you're playing basketball, it's like we're always there cleaning up to him and
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.460]   he never says thank you, you know what I mean?
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.500]   And then after a while, like even the way he brushed his teeth bothered me.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.740]   When he went to sleep, how he folded his bed, you know what I mean?
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.420]   When somebody bothers you, like everything about them bothers you and it kind of got
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.060]   to that boiling point.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.820]   But I was just keeping it to myself because I knew a lot of this stuff was superficial.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:41.700]   Well, one day I got really sick and I didn't have health insurance and it got to a point
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.340]   where I felt like something's wrong.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.580]   This is not just normal sick.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:50.180]   I mean, so I asked my older roommates, "Hey, can you come and pray for me because something
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.420]   is not right, you know?"
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:57.900]   And so they come and again, you know, they're hyper charismatic.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:03.180]   So at that time, and so they had got all the oils ready and they were going to anoint my
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.500]   head and then they're going to cast out whatever sickness that I had and they were ready to
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.620]   pray for me.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.780]   And then the guy who was personally discipling me, he must have noticed something in me that
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.860]   maybe I thought I was doing a good job hiding it, but he noticed it.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.180]   And he said, "Peter, do you have anything to confess before we pray for you?"
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.500]   I said, "Confess?
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.860]   I asked you to pray for me, you know?"
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.020]   And he said, "You need to confess."
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.540]   So, you know, like obviously he asked me to and he's my leader.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   So I said, "Okay."
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:38.300]   You know, and obviously the first thing, if I say this is going to be awkward, you know,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.980]   and he actually wasn't there at that time, you know, so I felt a little bit safer to
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   say it.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.940]   But once I say it, it's out and then, you know, I can't take it back.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.020]   But he specifically asked me, "Do you have something to confess?"
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:55.100]   And so I sat there, you know, or I was lying in my bed and so I confessed that I've had
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.500]   this animosity and it was really bothering me, these things, and I know it shouldn't
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.460]   bother me, but it was bothering me to the point where it's just constantly like eating
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.020]   at me.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.020]   And he said, "Okay, good.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.020]   I'm glad you confessed.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.860]   We're going to pray for you."
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.220]   And right before they started praying for me, one of the guys who was sitting next to
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.820]   me said, "I have something to confess."
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.300]   And then I said, "Okay, what is it?"
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.820]   And then he basically said, "I have something against Peter."
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.860]   And then he started confessing why he had this against me and he doesn't like the way
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.180]   I brush my teeth, I guess.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:35.060]   And all this stuff started to come out and so it became really awkward, you know.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:40.140]   And so they ended up praying for me and it really like, surprisingly, right after they
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.740]   prayed and they left the room and the fever broke.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.060]   I was in my sickbed for about three days and the fever broke right after they prayed.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:54.980]   And I was walking around, even my roommates were looking at me like, "It worked."
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:00.820]   And I remember through that whole thing, obviously I was very thankful for their prayers, but
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:09.460]   I realized through that period that the real discipleship in that home was not the discipline.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.820]   Discipline is very superficial.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.900]   Again, it's necessary.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.740]   You can't say you know God and you don't read your Bible and you don't pray.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.380]   We need to have that.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:24.620]   But the real transformation is taking place within our heart, where the Holy Spirit is
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:31.020]   reaching in and seeing the pride and the hatred and bitterness and whatever it is that He
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.460]   begins to transform us.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.140]   And He deliberately puts us within the context of the body of Christ with all different kinds
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.740]   of people and our natural instinct is, especially if you're in a church, a larger church, where
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.660]   you can just like, "Here's my friends that I feel comfortable with and I don't like these
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.660]   guys."
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.220]   And so you can kind of live all your life, even as a Christian, keeping certain people
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.940]   that you don't like at bay, "Well, these are my friends and those are people that I just
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.220]   tolerate."
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.820]   And then you get married and you realize you can't run from these problems.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:10.060]   See, the greatest aspect of our sanctification that God calls us and commands us to is to
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.780]   love.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.060]   It's the most important thing that we need to work on.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.220]   It is the greatest thing that we need to work on.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   It has the most effect.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.820]   It has the deepest transformation and it is also the most rewarding.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   See, in any home, in any apartment, there's different kinds of roommate.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.100]   And this is something that I've observed.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.700]   If you've ever lived with a group of people or maybe even husband and wife and with your
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.420]   children, there's five different types of roommates.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:48.540]   And you can kind of make the connection here, don't judge people, but you'll know right
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.420]   away which one you are.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.940]   So think about, ask yourself who you are.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:59.660]   The first roommate is a dirty roommate and he's dirty also in the common area, meaning
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.380]   that he just doesn't have it together.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.460]   You go into his room, it's messy.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.580]   Wherever he goes, it's just messy.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.820]   He uses the bathroom, it's messy.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.820]   He uses the kitchen, it's messy.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.920]   And so he's always frustrating to other people, but he's unaware because that's just who he
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.460]   is inside and out.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.100]   So we have people like that at church, right?
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.260]   And that's what we're trying to encourage and disciple and bring them along.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.460]   But this person is just consistent everywhere, inside and out, that's just who he is.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:35.180]   The second person, he's dirty in his room, but he's clean in the common area.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:40.520]   So he's more concerned about his friends.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.780]   So he wants to make sure that everything is okay there, but his roof is a mess.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.320]   You can't get in there, you know, like where is the bed?
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.560]   You know, his laundry is always there, he's never clean.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.060]   But in the common area, he's always clean because he's very concerned about what other
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.740]   people will think.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.540]   Eventually that person will get burnt out, right?
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.340]   Because it's not consistent.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:10.660]   The third roommate is the one who is clean in his room, but he's dirty in the common
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.140]   area.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.500]   Don't look around, you know.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.020]   He's clean in his room, he's dirty in the common area, and he just can't stand the fact
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.020]   that his roommates aren't clean.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.620]   And so he's always asking, like, why don't you clean your room?
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:31.060]   But he never lifts his finger to help out, other than to point it out.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.620]   So there are those roommates, and those roommates are very difficult to live with.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.020]   But there's somebody even more difficult to live with than that person.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:42.780]   It's the one who is dirty inside, and he's dirty outside, and he's complaining about
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.140]   dirt of everybody else.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.460]   There's always that one guy, he's just completely oblivious, just how filthy he is.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.300]   And he's always complaining about the dirt of other people.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.780]   And when that person lives with you, God will test you.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.740]   He will test your patience, right?
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.860]   The best person to live with, obviously, is the one who is clean inside, and who's clean
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.860]   outside.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.700]   And whenever that person is there, he's always helpful.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.460]   They got it together at home, and they're always good at it.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.980]   And whatever they're involved with, they just help other people.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.660]   And it helps the person who is dirty realize, "Oh shoot, maybe I should help out."
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.180]   And they inspire other people to do so.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.140]   Every church, any community, has all five.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.140]   Has all five.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.540]   Obviously, our goal is to become that person where we are disciplined and love the Lord
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:40.540]   inside and out, and just our presence in the church inspires and encourages other people
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.020]   to do the same.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.900]   That's our goal.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.260]   But the thing is, we walk into a church, and I will only attend a church that only has
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.580]   church people like that.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.040]   And that church doesn't exist.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.260]   It doesn't exist.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:03.100]   Because God deliberately places us in context so that you can grow in your faith to practice
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.340]   love.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.380]   The greatest aspect of our sanctification has to first take place internally.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.060]   And Jesus does that deliberately.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.260]   Because He really wants us to grow.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.180]   He really wants us to fellowship.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.920]   He really wants us to know His own heart.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.140]   And we will never know that if we are running from everybody makes us feel uncomfortable
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:30.260]   when Jesus saw our sins and He came to us.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:35.820]   See, let me wrap up with 1 Peter 4, 8.
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:41.900]   It says, "Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   sins."
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.660]   Obviously, He's not saying that if you love one another, we can sweep all the sins
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.660]   underneath the rug.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.260]   That's not what He's saying.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.620]   There's two applications of this.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.540]   What does it mean for the love to cover a multitude of sins?
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:02.380]   One, love helps us to be gracious with shortcomings of other imperfections.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.880]   The underlying commitment that we need to have one another is, "Do I love them?"
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.520]   If I love them, we'll be a lot more patient.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.620]   We wouldn't be as eager to expose other people's sins if we really genuinely love
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.700]   them.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.860]   And the standard that I try to use, because sometimes it's hard for me to discern even
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.380]   my own heart.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.420]   I could think that I'm doing righteous things and serving God and I have a Bible
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.380]   verse to stand on, but am I really practicing love?
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.900]   Is the reason why I'm doing what I'm saying, is it motivated by love?
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.700]   And again, it's hard for me to even discern my own heart.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.840]   So usually the way I try to apply it is, would I do this if this was my wife?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.280]   If this was my mom?
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.620]   If this was my brothers or my children?
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:54.400]   If I would be as eager to expose their sins if they were like my children?
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.920]   And that's the standard that I would use.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:03.320]   So first standard is, if we genuinely practice the love that God calls us to love, we would
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:10.280]   be a lot more patient and a lot more gracious and not more willing to cover over their sins.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.640]   But that's only the first application.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.340]   The second application we find in James chapter 5, 19-20 is that, "My brothers, if anyone
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.340]   among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.180]   brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.020]   multitude of sins."
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.720]   So not only will we be more gracious, we would be more righteous.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.640]   Because there are certain things that I would only say to my children because I love them.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.220]   If my children are going down a path that I know is detrimental for them, I'm not going
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.060]   to say, "Well, I don't want to say this because I don't want them to not like me."
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:54.180]   I would be more bold in speaking up and being righteous because of my love.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.460]   And just like it says in Ephesians chapter 4, 15, "Rather speaking the truth in love,
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:04.580]   we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ."
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:11.020]   So sometimes when we practice grace without love, we just don't want to deal with sin.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:18.060]   And sometimes when we practice righteousness without love, we just have holy vengeance.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:23.140]   When we recognize who we are and what God placed us in, and when we are affected by
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:32.180]   the love of Christ, the immediate application is grace and righteousness, both.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:39.300]   So our primary pursuit in the body of Christ and in his wisdom and the way that he put
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:47.380]   us together, our greatest pursuit ought to be the greatest gift, which is what?
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:54.460]   Of the three, there's love, faith, and hope, and of the three, the greatest is love.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.940]   So I pray, again, and we're not going to get to the task part, I'm not sure exactly when
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   we're going to get to it, but at least for this part of it, that when the immediate application
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.060]   of everything that we have been taught in the 11 chapters of Romans in view of this
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:14.800]   mercy to present your body as a holy and living sacrifice, which is your reasonable, logical
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:21.140]   act of worship, the immediate application ought to be, who do I love?
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.260]   How do I love?
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.580]   I pray that that would be the case.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:30.260]   Let's take some time to pray, again, as we ask our praise team to come.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:37.500]   And again, we can hear the word and not apply it specifically, and not deliberately, but
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:41.060]   passively become hearers without doers.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.420]   And so I want to encourage you, as it takes us time to pray, be specific about how should
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.420]   I apply this?
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.240]   What are some things that need to be applied in my life?
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.660]   Are there people that I've shunned?
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.860]   Are there situations or groups that I've created within my circle because I feel comfortable
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.060]   with them and I don't want to be bothered with these people?
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:06.260]   And as a result of that, there are crucial areas of your life that are not being sanctified.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.980]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord and ask the Lord, "Search me and know me,
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:15.100]   see if there's any hurtful ways in me that I may apply the love of Christ in the body
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.100]   of Christ."
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.220]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
