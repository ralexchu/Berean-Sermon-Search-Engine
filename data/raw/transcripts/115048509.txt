[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   Luke chapter 2 verse 22 on we're looking at the whole section but I'll read up to
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.440]   verse 32 but we're looking at the whole section up to verse 38 Luke chapter 2
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.120]   verse 22 to 32 reading out the ESV is when the time came for their
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.640]   purification according to the law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.840]   to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.960]   male who first opens a womb shall be called holy to the Lord and to offer a
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.840]   sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtle
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.480]   doves or two young pigeons now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.920]   and this man was righteous and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.160]   and the Holy Spirit was upon him and it had been revealed to him by the Holy
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.560]   Spirit that he would not see death until t death before he had seen the Lord
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.240]   Christ and he came in the Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.240]   in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the law he
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.400]   took him up on his arms and blessed God and said Lord now you are letting your
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.560]   servant depart in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.920]   salvation that you have prepared in presence of all the peoples a light for
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   revelation to the Gentiles and the glory to your people Israel let's pray
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Heavenly Father we thank you for your constant grace and love toward us but as
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   we ready ourselves Lord God for this Christmas season help us Lord not to be
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.920]   caught up with the rest of this world just in the busyness Lord of buying
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   presents and getting together with families vacations that in the midst of
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.880]   all of this Lord God that you would keep our heart pure and focused on you and
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.240]   what this day symbolizes and represents for us that Christ in being very nature
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.920]   God not considering equality with God something to be grasped but becoming
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.400]   nothing like us help us for you God to glean from his sacrifice and to learn
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.680]   father God what it means to be a eager participant of what you have done for us
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.760]   and thank you in Jesus name we pray amen again as you as you know Christmas is
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.840]   coming up in in a few weeks and I think every Christmas season we have things
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.000]   that we're thinking about like what to get people you know what am I getting
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800]   maybe some of you guys are young enough or still where parents are have promised
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.720]   certain things for you or maybe some of you guys ordered a iPhone or or your
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.480]   phone and you're waiting eagerly waiting for that to come but I think a lot of
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.040]   what Christmas symbolizes is waiting the concept of waiting for a Christian is a
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.480]   very important part of what it means to be a follower of Christ because the
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.600]   Bible repeated it says over and over to again to us to wait right Psalm 27 it
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.960]   says wait for the Lord be strong and let your heart take courage wait for the
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.720]   Lord again in Isaiah 40 31 there's a passage that you and I are very familiar
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.440]   with he says but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength they
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not weary they shall
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   walk and not faint so in other words in Isaiah 40 the concept of what he's
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.480]   saying is if you want to be strengthened if you want to be run and not grow weary
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.560]   or faint so we have to wait right our typical type of thinking is not waiting
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000]   because especially in our culture waiting is not something that our
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.680]   culture especially our generation is known for we're not good at waiting
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.920]   right internet takes more than five seconds it's we need to we need to get
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   another phone you know what I mean you order something and it doesn't come on
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.080]   time send it back it didn't come back come on time you order food doesn't come
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.720]   timely you know again you messed up so our culture our generation is not good
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.600]   at waiting so to come to the scripture where it keeps telling us that in order
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.960]   to be strengthened you have to wait you have to be patient and over and over
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.360]   again we are told this story well if you look at the text that we're looking at
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.840]   obviously we have the larger picture of the redemptive history about the coming
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.640]   of Christ and so we're going to be taking a closer look at that next week
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.000]   but this week we're examining Luke at this particular part of it and when Luke
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   is presenting Christ at the temple you know the larger picture basically is
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.920]   telling us that Jesus was an obedient disciple or obedient follower of the
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   Old Testament law just like any other faithful Jew so even from birth it over
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.720]   over again it says in verse 22 and the time came for the purification
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.360]   according to the law of Moses and that phrase is repeated about five or six
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.760]   separate times that he came and and came to be circumcised according to the law
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.440]   he came and was dedicated according to the law they made sacrifices of pigeons
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.040]   according to the law and then according to the custom of the law they did all of
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.360]   this so over and over again the central thing that Luke is trying to say is that
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.280]   that here's this Jesus that from the beginning of his earthly life not only
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.000]   he but even his parents were very focused on making sure that he was
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.160]   obedient now this was extremely important to present because the whole
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   purpose of Jesus's existence was that he would qualify for what he ultimately
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.100]   came to do to be a sacrifice for sinners now if he didn't obey the law of God he
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.040]   would be disqualified that's why the first thing that we see when Jesus comes
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   onto the scene as a to do ministry he comes and gets baptized and so John the
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.800]   Baptist says why do you why do I baptize you you're the one that I've been
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.360]   preparing for you should baptize me remember what Jesus says he says no is
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   right for you to baptize me to fulfill all righteousness right again that Jesus
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.500]   submitted himself to God's order right after he's baptized he's taken into the
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.920]   wilderness in the wilderness as he is tempted every time he conquered the
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.360]   temptation by saying it is written it's in the scripture in other words to
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.000]   establish him as the perfect sacrifice that he is qualified to die for sins of
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.080]   mankind that's why it was important for us that from the very beginning that all
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.560]   the Gospels all the gospel writers present Jesus and that again he was
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.200]   obedient in every way and that's again the larger picture of what Christmas
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.800]   symbolizes that what we are to remember and to celebrate but within this larger
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.480]   picture of redemptive history there are there are many stories right there there
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.160]   are side characters that kind of we can personally relate to that we're not just
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.600]   observance of this of this redemptive history we're just kind of sitting from
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.760]   a distance and watching but God somehow brings in characters right sometimes
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.120]   they're kings sometimes they're peasants sometimes they're very well educated
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.800]   sometimes they're very normal average people just like the people that we see
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.400]   here in this passage Simeon and Anna is introduced to us and we don't see them
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.320]   again this is the only time where Simeon and Anna is mentioned so we don't know
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.440]   anything about them before the scene we don't know anything about after this
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.920]   scene they weren't kings they weren't noble people they weren't Pharisees we
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.080]   don't know much about them they just all of a sudden appear and the central thing
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.360]   that we are taught about them is that they were simply waiting they were
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   faithfully waiting for the Lord to come we see if you can look at the passage
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   with me in Luke chapter 225 this is how Simeon is introduced to us is that now
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon even his very name it's a
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.640]   very common name you'll see the name Simeon everywhere else in the scriptures
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.680]   and they're not all the same people because it's like John Kim or Peter Kim
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.280]   it's very common right every time I go to DMV I have to say Peter H Kim and
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.600]   then I have a number 32 behind it because there's so many other Peter H
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.680]   Kim's right Simeon is one of those names is a very common name right so even even
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.640]   this is very name itself Anna again is a very common name right that every a lot
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.840]   of females had the Simeon and this man was righteous and devout waiting for the
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   consolation of Israel and the Holy Spirit was upon him and it had been
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.480]   revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.080]   seen the Lord's Christ what an awesome thing to have heard from the Holy
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.400]   Spirit and say you're not gonna die until you see the Lord I mean that's
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.680]   kind of like me wouldn't that free you to do whatever you wanted right if the
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.240]   Lord said you're not gonna die until you see the Lord said well now I can go to
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.600]   skydive I can go deep sea diving you know I can go tightrope walking I do
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.480]   whatever because he said I'm not gonna die right maybe you'll get hurt but
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.600]   you're not gonna you're not gonna die right God said to him again as he was
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.200]   devoutly and faithfully waiting for the Lord and it's in that context where he
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:03.160]   comes in encounters with the Messiah again we see this lady Anna in verse 36
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.760]   they said there was a prophetess named Anna the daughter of Phinewel of the
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.760]   tribe of Asher again we other than this we don't know much about her she was
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.720]   advanced in years having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.360]   virgin and then as a widow she until she was 84 she did not depart from the
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.760]   temple worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day in the ESV if you
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.800]   look at your translation most of your translation will have some sort of
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.400]   number or letter on it and they don't have some note on the bottom right so in
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.320]   the ESV translation it just says she was 84 years old in some of your other
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.440]   translations will say that she actually was widowed for 80 years 84 years
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.880]   depending on how you translate it either way look at it whether it was 60 some
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.320]   years or 80 some years she basically dedicated himself to serve God and said
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   night and day she was praying and she was waiting to this and then it wasn't
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.280]   just that if you look at verse 38 it wasn't just them two there were many
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.480]   other people in verse 38 and coming up at the very hour she began to give
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.280]   thanks to God and to speak of him to all who are waiting for the redemption of
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   Israel so it wasn't just a man it wasn't just Anna it was a lot of people who are
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.960]   eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come to deliver them and it's in this
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.320]   context where Jesus shows up so it wasn't like there was no prophecy there
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.600]   was nothing going on there was a group of people who was eagerly waiting for
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.120]   him and now as we as I mentioned that concept of waiting in the Bible is
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.640]   extremely important like as a Christian to wait upon the Lord like if you go and
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.080]   Google and or if you have a Bible concordance look up wait I mean you'll
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   have hundreds and hundreds of that phrase being repeated over and over
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.200]   again to tell us to wait wait wait right even the disciples before they were
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.320]   gonna go out and preach the gospel what did you say wait wait until the Holy
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.640]   Spirit comes upon you even now we are living he said our spiritual life as
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   we're preaching the gospel one of the key characteristics about our
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.000]   sanctification or salvation is to wait wait for his second coming and everyone
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.880]   who puts his hope in him will purify himself so this idea of waiting is a
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.760]   central part of what it means to be a follower of Christ we a worshiper of
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.560]   Yahweh but what does it mean what does the word wait mean how do we apply
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.840]   practically apply this other than just kind of like okay we'll just sit here do
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.800]   nothing right what is the Bible's concept of wait the most common word
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.320]   that is translated for weight in the Old Testament the Hebrew word is kava and the
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:53.240]   word kava is basically lit means to be bound together to be bound and when you
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.840]   hear the word bound literally it means your bath like right you're not you
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.200]   can't do that you're restricted from doing something and that's the idea of
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:10.480]   this word to stay put to stay where you are in Psalm 37 7 says be still before
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.360]   the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not yourself over the one who prospers
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:24.680]   in his way over the man who carries out evil devices he says to be still again I
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.040]   don't know about you but you know and I know I see some of our kids at our
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.480]   church and I could totally relate to the to the more ADD you know what I mean
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.920]   type of I would have if they had ADD medicine when I was younger I'm pretty
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.600]   sure they would have popped it in my mouth you know as soon as I went to
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   school right waiting no one has ever accused me of being patient right and
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   especially in our generation being patient necessarily is not like a good
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.240]   quality because we're taught to be problem solvers right we're taught we're
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.320]   all taught to be problem solvers if you're good at problem solving you make
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.080]   more money if you're in a company and you see here's some issues that aren't
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.520]   working right here's a problem identify it well here's a solution how do we get
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.120]   there step one step two step three and you you are good problem solver right
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.760]   and that's kind of like the mentality of our generation's like what's the problem
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.000]   solve it now if you live in a poor part of the world I remember you know we were
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.320]   talking while we were on this compassion trip now how do you define poverty and
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.760]   one of the pastors he was thinking about it so you know I think poverty means
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   lack of opportunities right lack of opportunity you don't have a choice
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.600]   whatever is presented to you you have to make do with what you have but you don't
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.960]   have opportunities that's not me and you you and I have finances you we have
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.760]   freedom we can move we can change jobs we have all kinds of stuff because we
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.320]   have we have you know physical blessing but along with that comes this idea or
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.120]   this this paradigm that if we just apply ourselves more if we can just kind of
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   figure it out and do this and do that that we can make this work and and
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.280]   sometimes we apply that very type of you know we can do it type of mentality even
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.160]   in our walk with God and sometimes it's good at a lot of times it's detrimental
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.920]   the first concept of being a follower of Jesus Christ to be a worshiper of God is
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.840]   learning to wait upon the Lord Psalm 62 1 and 2 says for God alone my soul
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.200]   waits in silence from him comes my salvation he only is my rock in my
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.840]   salvation my fortress I shall not be greatly shaken see the whole nation of
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.000]   Israel God promised them as they went into captivity if you look at the minor
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.960]   prophets and the major prophets every time that God brought judgment upon the
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.680]   nation of Israel he would always relent and then he would promise that even
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.280]   though you're I'm taking you to judgment I will deliver you I will send the
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.360]   Messiah and he's going to deliver you and and there's going to be a new
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.000]   generation of of God's people going to worship him and so when they heard this
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.280]   they said yes God is not going to forget about us but the trouble that the nation
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.880]   of Israel got into was they began to will themselves for this to happen see
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.600]   the Sadducees they they again saw the problem as the Romans you know the
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   political situation so their idea of deliverance was if we are politically
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.960]   more influential if we had more money and if we were more clever that we can
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.640]   somehow win the favor of the superpower and maybe that's how God may turn things
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.720]   around for us and you had the zealots the zealots are the ones who are
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.200]   military you know like by by military might that if we train ourselves and
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.760]   have our knives sharpened enough and if we get enough people to come on board we
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.960]   can fulfill the promise that God said the Messiah is going to come but we're
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.680]   going to make this happen but I think the most subtle and the most dangerous
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.720]   of them all were the Pharisees because the Pharisees thought to themselves that
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.760]   if we just implement and obeyed the Sabbath if we obeyed the laws and that's
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.560]   the reason why the why the Jews their ancestors got into trouble but if we
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.920]   obeyed the law if we did this if we keep kept the Sabbath if we didn't go into
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.600]   the Gentile homes if we ate the right things and not eat the wrong things that
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   somehow God is going to show us favor and that's how he's going to bring about
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:33.880]   his promise on a surface it seems like well that sounds right if we just do the
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.040]   right things God's gonna bless us and the danger of that type of thinking is
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.880]   that it can easily become nothing more than superstition see if they thought
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.240]   like well if we keep the Sabbath for so long that's God's gonna have to he's
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.600]   gonna have to listen to us how that is suddenly it creeps into our thinking
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.960]   creeps into our church is is you know I know a lot of you guys are studying for
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.080]   finals right now a lot of you students and some of you are gonna take the test
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.520]   and then you wake up next morning you blew it right you blew it I'm not saying
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.840]   you you you will I'm saying some of you some of you might okay you're gonna wake
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.520]   up and and then you say oh my gosh I didn't do it and then you're gonna start
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.840]   thinking backtracking what could I have done maybe if I did my quiet time first
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.480]   maybe if I did my quiet time the guy would have blessed me and I would have
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.800]   remembered all this stuff maybe some of you are waiting for for a job right
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.240]   you're waiting for you apply for jobs and you're waiting eagerly and and you
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.600]   didn't get it and you start thinking to yourself I haven't been faithfully
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.720]   tithing I haven't been faithfully doing this and I missed too many Bible studies
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.160]   you start to backtrack and thinking maybe God is punishing me disciplining
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.360]   me because I didn't do this and then and then you start to train yourself to
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.600]   think that if I do the right things that somehow God is gonna that's all gonna
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.400]   add up and God's gonna say okay now you twist my arms since you obey me I'm
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.080]   gonna listen to you and then suddenly what begins to happen is we start to we
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.960]   start to have this idea of superstition and Christianity becomes nothing more
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.840]   than superstition that if we do this if we step on the crack you're gonna break
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.000]   your mama's back if you don't read your Bible God doesn't give you a good home
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.880]   right well the Pharisees had this kind of mentality was teaching the people
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.360]   that if you obey the law that everything is gonna be alright if you just do what
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.720]   we told you to do see what the whole gospel the whole gospel begins with all
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.480]   have sin and fall short of the glory of God those who have the law are condemned
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.880]   without the law with the law those who don't have the law are condemned without
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:49.360]   the law and so there's nothing you can do to stack up and get closer to God so
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.920]   the first act of when we come to God the first thing that he tells us to do is to
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.720]   wait to wait upon the Lord to sit still and recognize there's nothing that you
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.520]   can do and I can do to hurry up what God has intended again I don't know about
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.880]   you but you know God always that's one aspect of my life my character that I
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.040]   always just challenging me like to be patient to be patient and he surrounds
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.400]   me with people that that forces me to be patient you know I I have a tendency to
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.640]   go a hundred miles per hour and Esther goes about five five point five you know
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.920]   what I mean so whenever we go places I'm always walking in ahead of her and some
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   people think all of that male chauvinist you putting his wife behind this no
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.480]   because she just walks slower so whenever we talk like a lot of times I
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.560]   end up finishing her sentences not because all we're so in love we're so
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.080]   connected because I want her to finish her sentence she's not talking fast
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:57.040]   enough you know pastor mark is the same way there are times when we get into a
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.680]   conversation and I'll ask him a question about something and it'd be dead silence
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.200]   because he's on the other side so I said oh okay I guess we're done so I would go
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.480]   back to work and the five minutes later he was like hmm so the whole time he was
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.760]   thinking about what to say I like I moved on I'm already doing Bible study
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   and doing other stuff to be patient you know it's not my second nature and I
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.600]   think again as a as a generation as a whole are when the Bible says become be
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.520]   like wait wait upon the Lord we don't naturally say okay we know what to do
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.680]   because we're problem solvers you have to be problem solvers right to get good
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.960]   grades you have to be problem solvers at work in order to advance but he says to
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.240]   wait the word for wait again there's another word the one is to be bound the
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:55.120]   other one the mom it literally means to be silent or rest and in some some of
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.400]   the Bible dictionaries it says to be dumb right obviously literally it
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:06.120]   doesn't mean like lower your IQ right it means to rest it isn't just simply
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.440]   waiting and saying I'm gonna sit here I'm just gonna cook off my mind and just
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.600]   kind of just wait until something happened well that's not the idea of
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   wait the way the as the Bible teaches us is to rest knowing that the answer is
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.160]   found in him to rest not to immediately think well here's a problem if we
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.360]   implement these three things would have solve it and so much of our frustration
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:36.120]   and anxiety comes because we think like why don't they implement this why don't
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.920]   I do this why don't is he do that and we want our husband to change we want our
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   wives to change we want our churches to change and then when it doesn't happen
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.680]   we're frustrated when the Bible continually reminds us the first and
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   foremost to wait upon the Lord see this Simeon we don't know how old he is but
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.320]   we know that he've been patiently waiting and God rewards him Anna for 60
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.600]   70 80 years just quietly serving the Lord and in that context God reveals
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.080]   himself to her to her and to the rest of the nation of Israel you know whenever
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.480]   we think of the Jews we think of the Pharisees Sadducees and all these people
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.520]   who kind of missed Christ but not everyone missed him and we're gonna look
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.200]   at that next week about the various people who came to Christ but there were
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.560]   people who were faithfully waiting and as a result of that God revealed himself
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:30.200]   to them you know when I was younger and people would come and ask for counseling
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.280]   it would drive me nuts because I feel like you know I felt so and if there was
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.560]   any part of ministry where I felt the most inadequate was counseling because
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.520]   all kinds of people are coming to me with all kinds of problems and I know
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.560]   what to do up on the pulpit because it's just me right I just need to prepare and
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.720]   I need to speak I know what to do in Bible study because I need to prepare
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.040]   and and to present it to you and if if it you know if you're learning and
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.120]   you're growing I know what to do when people come to me with counseling have
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.280]   all kinds of issues marriage issues you have your family issues you have your
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.360]   work issues and and interpersonal relationship issues and and some things
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.480]   are pretty obvious right some things I've dealt with so long when I say don't
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.520]   do it you know I mean it's pretty obvious I'm not gonna say what it is
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.400]   all right but there's some things are obvious but there's a lot of stuff that
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.760]   that are brought up I really don't have any answer and I remember that used to
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.680]   drive me nuts because like man maybe I need to go get biblical counseling you
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.040]   know maybe I need to get more training maybe if I did this maybe if I did that
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.240]   maybe I'm just not good at this maybe I'm just maybe I'm doing something I'm
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.400]   just never gonna be good at because in my mind my first inclination is I got to
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.040]   solve this problem right how many of you guys get into problems because your wife
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:50.680]   tells you something and you had you think like huh do this and then your
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.280]   problem is solved right and she says thank you
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.960]   yeah you're laughing because that doesn't work right now because our
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.120]   natural instinct especially as a guy is we think like we have we have to solve
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.080]   this if I'm gonna help you we have to solve this and that's basically what I
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.320]   was thinking and one of the most important things that I realized about
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:19.920]   being a pastor is sometimes there's no answer there's no human answer and the
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.840]   answer is wait for the Lord you don't have to do anything you don't have to
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.040]   find a solution I don't have to give you a solution for every problem I don't
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.720]   have it I know he does and so the greatest advice I realized that I can
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.280]   give is to give you Christ to explain Christ who he is and how much he loves
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.000]   me how much he loves you and it may not directly apply or at least we can't
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.240]   connect it to it but it says wait for the Lord because it is in his time
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   see Ecclesiastes 3 1 through 4 says for everything there is season and a time
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.680]   for every matter under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.880]   plant and a time to pluck pluck up what is planted at a time to kill and a time
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.160]   to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.240]   laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance and it goes on and on basically
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.840]   mean God has ordained certain seasons for certain things to happen in our life
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.120]   for a particular purpose it's when it's time to build when we are breaking down
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.860]   where we have the problem when God has ordained a time to mourn and we're
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.360]   dancing and it's time to weep and we're laughing because we think that oh here's
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:40.280]   a situation and we need to fix it first and foremost he says to wait remember
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.440]   the disciples when they were on the boat and the storm came I could totally relate
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   with the disciples because Jesus was so fatigued again you know don't forget
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.960]   that Jesus Christ is 100% God and so he was out laboring and working he was so
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.480]   tired he said the Son of Man does not have a place to rest his head meaning he
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.920]   was tired you know on to as long as he's doing ministry there's nowhere for him
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.960]   to go so if you're gonna follow me thinking that somehow I'm gonna lead you
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   to a nice home like don't follow me because the Son of Man has nowhere to
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.600]   rest his head and he was genuinely tired fatigue he was so fatigued the storm
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.320]   started coming and you have to imagine these are professional fishermen I think
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.200]   before they woke him up they tried everything right what does he know he's
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.360]   a carpenter right if we need a chair we'll wake him up right but we're in the
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.160]   middle of a sea and we're about to die so I think that they he probably
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.840]   probably implemented everything that they possibly know bring out the row you
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.800]   know everybody laid on the left side they started rowing you know they put
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.240]   the sail up put it down you know throw off these every you know the heavy
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.080]   weights everybody go to the left go on there go up they probably tried
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   everything and nothing was working they were absolutely desperate and again
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.640]   sometimes God allows us to get to that point of desperation because we don't
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.280]   listen until we're at that point right until we've exhausted we come to the
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.800]   point where we surrender we don't listen it's like oh what about God you know
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.120]   what do you know about this we don't say that right but that's how we behave
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   sometimes so by the time they wake up Jesus remember what they say they don't
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.520]   say hey Jesus Jesus there's some we have some problem can you help us he doesn't
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.760]   say that remember how the disciples come Jesus don't you care that we're gonna
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:37.840]   die they're already angry they've tried everything they saw the problem they
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.120]   try to fix it they couldn't fix it and they're watching Jesus just sleeping
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.920]   right so they're annoyed they're angry they come to him Jesus how come you
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.720]   don't care right Jesus does Jesus wake up like oh shoot oh so sorry everybody
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.840]   calm down calm down boom let's go back to sleep is that what happens no Jesus
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.520]   wakes up and he said why did you not believe why did you not believe what do
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.360]   you mean by that because on the surface I can relate with the disciples because
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   I think every single one of us look at that situation we would have done
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.640]   exactly the same thing right I mean they're about to die they're fishermen
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.800]   and they can't fix this problem what are you doing right what did Jesus mean by
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.560]   that you have to remember when Jesus said come follow me I will make you
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.780]   fishers of men what was his primary thing that he was trying to teach the
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:37.520]   disciples he was trying to reveal himself to them right yes he taught them
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.560]   how to evangelize he taught how to cast out demons but in the midst of all of
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.360]   that the greatest thing that Jesus had to reveal to them was himself who he was
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   so remember at John chapter 6 when all these people were falling out he turns
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.120]   to them he's are you gonna leave to remember what the disciples say you're
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.040]   the Son of God you have the words of life where are we gonna go in other words
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:07.760]   we believe you so what was Jesus saying when he said why did you not believe all
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.720]   this time that you were with me you were safe did you believe that you heard me
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.800]   say I'm the author of life and you believe it you have the words of life
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.960]   where are we gonna go you believe it do you think that somehow because of this
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.240]   little storm that I just slipped for a second that somehow you were actually
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.600]   gonna die that all of a sudden he forgot he took your eyes off for you for a
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.320]   second that somehow he forgot about his power and he forgot that he loved you
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:39.160]   and that you're gonna sink you're with me as long as you're with me if you die
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   it's because I let it and if you don't die is because I won't let it so when he
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.700]   said how come you didn't believe he wasn't just speaking generically he's
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.360]   talking about do you not know who I am said in the context of them trying to
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:59.160]   fix all of this stuff in the context of them trying to run around and and making
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.000]   sure that we're okay that you forgot the very thing that causes your life to be
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.720]   stable is me that the author of life everything was made by him and for him
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:17.120]   that he sustains life that I'm on this ship I'm with you it's not because you're
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.000]   a fisherman it's not because of this or that that's what he meant so when the
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.560]   scripture says first and foremost be still and know that I am God to wait
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.080]   upon the Lord it's the first and foremost for us to have peace and rest
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   that he's the answer that would not mean like okay I gotta figure this out what
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.840]   do I do how do I how do I change this what do I do what do I implement where
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.640]   the first and foremost is to wait for him to fulfill what he has ordained
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.560]   that's why you know when the scripture says that at the fullness of time God
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.880]   came Jesus came fullness of time so when Simeon was praying and was revealed to
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:04.320]   him the Son of God was gonna come it was a fullness of time Anna 60 70 80 years
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.680]   it was because the fullness of time was God's ordained time there's nothing that
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.360]   they could have done to speed this up or maybe if we went out and and made better
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.560]   roads and a lot of you know in some sense was every time we talk about
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.040]   fullness of time we say all the Romans came in and built the roads right yes
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.200]   they built the roads and it made the access a lot easier but couldn't God
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.880]   have done that did God have to wait until way way wait it's not time because
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.280]   I'm waiting for the Romans to conquer Alexander and we have to wait right
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:43.320]   couldn't God have just said couldn't have just made the roads right oh we
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.480]   didn't wait until the the language is all unified and they all spoke Greek so
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.000]   when Paul went and preached that they could understand each other true all of
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.160]   that was a huge help but he's the one who divided them in the first place the
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.520]   reason why they couldn't understand each other is because he said boom you know
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.120]   you guys get together speak the same language and look what you do with it
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.720]   right you become arrogant proud want to become like me so he's the one who
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.360]   confused him so couldn't he have just and then all of a sudden everybody's
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.800]   like hey like I we understand each other right Google Translate could have
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.440]   happened thousands of years ago if you want it right so yes all of these things
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.560]   were helpful but I think when the Bible says the fullness of time when the Bible
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.720]   says God gave the law and the purpose of the law was to make it make sure that
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:41.880]   sin became utterly sinful that the law had to take its natural course kind of
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.000]   like a drowning man and if you probably heard this illustration before a
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.120]   drowning man the way they train to jump into the pool is that don't jump in jump
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:55.160]   to save that person until he is helpless because a drowning man who's reaching
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.240]   and scratching when you jump in they're gonna grab you and you're gonna sink
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.680]   together so what they do is they wait until their helpers and they run out of
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:08.160]   fight and then you can go grab that person and then bring them back well
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.280]   that's basically what the law was was here to do was to reveal sin and to make
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.880]   it utterly sinful so they'd have to take his natural course where people are
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.360]   fighting and scratching and I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that and then when
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:28.840]   they get to a point like nothing has worked nothing has worked and then if
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.960]   you look at Jesus's ministry the three on from a human perspective for three
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.560]   years he poured himself out in this three particular cities right near
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.200]   Galilee and at the end of it what does he say to them if the same things were
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.120]   performed to tire and sight and they would have repented long ago so after
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:55.440]   three years stirring and fatigue they reject him and by the time he's he's on
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.680]   the cross humanly speaking if he was successful you would think that there
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.840]   would be a mob running and say you can't crucify him instead at the end of his
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.880]   life the mobs are saying crucify him crucify him so in every way humanly
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.760]   speaking it was an utter failure if the purpose of Jesus's ministry was to
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.280]   gather a large crowd and to and to go out with a bang then it was an utter
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:29.920]   failure see what Jesus's ministry was an extension an intensified extension of
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.040]   what God was doing through the nation of Israel with the law they failed again
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.800]   and again and again and again absolutely helpless and then Jesus comes and if you
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.120]   look at his ministry instead of people's passion for God growing the very few
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.160]   people who he came to love end up crucifying him on the cross it was one
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.720]   thing for people from a distance hearing saying you know what we reject God's law
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:00.640]   we reject the prophets but as another thing when the Son of God himself comes
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.520]   and he's face to face in his and then they say we reject him so if you're
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.640]   talking about when Israel was at its darkest in his history was when Jesus
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.560]   was headed to the cross every possible opportunity was given to them and they
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:22.960]   said no it was in that darkness Jesus reveals himself now when the scripture
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.120]   says that he demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.360]   sinners and that's what we need to come to understand when he said while we were
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.200]   yet sinners we weren't passive sinners we were actively actively backs
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.720]   blaspheming him actively rejecting him and is in that context where it says the
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.840]   fullness of time the fullness of time meant the sin became utterly sinful and
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.480]   mankind was absolutely helpless it brings us to a point where we throw our
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.560]   hands up is I can't do this it is not me see every single one of us there's a
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.800]   part of us that thinks there's a part of us that thinks that we can do it right
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.040]   there's a part of us maybe not preaching maybe not evangelizing but there's
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.000]   certain things that you're good at if you happen to be you know a lawyer you
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.240]   know and your job is to argue and argue you know and you don't that's you that's
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:25.600]   your expertise so in that area in that area we think I can do this remember
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.640]   after the resurrection Jesus meets the fishermen he meets his disciples and
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.960]   they're fishing all night they caught nothing right and Jesus says throw the
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.880]   net in remember what the disciples said it's like we've been fishing all night
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.120]   we've been fishing all night we're professional fishermen and we've been
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.360]   fishing all night and we caught nothing and you a carpenter I know you're the
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.800]   Messiah you know even after he was resurrected from the dead I know you
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.360]   resurrected from the dead and the only reason why we're gonna do is because
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.280]   you're telling us but we're fishermen we're perfect we know how to catch fish
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.600]   right you know how to preach you know how to heal people but we know how to
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.160]   catch fish but because you said so we're gonna do it so remember what happens
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.720]   they put it in they catch so much fish they can't even pull it up by themselves
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.360]   and Peters they're actually counting and I heard a funny story that people said
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.600]   that maybe maybe they counted because Matthew the tax collector was with them
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.440]   and he was counting because that was his habit and I mean he counted it so you
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.800]   owe me and then they say oh shoot forgot I'm a disciple now I'm no longer a tax
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.160]   collector right see that's a tendency for all of us because whatever every
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.240]   single one of us there's an area that we're not good at there's an area that
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.720]   we're good at and the things that we're good at we have a tendency to think I
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:50.000]   can fix it first and foremost is to come and rest in him to recognize that when
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.200]   it comes to this matter of following Christ and knowing him our salvation
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:59.280]   every single one of us is absolutely helpless and but to be helpless doesn't
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.040]   mean okay now since I'm helpless I do nothing I just I just sit here and let
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.000]   God do whatever he wants there's actually the word that is used here say
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.120]   where Simon Simeon waited for the Lord the word here waited is that in the New
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.240]   Testament the Greek word is pros decamite and the pros decamite means to
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.040]   actively search that's that's the word that is used for weight in the New
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.240]   Testament so again when you put it all together it means to be bound it means
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:35.040]   to rest in him but in this binding in this resting we are apt actively seeking
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.520]   that's the word that is used in Luke chapter 12 36 or 37 when we are told is
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.320]   that be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.560]   wedding feast the word waiting here is pros decamite the same word that is used
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.760]   to describe Simeon's waiting that he wasn't just at the temple he wasn't just
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.520]   at home kind of like huh when is this gonna happen he actively sought the Lord
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.760]   that was the biblical waiting and that's why he says when we are waiting for his
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.920]   second coming we are not to sit passively and say well he didn't come
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.480]   today just like Anna at the temple actively praying and fasting seeking and
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.520]   being ready who knows when he's gonna come who knows what God's gonna do when
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:24.420]   he's gonna do it and so they actively sought him out in lamentations 325 that
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.000]   Lord is good to those who wait for him to the soul who seeks him it is good
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.360]   that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord and let me again
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   wrap up with this in Jeremiah 29 13 says you will seek me and find me when you
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:48.240]   seek me with all your heart are we waiting for the Lord I know that in a
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.360]   week and a half we're gonna be celebrating Christmas we're gonna be
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.440]   talking about you know a lot of things then you know I don't know if it's as
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.180]   controversial as it is this year as it was in the previous years in the
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.800]   previous years the big fight was what we can't say Christmas right and everybody
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.400]   was so angry we can't say hey target won't let us say Christmas don't go to
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:12.360]   Target anymore right Costco won't say to they'll say Mary happy something but no
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.920]   Christmas and we're all creed we're all offended right and I think there's a
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.480]   place you know we live in a free country we could speak right we can vote and
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.280]   these are our rights we guess I don't think there's anything wrong with that
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.360]   but in the end so what so what if we get to say Christmas or not to say
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.560]   Christmas what is that how does that change our eternity how does that change
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   the eternity of of souls who are lost because they say in fact it kind of
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.880]   gives a false sense of security somehow like we're winning the battle because we
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.720]   get to say Christmas that we get to pray you know at mayoral you know
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.800]   inaugurations or at the you know at football games we can we can say in
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:01.320]   Jesus names I guess we can do it now right in the end what is that what does
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.720]   that change in eternity in fact gives us a false sense of security that somehow
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:14.240]   we are winning this battle and that's actually more dangerous because in the
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:21.920]   end all it has done is just put up more superficial religious legalism it means
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.280]   nothing has no power in the kingdom of God our fight is not against flesh and
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.160]   blood it is not by our might nor by our power he says by his spirit and we can't
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   force that we can't will that you can't have enough money to do that you can't
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.760]   be talented enough to have that so that's why first and foremost he says
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:51.200]   wait upon the Lord wait upon the Lord the consolation of Israel it's not a
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.800]   interesting word consolation of Israel the Savior the King the Messiah but here
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.040]   he said he's the consolation of Israel now if you look at in the context of
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:06.400]   book of Luke Luke is trying to present a human side of Christ and so Luke
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.600]   presents Jesus as the consolation the comforter and over over again the Bible
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   describes God as our ultimate comforter he's our counselor you know the
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.360]   difference between sympathy and empathy and again those are you're gonna
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.040]   question me so I already looked it up you can look it up yourself okay empathy
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.880]   basically is to from a distance like I I didn't walk in your shoes but I feel for
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.480]   you right so I don't know what you're going I don't I can't relate to what
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.960]   you're going through but I feel for you that's empathy sympathy is somebody who's
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.080]   able to step in your shoes like you've been there so if you're a doctor or
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.880]   whatever field you're in somebody is in those shoes I can I can understand so
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.640]   some of you stay-at-home moms you'll sit and talk to other stay-at-home moms and
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.880]   immediately there's a connection because you can sympathize with each other right
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.600]   I talked to other pastor friends who are wrestling with the same thing and and we
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.880]   can sympathize with each other so there's empathy from a distance and
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   sympathy because they walk their shoes walked in the same shoes well the
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.640]   scripture says in Hebrews 415 that we have a high priest who was able to
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:13.680]   sympathize with our weaknesses because he drew near to us he walked in our
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.880]   shoes so that we have a we have a mediator who sympathized because he was
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.640]   there and yet without sin therefore he says he's opened the throne of grace with
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:29.680]   to enter it with confidence to find in grace and mercy in times of trouble he
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.720]   says those doors have been opened so that you can come in seek him and to
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   know him to wait for him and that's what they were waiting for and finally as a
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.080]   result of meeting him this is what Simeon prays in Luke 2 29 Lord now you
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.240]   are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word for my eyes have
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.760]   seen your salvation to put it in modern English not that this isn't modern
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.280]   English but to make it more modern right what he means by that is now I can die
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   in other words this was it this is what I've been waiting for this was my hope
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.440]   this was my passion now I can die you know I meet people every once around say
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:16.640]   you know I don't want Jesus to come yet because I'm not married I need to be
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.800]   married that's one thing that I like that and that's the passion in life like
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.840]   I gotta get married he can't come now right well I don't have children he
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.760]   can't come now I just started a business he can't come now you know I put all I've
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.960]   been saving up my vacation to go to Europe he can't come now whatever it is
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.800]   that we have treasured in our heart and that's what we're waiting for that's
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.200]   what's gonna be in your mind it's gonna be in your heart wherever you wherever
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.360]   you put your treasure that's where your hearts gonna be so if you're eagerly
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:56.160]   anticipating and your hope is in your next iPhone that I mean you know again I
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.520]   got a new galaxy note 4 so I'm not you know what I mean I'm not judging you
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:10.760]   right I'm just saying if that becomes our treasure if these silly little
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.960]   things becomes our treasure and then we get together we could tell right away
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:19.440]   what we are passionate about you know this is coming it's not here yet but
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.880]   what kind of apps what's the best app for this thing and you're always looking
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   up like what's what's the best case for this what's the best case you know what
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.560]   I mean what can you do well look at the quality of the picture and you're just
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:37.680]   like this is it this is it and these trivial things we get entangled with it
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.880]   we know we know it's trivial we have so many things that we we kind of get
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.520]   entangled within and then we just kind of go from one gadget to a next one
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.200]   event to a next one thing to the next and we find out that our heart is not
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:46:00.080]   waiting for him at all if Christ came would you say now I can die that this is
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.680]   what I've been praying for this is what I've been waiting for so our challenge
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.040]   through our Christmas season is the world is gonna be busy buying presents
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.000]   getting together they're gonna all this stuff is happening but it's a great
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.080]   opportunity if there's any period in the year where you can openly talk about
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:21.880]   your faith is during Christmas talk about I'm going to church a Christmas
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:27.000]   service you know it's Christmas Merry Christmas right so what do you mean by
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.960]   that you can share the gospel if there's any time where you can take advantage of
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.240]   the of the culture that we live in it's Christmas but in order to do that we
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:42.760]   have to wait for the Lord we have to be rested in the Lord if we're anxiously
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:50.000]   running around to fix things and not recognize the author of life is with us
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.480]   that we have access to him then all this opportunity that we have we're just
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:58.360]   gonna blow it so my prayer is again as Christmas is coming up in the midst of
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:03.680]   busyness in the midst of all the things that that we're involved with that we
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.720]   take some time to step back and recognize what it is that got crisis
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:14.200]   given and that we can honestly say Lord we are waiting on you would you take a
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:21.600]   minute to pray with us as we invite the praise team to come up let's pray that
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.120]   God would help us to use the time that we have use a Christmas season to redeem
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.720]   it for for him redeem it for ourselves that we can use this opportunity the
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.080]   vacation time that's coming up you know not just to be busy we're running around
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.960]   with families in buying presents but really take some time to meditate and
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:43.720]   think upon what his incarnation means to us how should that affect my family my
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:49.080]   life my future who are the people around us that would be a great opportunity to
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.280]   share the gospel with and to use that opportunity so let's take a few minutes
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.360]   to come before the Lord in prayer
