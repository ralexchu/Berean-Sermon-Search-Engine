[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.620]   All right, we are taking a short break because we have communion today and we want to make
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660]   sure that we're all on the same page as we participate in this communion.
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.260]   And so we want to take some time to look at the passage in 1 Corinthians 11.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.700]   The whole text that we're going to be covering is from 17 all the way to 34, but I'm just
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.140]   going to be highlighting the text in verse 23 to 26.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.760]   First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 to 26, "For I received from the Lord what that which
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.900]   I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.140]   bread.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.320]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.740]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.860]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.860]   in my blood.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.700]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.820]   For as often as you eat the bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.820]   he comes.'"
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.740]   Let's pray.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.540]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would bless this time.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.460]   May your word have power to change our hearts, our mind, and our very lives.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.140]   I pray, Father God, that what you have intended in this text, that it would have its full
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.880]   effect in us.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.380]   So we ask for your blessing and your grace.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.380]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.380]   Amen.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.100]   You know, in our generation, we have a cliche that we've been saying.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.460]   And the cliches are there for a reason, because at the core of it, there's some truth.
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.940]   But cliches are also very dangerous if you don't understand the context in which it is
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.060]   said, and then you kind of universally apply in all things.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.340]   I think one of the most commonly heard cliches in our generation is, "Christianity is a
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.540]   relationship and not a religion."
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.740]   You probably heard that before.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.180]   You may have said that.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.820]   At the core of it, it's true.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.740]   And the problem that that cliche addresses is, because we are living in a post-Christian
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.940]   culture, that there's a lot of things that we do, we just automatically believe that
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.180]   we've been raised in a church, and if my parents are Christians, or my great-grandparents are
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.140]   Christians, that it would just kind of pass down to us.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.140]   In fact, they did a survey a while back to see what percentage of Americans consider
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.180]   themselves Christians.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.060]   And so, again, this is a little bit outdated, and I think the number is a bit less than
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.620]   that now, but back in the '90s, the number was almost 86% of people surveyed said that
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.020]   they were Christian.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.660]   Obviously, we know that that's not true, right?
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.140]   We know that, based upon what we know in Scripture, that that number is exaggerated.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.580]   That means there's that many people who believe that they're Christian because they were either
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.300]   raised in a church or have some sort of Christianity in their home, and as a result of that, that
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.020]   they themselves believe that they are saved.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.420]   Now, it is that type of culture that this cliche is addressing, that Christianity is
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.340]   not a religion but a relationship, that there needs to be a personal relationship with Christ,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.940]   which is true.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.540]   You can't just come to church and through osmosis and just by being in a Christian home
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.540]   make you a Christian.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   There has to be a personal relationship with Christ.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.420]   But along with all cliches, there's also the flip side of that, that if we're not careful
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.100]   and if we apply it to the fullest, it's not necessarily true because Christianity is a
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.100]   religion.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.140]   Because the definition of religion is a set of doctrine or rules that distinguishes that
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.140]   particular religion with any other religion.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.060]   So Christian religion is distinct from Muslims or from Buddhism.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.180]   There's a different set of doctrines that they believe that causes them to say that
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.620]   we are set apart and we're different in this way.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.100]   So Christianity is also a religion where we adhere to certain doctrines, and if you do
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.580]   not adhere to these doctrines, you are not Christian.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.820]   And so, especially in our generation, because of this cliche has been applied, there's a
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.900]   lot of people who say, "Well, it doesn't matter if you go to church because it's just personal
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900]   between me and God."
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.340]   Especially in this YouTube generation after the pandemic, we have so many people who say,
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.460]   "Well, physical church is not important because it's about my personal relationship with God."
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.140]   It is about your personal relationship with God, but there are specific, very focused
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.180]   teaching that distinguishes us and tells us that this is what a Christian ought to believe
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.140]   and ought to do.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.260]   Now along with that, the reason why I introduced my sermon this morning is because of the religious
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.980]   things that we talk about, there's two things that, if we're not careful, that we can just
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.900]   simply dismiss.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900]   We just do it.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.300]   You just grew up doing it.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.020]   The two ordinances that we're talking about.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.060]   So when we talk about religiousness, we say, "Well, I mean, that sounds very legalistic
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.820]   saying like we need to be baptized or we don't get saved because of baptism."
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.420]   So it doesn't really matter one way or the other.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.900]   And same thing with communion, right?
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   It doesn't save us.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.040]   It doesn't give us any specific power.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.700]   So it must not be too important.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   It's just another religious activity.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.660]   Well, as I said, religious activity is important because these are two ordinances that has
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.340]   been set apart as sacred.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.640]   When baptism is done correctly, it is a public proclamation of our faith.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.220]   It reminds us of our own testimony.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.140]   It is the entrance into the local church, the universal church.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.340]   So when done properly, it reminds us of who we are, our identity, the power of the gospel.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.140]   And so baptism is an integral part.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.340]   It's the first act of obedience in the church.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.860]   And that's why even Christ, when he was being baptized by John the Baptist, he says, "I'm
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.300]   doing this to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.380]   Jesus himself submitted himself to baptism because that's what was established.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.780]   Communion is another one of those where we just practice it and maybe you grew up in
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.240]   the church practicing this and it just happens and maybe not understanding the significance
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240]   of it.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.260]   So whether we participate in it, how we participate in it, it doesn't really matter because it's
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.260]   just one of those duties.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.780]   You just come on Sunday and it just happened to be communion so you're just going to participate
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.980]   in it.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:43.660]   When baptism is done poorly, you grow up thinking you got baptized so at some point in my life
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.020]   I got baptized so I'm saved.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.640]   I'm covered by the blessing of God.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.100]   We have people coming into our church all the time.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.180]   And I got baptized when I was two or three or five or even when I wasn't a Christian
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.080]   I was at some camp and we just jumped into the water.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.880]   Everybody who came out, we were all baptized and so therefore I'm good.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.860]   So we have a generation filled with people because of the way that baptism was done have
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.220]   a misunderstanding that that somehow covers them from their sins.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.380]   And same thing with communion.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.220]   If communion is done poorly, you have a generation of people who just because they're taking
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.800]   communion that somehow it has some magical protection power and that kind of connects
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.620]   us to God and so we're safe at least for this period until next communion comes around.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.660]   Obviously communion in and of itself has no power to do that.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.540]   What I want to look with you this morning through this text, four things that it points
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.540]   out that the communion was given us for.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.860]   If communion is done correctly, it reminds and refreshes our worship to our Savior.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860]   That's number one.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.120]   Number two, if communion is done correctly, it causes us to examine ourselves and see
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.600]   if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.320]   It's for our sanctification.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.760]   Third, if done correctly, it restores and unites the fellowship of the body of Christ.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.160]   It sanctifies and unites the church.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.000]   Four, when communion is done correctly, it proclaims the gospel until he comes.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.200]   So I want to go through these four points that are listed in this text and as we go
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.760]   through it, hopefully when we participate in the communion that we would have a renewed
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.320]   sense of commitment, renewed sense of reverence toward what it is that we're doing this morning.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:35.000]   One, when done correctly, it reminds us and refreshes us of our worship to our Savior.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   First Corinthians 11, 24 through 25.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.200]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body which is for you.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.680]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper saying, "This cup is the new covenant
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   in my blood.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.220]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me."
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.960]   So first and foremost, we participate in communion.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.420]   Communion has been set apart in order that we can remember and focus our attention upon
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.720]   Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.860]   The reason why this is so important is because you and I have a natural tendency to forget.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.840]   How many of you, you don't need to raise your hand, but how many of you were adults
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   when 9/11 happened?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.580]   A handful of you, right?
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.840]   If you remember when 9/11 happened, I mean, it was a shock for all of us to see the Twin
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.280]   Towers fall that morning.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.400]   We've read about war, we've seen movies about wars, but all of a sudden war became real,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.720]   that United States is being attacked.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.760]   Thousands of people just perished just instantaneously.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:49.280]   And I remember after that, I saw something that I've never seen in my lifetime, and I'm
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.920]   not sure if I'm going to ever see it again.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:59.440]   I saw the Democrats and the Republicans linked arm to arm, came out in public at Capitol
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.260]   Hill and basically saying that, "We will never forget.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.140]   You attack us, we're united, we're resolved."
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.240]   And as a result of that, it changed the way we flew.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.160]   You couldn't wear shoes anymore to go to the airport.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.600]   All of a sudden, all kinds of liquid had to be banned.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.320]   But at that time, people were more than willing, more than willing because they said, "We will
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   never forget."
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.160]   That was the mantra of that period, "We will never forget."
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.760]   And the reason why they kept on saying that is because they were reminded, we were reminded
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.320]   that we have people around the world who hate this country and what it stands for, and that
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.480]   they will do everything in their power to attack us.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   So we're going to be ready.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.160]   We're going to be resolved.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   We're going to be united.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.200]   We're going to do whatever it takes.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.160]   And so Republicans, Democrats came together, arms linked, saying, "We will never forget."
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.600]   Well, guess what?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   We forgot.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.700]   Decades have gone by, and now the TSA has become a joke, an inconvenience.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:08.680]   And so, right or wrong, all the stuff that was implemented at that time being so resolved
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:16.660]   that we're going to be ready to fight and go to battle, for the most part, we've forgotten.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.520]   Whatever your politics may be, at that time, the reason why it was so important that we
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.840]   never forget is because of the consequences that if we do forget.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:34.240]   When Jesus says, "Do this in remembrance of me," God knew our tendency to drift.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.360]   And so this that Jesus is referring to was the Passover meal that they were participating,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.440]   that God commanded the nation of Israel.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.880]   As soon as they left Egypt, God commanded the Passover meal to be celebrated every year.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.080]   This is what he says in Exodus 13, 3.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.040]   "Then Moses said to the people, 'Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt,
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440]   out of the house of slavery, for by strong hand of the Lord brought you out from this
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.680]   place.'"
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680]   He said, "Do this."
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.040]   And he implemented this as soon as they left Egypt.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.560]   Not a year, not 10 years later, but as soon as they left, because God knew the moment
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.960]   that you forgot why or how you became a nation, you're going to start to imitate all the other
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.920]   nations.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.400]   That the whole reason why Israel even exists is because of God's power and his mercy and
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   his covenant.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.040]   Again, he says in Deuteronomy 7, 18, "To remember that in the midst," when you go out there
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   and then you run into troubles and powers that are greater than you physically, remember
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   who God is.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.480]   Remember how he delivered you, Deuteronomy 7, 18.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.000]   "If you say in your heart, 'These nations are greater than I,' how can I dispossess
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   them?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.120]   You shall not be afraid of them, but you shall remember that the Lord your God did to Pharaoh
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.560]   and all of Egypt, the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.080]   hand and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   So will the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid."
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:10.600]   In the time of distress, in the time of trouble, and you begin to think that the powers that
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.720]   surround you, that are suppressing you, is greater than you can handle, he says, "Remember,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.460]   he who began a good work in you, he will carry it unto completion to the day of Christ.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.880]   He who did not spare his own son, he loved you so much that he gave his only begotten
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.600]   son," and that same power, that resurrected Christ, dwells in you.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.200]   That Holy Spirit dwells in you.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:40.520]   How much of our depression, how much of our anxiety comes because we forget.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.800]   We forget.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.440]   We're children of God.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   He loved us so much that he says he counts our very hairs, and yet when our finances
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:57.120]   don't meet or we fall ill or something doesn't seem quite right going forward, and maybe
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.160]   we didn't save enough for retirement, or whatever causes anxiousness, how much of that
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.240]   is because we have forgotten what it is that we already have in Christ.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.060]   Why was this so essential for the nation of Israel?
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:19.040]   Because the success of the nation of Israel was directly linked to their faith in God.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:25.960]   The moment they begin to drift from focusing their eyes on Christ, not just their finance,
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.440]   not just the nation, everything begins to crumble.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.360]   Same thing with all of us.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.800]   If our whole life is connected to Christ, the moment we begin to forget what it is that
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.000]   we have, it's just some theological thing that we check off, but it's not real.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   We sing about it.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   We memorize.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   We study the scripture.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.520]   But when we examine our life carefully, how much of our life actually reflect the faith
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.900]   that we profess on Sunday morning?
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.440]   How much of our anxiety and depression or whatever it is that we struggle with is directly
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.680]   linked to forgetting what it is that we have in Christ?
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:13.720]   See, fourth and finally, why we need to remember, he says in Deuteronomy 8.18, and I believe
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:19.560]   for us who live in Orange County, this is probably our greatest struggle.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.520]   He says, "Take care lest you forget the Lord your God by not keeping the commandments and
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.160]   his rules and statutes which I commanded you today, lest when you have eaten and are full
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:35.080]   and have built good houses and live in them," listen carefully, "when everything is going
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.180]   well, you have a nice house and you have a nice car and your bills are paid, when your
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.360]   herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.120]   is multiplied, then your heart will be lifted up and you forget the Lord your God who brought
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.640]   you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.000]   Let me stop right there.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.440]   I know how we are when we're in college.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:09.680]   I know many of you students are in college, but in college, you don't have a lot.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.920]   Your parents have a lot, not you.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.120]   So when we're younger, everything's wide open, and you say, "Oh, I believe in God.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   He's my treasure.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   He's all these."
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.680]   Then you get married, have kids, your salary begins to increase, you start getting into
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.000]   your career and you start becoming a boss, and then you have more money than you actually
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:41.480]   need, and then after a while, you look at your faith, it's nothing like it was when
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   you were younger.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.040]   And you begin to convince yourself that this is normal.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.520]   This is just what happens.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.500]   Nobody maintains their first love, and you just kind of accepted that as normal.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.180]   You remember what it was like when you wanted to go out to missions and the possibility
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:06.520]   of doing work for the Lord and all these things, but now it's just, it's like, "Yeah, it's
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   good.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   It's for some people."
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.120]   But you're busy raising your children, paying off your mortgage, saving enough money for
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.000]   retirement.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.400]   Next thing you know, your heart is hardened toward God, and so you're going through the
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:28.240]   motion and you have a form of godliness, but there's no power.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.220]   All your bills are paid off, everything's going well, and so the temptation is there
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.220]   is no desperation for God anymore.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.680]   You want God, but you don't need Him.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.980]   He says the communion table was given to the church for the purpose of reminding us that
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.820]   everything we have is because of Him.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.980]   As soon as we begin to say, "We're proud and I did this," we begin to forget God, we start
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.300]   to just be religious.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.500]   We sing songs, but there's no passion behind that.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.480]   You have to have a new song every few months because now all these new songs become old
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.480]   so quick.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.320]   You need to constantly have new songs because the songs in and of itself, it's not the words
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.780]   that are causing you to sing praises to God, it's just the newness of things.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:25.840]   Even the sermons, great, but after you hear it for a while, it's like it's another sermon.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.800]   It says in verse 17, "Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.360]   my hand have gotten me this wealth.'
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.040]   You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.360]   that He may confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers, and it is this day.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.320]   And if you forget the Lord your God, and you go after the gods and serve them and worship
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.600]   them," now we may look at that and say, "Well, we don't worship idols."
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.400]   Sure we do.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.080]   Anything that has possessed your heart, any pursuit that is greater than your pursuit
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.200]   of Christ is your idol.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.320]   Israelites never shook their hands at Yahweh and said, "I don't trust you.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.120]   I'm going to trust Baal instead."
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.400]   No, they added Baal to the worship.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.080]   They added Asherah to worship of Yahweh.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.320]   They never rejected God.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.040]   They just added that and they just ran to it whenever it was more convenient.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.360]   So whatever it is that we run to instead of God is our idol.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.580]   He says, "When you run to your gods and serve them and worship them, I solemnly warn
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.460]   you today that you shall surely perish."
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:36.360]   He says, "Once you become proud, once you become independent, once you begin to forget
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:42.200]   God, you are that close of perishing."
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.000]   And in order to prevent them from this danger, He inaugurated the Passover meal so that every,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.320]   every year that they would be reminded the whole reason why you exist as a nation is
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.880]   because God's power and His mercy and the covenant that He made with you.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   And it is that meal, He says, "Do this."
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.320]   What God has implemented with the nation of Israel, do now do this in remembrance.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.840]   All of the Passover was to point to what He was going to do at the cross and that our
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:19.280]   health, our ability to live, to function, all of it is connected to how connected we
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.200]   are to this cross.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:30.080]   Remember, in fact, the whole nation of Israel's downfall is summarized in this text, Hosea
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:38.160]   13.6, "When I fed them, they were satisfied."
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   Let's dissect this.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.440]   What do they mean by satisfied?
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.880]   They were thankful.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   They were blessed.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   They worshiped God.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.440]   They praised God.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.160]   When God fed them, when you got a job, when you were sick and you became healthy, when
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.040]   you have relational problems and it gets solved, when you wanted something, you desire it.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.520]   Whatever it is that you desire, that God gave it to you and answered your prayer and He
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.520]   was gracious and He said, "They were satisfied, thankful, worshiping."
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   He said, "When they were satisfied, they became proud."
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.200]   That urgency, once it goes away, it's like, "Oh, I could do it."
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.800]   Tomorrow morning, whether you prayed this week or not, whether you clung to God or not,
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   if you don't see any difference from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, that's a good
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.080]   sign you've forgotten Him.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.440]   Whether you crack your Bible Monday or not, whether you're praying to Him and seeking
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.240]   Him, whether you feel this urgency to share the gospel or not, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.880]   Thursday, Friday doesn't look any different other than the external pressure to meet whatever
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.680]   schedule that has been placed on your table.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.520]   Outside of that, it doesn't look any different.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.120]   Whether you prayed for, didn't pray for a day, whether you didn't pray for a year, your
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   life doesn't look any different.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.080]   You've forgotten God.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.920]   You want Him, but you don't need Him.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.640]   And as a result of that, whether you admit it or not, your heart is proud.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   You may have the reputation of being humble, and maybe compared to other proud people,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.560]   you may be humble, but in God's sight, you have become proud.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   Because He said your very life depends upon you being connected to Christ.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.080]   But you're not connected to Christ, other than out of religious duty.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.120]   See, the communion table was given to us as a result because God knew our tendency to
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.520]   drift and get entangled.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.160]   And again, most of the time, not with sinful things, just raising kids, paying bills, doing
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:01.400]   a good job at work, having friends, having a good marriage, serving the church sometimes.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:09.860]   And in the midst of all of that, if you're honest, your heart has drifted far from God.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.280]   You can't think of the last time you came in with expectations and wanting to praise
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.380]   God.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.000]   You can't remember the last time that God drove you to your knees with deep sighing,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.160]   this groaning that the Holy Spirit has, desperate for Him, like wanting to connect with Him,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   wanting to commune with Him.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.040]   You can't remember the last time that has happened.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.480]   And so you're just kind of like, "Well, I'm just going to do what I'm supposed to do."
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.160]   And you've been doing that for weeks, for months, maybe for years.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.300]   Next thing you know, for decades.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.700]   So you are what the Bible says.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.520]   You have a form of godliness, but there's no power.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.300]   There's no power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.880]   Everything you say is calculated.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.160]   It's scripted.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.200]   You say what you're supposed to say.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.040]   You say what you say in reaction, but it is not an overflow of your heart.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.720]   You sing because it's time to sing, but it's not an overflow of worship.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.400]   You evangelize because it's time to evangelize, but it's not an overflow of your heart wanting
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.080]   to see the lost come to Christ.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.720]   Maybe it's because we have forgotten.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   Oskin is in his book, "No God But God," basically chronicles three generations of what leads
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.300]   to apostasy.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:36.040]   First generation are the people who believe Christ, and they're the ones who go out to
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.560]   missions and sacrifice, and they're faithful to church and building up the body of Christ.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.880]   And he said, eventually, as they begin to drift, they raise nominal Christian kids because
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   they raise a generation of children who don't have any skin in the game.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.560]   They've sacrificed nothing.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.200]   They've given nothing.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.880]   So they know Christianity from a distance, from set of doctrines, from things that you
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.320]   profess, from Sunday school, from VBS.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.520]   But it is not an active faith.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.760]   It is not a sacrificial faith.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:16.000]   They've just inherited what the first generation has, and they just adopted it for themselves.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.320]   And so now you are raising a generation of lukewarm Christians who are just going through
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.960]   the motion, but they don't really know the power.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.900]   And so their worship is always flippant.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.700]   They go to church, but give the minimum amount of time and effort.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.020]   And then he says the third generation is where apostasy happens.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:43.400]   Children who are raised in a lukewarm home have no purpose for this religion.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.440]   It does nothing other than take away what they want to do on Sunday morning.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.440]   Giving is just throwing away money.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   What is this for?
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.440]   Sacrifice.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   Evangelism.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.120]   It's just weird.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.960]   And so all they see religion as sacrifice and no benefit that comes from that, other
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.880]   than some sort of a security blanket that when I die, that maybe I'll go to heaven.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   And it leads to apostasy.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.680]   And he says from his study, he's not saying that every generation, every family falls
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:19.400]   into that, but even just the years that I've been a pastor and a Christian, I've seen that.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.900]   In Revelations chapter 2, 4 to 5, you know that passage when he is warning the church
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.900]   of Ephesus.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:30.560]   He said, "I have this against you, that you have left your first love."
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.600]   Left.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.080]   In NIV, it says, "You have forsaken."
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.000]   Forsaken is more of the translation.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.560]   It wasn't just something that happened.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   It wasn't an accident.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.000]   You didn't just lose it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.320]   He says, "You deliberately have forsaken it."
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.520]   You know what's interesting?
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.020]   Book of Revelation was written in 96 AD, which means it was about 60 years removed from the
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.160]   resurrection of Christ.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.440]   So it's about three generations where you have children, parents, and grandparents,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.480]   maybe still alive.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.600]   Maybe the first generation have already passed away.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.000]   Second generation are the ones who are leading the church, and then the congregants are the
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.920]   third generation.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   He says to them, "You're doing all the right things.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.300]   You test the apostles to see if they're true, and you do not tolerate false doctrine.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.720]   So you know on paper what to do."
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.580]   But he says, "You have forsaken your first love.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.360]   Your hearts are far from me."
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.000]   And then he says, "Therefore remember from which you have fallen."
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.280]   He doesn't say to innovate.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.000]   He doesn't say to find new ways to worship God.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.320]   He says, "Remember the height from which you have fallen.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.460]   Remember when you were younger.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.120]   Remember when you first met Christ, when he meant everything to you?
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.560]   Every time you heard someone else's testimony, how it stirred you because it reminded you
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.660]   of your own testimony?
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.540]   Remember when you first became a Christian, you were so eager to share the gospel to other
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.360]   people because you can't possibly imagine even strangers coming into the judgment of
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.280]   God?
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.400]   Remember how you dedicated your summers to go overseas to places that are uncomfortable?
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.340]   That you were open if God called you to full-time missions?
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.640]   How you were willing to do all of that?
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:23.780]   But you can't remember now the last time you wept for the lost.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:30.560]   You can't remember the last time you pleaded on your knees for even your family members
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.020]   who may not be Christians.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:38.200]   That our hearts have drifted so far away that we don't remember.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.500]   So we just revert back to religiousness.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.520]   We just do what we're told to do.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.320]   And yet we know that our hearts have drifted so far.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:54.560]   See, the communion table was given to us for that purpose because he knew our tendency
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.520]   to drift.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.220]   He knew our tendency to forget.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:06.880]   He knew our tendency to be wrapped up in our lives and just do what we're supposed to do
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.600]   with no real power.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.960]   If done correctly, it's supposed to revive us, renew us, and refresh us.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.620]   That we would continue what we had from the beginning.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.500]   Number two, if done correctly, it causes us to examine ourselves carefully.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.080]   It leads us to repentance.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.960]   In 1 Corinthians 11, 27-32, it says, "Therefore, whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:38.320]   of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.920]   In an unworthy manner.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.600]   Again, this is just religiousness.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.920]   Whether you do it or don't do it, I mean, yeah, great.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.640]   I mean, you showed up today and we're going to have grape juice and this little chip that
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.220]   we have in here.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.040]   So if you have it, oh, you did it.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.160]   If you didn't do it, it means nothing.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.600]   You're not going to see any difference today, tomorrow, or any day.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.700]   It says here, if you participate in a day because they participate in an unworthy manner,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.060]   he said, verse 28, "But a man must examine himself and in so doing, he is to eat the
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.440]   bread and drink of the cup for he who eats and drinks and eats and drinks judgment to
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.120]   himself if he does not judge the body correctly."
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.880]   In other words, if you don't understand the sacredness of what this is, that this is not
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:35.860]   just grape juice, this is not just some piece of bread, but this symbolizes his blood.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.760]   This symbolizes his flesh.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.920]   And if you participate in an unworthy manner, he says, you are deliberately, willfully bringing
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.040]   upon judgment upon yourself.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.640]   In fact, the early church, people were actually falling sick.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:58.160]   And then some say, he says, they were falling asleep, which means they were dying.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.240]   Imagine how seriously we would take communion if that was happening today.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:11.580]   If we took it today and then some of you are just vomiting, running to the bathroom.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:20.680]   Even if one person died, out of seven, eight hundred people, even if one person died, my
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.100]   guess is next time we have communion, there's going to be some seriousness.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:35.360]   There's going to probably be a church early praying, repenting, examining that you make
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.320]   sure that you're not participating in an unworthy manner.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.140]   But here's the issue.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.220]   We don't see it happening.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:52.020]   I don't remember the last time I saw somebody who got sick and said, "Oh, it's communion."
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.360]   I didn't take it seriously.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.160]   Like somebody passed away, it's like, "Oh, it was an unworthy manner.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.400]   They didn't judge the body correctly, so they died."
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.940]   We haven't seen that.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.920]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   Are you sure that's not happening?
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.400]   It's just a question.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   It's just a question.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.460]   Don't call me a heretic.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.760]   It's just a question.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:30.520]   What if God is actually disciplining the church, but you just haven't connected the dots?
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:37.880]   What if a sickness that was coming on maybe didn't happen that hour?
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.920]   Maybe it happened way later.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   What if it wasn't sickness?
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.840]   What if there was trouble in your life?
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.160]   Turmoil in your marriage?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.720]   Struggle with your children?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:59.600]   What if that was a result of an unworthy participation of the Lord's table?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.120]   We just haven't connected the dots.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.160]   Now I'm not saying that that is, because I can't prove to you that that is, because I
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.400]   don't have any revelation that that is.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:15.480]   But what I do know is that's what it says that happens in the church, in the early church.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.980]   And maybe they didn't even know.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:23.960]   Maybe that's why Paul is saying, "Some of you are falling asleep, and you don't know,
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.880]   but that's as a result of your unworthy manner."
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.440]   Maybe some of them didn't know that that was the connection, and that's why Paul is pointing
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.340]   that out and telling them, "You don't realize the sickness and the trouble that you're having
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.360]   is because you're participating in an unworthy manner."
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   Imagine the revival that would break out in the church.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.900]   Unconfessed sins that we will bring to the forefront.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:51.420]   People who are lukewarm, who just kind of let it be because we're busy.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:57.460]   How much that would affect the church if we actually approached the communion table the
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.620]   way it is established in the early church.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.720]   That's what it was meant to do.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.140]   If you don't believe it, all this is nonsense.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.140]   Just nonsense.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.540]   I come to church, and this guy's making a big deal about communion.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:19.580]   This guy's making a big deal because as long as I go to church, it's a personal relationship.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.820]   As long as I have a relationship with God, all this doesn't matter.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.780]   Of course it matters.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.780]   It's in the Bible.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.460]   What I read to you is straight out of the Bible.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:37.500]   The communion table was meant for us to take time to examine ourselves carefully.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.780]   Am I walking right with God?
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.860]   Is my confession true?
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.220]   Have I swept sin underneath the rug and just forgotten about it?
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.340]   I don't see any consequence.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   Even though there's all kinds of turmoil in your life, you just don't connect it to the
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:57.980]   fact that maybe it could be as a result of a discipline from our Father.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:04.140]   The Bible clearly says that those whom He loves, He disciplines.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.980]   You don't recognize even when you get disciplined that this is discipline from God.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   You seek counsel.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.260]   You seek direction.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.340]   You seek like right things, right decisions, and you seek people.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:24.460]   But did you ever consider maybe it's a discipline from God to bring us, to make us desperate,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:31.500]   to remind us, to get on our knees, to pray, and to cry out to God, to take our sins seriously?
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.240]   Could be.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.780]   At the minimum, we should consider it because it's in the Bible.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.940]   Thirdly, done correctly, it restores and unites the fellowship of the body.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.100]   First Corinthians 11, 18-22.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.220]   For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear the divisions exist among
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.340]   you and in part, I believe it.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.920]   For there must also be factions among you so that those who are approved may become
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   an evident among you.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.340]   Therefore, when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:05.100]   For in your eating, each one takes his own supper, and one is hungry and the other is
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   drunk.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.220]   And he says that if you come and you don't consider the other people in your church,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.660]   he says you're not judging the body correctly.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.460]   That's not Lord's supper.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.980]   There's a reason why we don't take the Lord's supper, we don't take the communion in our
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.720]   homes.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.460]   Because it was meant to be done in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:33.080]   This is not something personal and romantic that you do between two people.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.220]   This is meant to be done in the context of the body of Christ.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.300]   Because part of the meaning behind it is that you and I are all one.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.380]   We're one.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.800]   So when you say, I like these people but I don't like those people.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.580]   I want to spend time with them but those people I don't like.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.960]   These people, I don't like the way they talk.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.940]   Those people I have nothing in common.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.900]   You know, I want to stick with my friends.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.040]   When you do that, you may not be saying that but what you're doing is, I want to stick
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.660]   around with other mouths.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.080]   I'll tolerate the hair because it's close.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.440]   Feet, no.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.600]   No thank you.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.740]   I don't like feet.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.900]   Like fingers, I don't like fingers.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.160]   Something near the mouth.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.960]   I can tolerate that.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.560]   So you come to church, especially as the church gets bigger, you have a sphere of friends
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.120]   that you can tolerate.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:35.360]   Anybody you don't tolerate, they're like acquaintances but they're not family.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.500]   So I don't feel any obligation to love them.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:43.360]   I can tolerate them but to love them, I'm not obligated.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.920]   So we make a tight group of friends.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.720]   And we practice everything that we're taught.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.900]   Hey, I love them.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.640]   You have to be patient with them but only with these people.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.440]   Outside of this that I've created, that's not my response.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.840]   The church is too big anyway.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.120]   God only called me to these people.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.960]   By doing so, you're being disobedient.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:16.520]   We're a family of God whether we're 60 or 600 or 6,000.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:23.920]   The only criteria for my brothers to be my brothers is that we have same parents.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:30.000]   I mean, one could be athletic, the other one may be rich or poor or someone maybe, you
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.240]   know, like to joke around, the other one's serious.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.840]   But we don't say, "Oh, my brother doesn't like joking around so he's not my brother.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.600]   I like playing basketball but he doesn't play basketball so that's not my brother."
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:49.080]   No, the only criteria for them to be my brother is that we have same parents.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.800]   It's no different in the church.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:58.400]   They are my brothers as long as they have the same father, which is God.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.840]   And if that is the case, then everything that the Bible tells me applies to that person.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.760]   Imagine the early church.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:14.440]   The early church had Jews and Gentiles in the same church, right?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:21.340]   They hated each other for centuries and because of the resurrection of Christ, they were together.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.760]   Imagine how difficult that must have been.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.920]   I don't think that Christ resurrected and all of a sudden this benevolent love came
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.000]   over themselves and all that.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.920]   I love these Jews.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.600]   All that time of trying to avoid us and calling us unclean and filthy pagans, like, yeah,
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   just disappear.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.240]   You think it just disappeared?
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.800]   I don't think so.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.200]   They did it in obedience but it exists.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.720]   You know how I know that it exists?
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.040]   Because the very first problem that came into the early church was that the Jews were not
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.560]   feeding the Hellenistic widows.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.880]   They considered them compromised because they started adapting to the Greek culture and
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.520]   they said, "Well, you guys are not as bad as the Gentiles but might as well because
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.680]   you compromise," and they wouldn't feed them.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.480]   And that was not a small problem because if you don't feed the widows, what happens?
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.840]   They get annoyed, irritated.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.560]   They die.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.920]   So if they didn't deal with this problem in a wise manner, it could have completely
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.560]   divided the church from the get-go.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.680]   And in fact, every letter that's written in the New Testament addresses that issue
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   between Jews and Gentiles, Jews and Gentiles, that we're one, we're one, we're one,
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.520]   because they had such a hard time bringing them together.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.280]   But yet they did it.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.000]   And the slave owners, I mean, think about that.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.080]   Think how difficult that would have been to go to someone's dinner and have the slave
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:02.360]   owner sitting there and the one who ran off coming for dinner.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:11.240]   Maybe the slave became more mature and he became a leader in the church and he's directing
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.120]   the dinner and the slave owner who used to own this guy is sitting there having to submit
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   to his leadership.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   Imagine what that would have done to the church.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.800]   It would have ruined the church.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   The rich and the poor.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:32.200]   I mean, in our generation, we have the poor in one town and rich in another town.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.760]   You know why that happens?
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.600]   Years ago when I was actively in homeless ministry, when I used to take the students
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   out to feed the homeless, it was a very popular ministry.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.400]   People say, "Oh, we get to go to homeless and we come back, we fed the homeless and
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.800]   then we go back, play basketball, we go to our normal lives."
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.960]   Well, I had an idea to bring them to church.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.240]   And so we had guys who were off the street and they, you know, they're mentally fine,
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.000]   but they didn't have any money.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.720]   But once they came into our community, it completely changed.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.160]   Because every time they have to go eat, they have to pay for him.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.400]   He doesn't have a car, so you got to pick him up.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.920]   He can't afford clothes, so you got to buy him clothes.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.080]   We want to play basketball, he didn't have shoes, so we have to buy him shoes.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.320]   So they couldn't talk about normal things that they would talk about.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   "Oh, let's go get Boba."
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.560]   You can't say that when he's around because he can't afford Boba unless somebody's going
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.280]   to feed him.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:39.200]   So it was one thing to temporarily be uncomfortable over there, but once they come here, it's
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.840]   like, "Ah."
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:46.080]   And they couldn't articulate it, but people were not happy about it because it just disturbed
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.520]   their peace.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.040]   How much of that happens here in our church?
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.680]   And I'm not talking about homelessness.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.100]   There's certain people that make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.880]   Maybe it's the way they talk.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.100]   Maybe it's their background.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.120]   Maybe it's their socioeconomics, that is.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.440]   Maybe it's their personality.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.920]   Maybe it's their family.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.100]   Maybe it's where they came from.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.480]   Maybe it's their age.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.040]   Maybe it's their experience.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.320]   Maybe you're a Dodgers fan and a bunch of Angels fans.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.480]   It could be as frivolous as something like that.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:32.760]   How much of our friendship and our unity is based upon, "I like him, I don't like him.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.880]   He just says things, I don't like that."
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   And so we comment, "You've created your own community within the community."
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:47.280]   He says, "When you do that, that's not the Lord's table that you're participating in.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   You're just eating.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.760]   You're just drinking grape juice.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.000]   You're just participating.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.320]   You're just having a piece of chip in your mouth.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.200]   That's all it is."
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:05.600]   But when done correctly, when done correctly, we examine ourselves carefully.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   Am I doing that?
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.080]   Am I guilty of that?
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.280]   Do I see them as my brothers in Christ?
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.360]   There's reasons why God put us all together.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.000]   In the church, we have young and the old.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   We have some who are educated, some are not.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.640]   Some are successful, some may not be.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.040]   Some who are poor, some are not.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.840]   We have various backgrounds, various cultures, and there are some people who are sitting
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   around you.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.240]   If you weren't a Christian, you would never cross paths.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:42.160]   And you would never want to cross paths, because you have nothing in common outside of Christ.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.440]   So the moment that we begin to drift away from Christ, it begins to get highlighted
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.320]   you have nothing in common with Him.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:56.960]   So as soon as you stop talking about Jesus, there's nothing to talk about.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   There's nothing to talk about.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   You don't have the same interests.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.720]   You're not similar in age.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.040]   You don't have similar backgrounds.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.660]   You don't have similar personalities.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.200]   You don't get each other's jokes.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:14.760]   And so as soon as you stop talking about Jesus, all the differences become highlighted.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   There's a remedy to that.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.080]   There's a clear and simple remedy to that.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.800]   Don't stop talking about Jesus.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.520]   Don't take Jesus out of your relationship.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.840]   Make Christ central, because the only reason why we're here together, that brings all
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.520]   of us together, is because of Christ.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:43.040]   So the moment we begin to drift away from Christ, we begin to talk about all our differences,
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.800]   all the things that causes me to think that, you know, it's going to be hard for me to
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   be around you.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.920]   So the communion table is meant to bring us back together again and again and again and
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.440]   again.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:04.320]   It is not within our power, but it is our natural instinct to find our communities,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.480]   our niche.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.120]   It goes against our nature to be surrounded by people that make us uncomfortable, and
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.120]   yet that's the power of the cross.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.760]   One of the greatest witnesses in the early church was their fellowship.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.160]   Why is a slave owner and a slave?
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:28.200]   Why did the Jews and the Gentiles, even to this day, the secular scholars can't understand
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.480]   how the church got started.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.360]   So they'll say blanket statement, "Oh, it's because they're all poor."
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   And then they realize Barnabas and all these people who are rich sold their land and they
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   spread it out.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   It's like, "Okay, they weren't all poor."
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.160]   "Oh, it was all because they were up this political things."
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.800]   And then they do some research and realize that wasn't the case.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.160]   Oh, the Jews and the Gentiles, like, how did they get together?
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.360]   They don't have an answer.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.760]   So the power of the early church was their fellowship.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   The people who would have hated each other got together and called each other brothers
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.400]   and sisters in Christ and loved one another deeply.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:16.240]   Let me ask you, because I'm at the end of this, how much of your life you've created
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.280]   to make you comfortable?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:25.000]   How much of your life have you created to glorify God?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.220]   Let me ask you that question again.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:32.920]   How much of the life that you've created, even inside the church, even as we're active,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.240]   was created to make you feel comfortable, make your children feel comfortable?
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.360]   How much of the decisions that you're making, how much of the money that you're spending
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.760]   is about building up the church in the body of Christ?
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:55.280]   When somebody is weak in the church, the strong is responsible to care for them, to come alongside
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.600]   them, to be patient with them, sometimes have to rebuke them, but to come alongside them,
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:07.560]   not to stiff-arm them, but to learn how to care for those who are weak, instead of just
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.880]   pointing fingers.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.040]   How do we learn patience?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.680]   How do we bring our family together so that we can be a greater witness for Christ?
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.920]   Fourth and finally, when done correctly, it proclaims the gospel until He comes.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   The word "proclaim," kata angelo, basically means "intense proclamation."
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:35.040]   It basically means to keep the major, major, and minor, minor, which means you and I have
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:39.800]   a tendency, every generation, and I've seen maybe about two or three huge movements come
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:45.200]   along just during the period that I've been a pastor, and every time these movements come,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.880]   people jump on board, "Oh, this is what the church needs to be.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.480]   This is what we have to do."
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.880]   The latest movement in our generation was the social justice movement, with all that
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.600]   was going around the world and saying, "We need to do this.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.800]   How come we're not doing this?"
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.200]   The problem wasn't that we should care for the poor.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.460]   Of course we should care for the poor.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:09.120]   Of course we should care about sex trafficking and all that has gone wrong.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:16.200]   But when that replaces the gospel, when the movement and what's going on around the world
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.240]   causes us to stray from the real power of God, all you've done is commit to put a band-aid
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   on cancer.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:32.000]   And the only answer to this fallen world is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.400]   Poverty exists because of sin.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.000]   Sex trafficking happens because of sin.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.880]   Racism happens because of sin.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.640]   Division happens because of sin.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.520]   War happens because of sin.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.120]   We're divided because of sin.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.960]   Family marriages break apart because of sin.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:52.560]   The core of every human suffering is sin, and the only power to deliver mankind from
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.840]   sin is the gospel.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.160]   Not politicians, not money, not better organization, not the right politicians in the right place,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.520]   but it's the power of God.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.880]   Foolishness to the world, to those who are perishing, but power of God for those who
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.520]   are being saved.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:22.280]   So the communion puts the gospel and constantly reminds us to put Christ at the center.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:33.200]   Love people, be generous, work, vote, do all of that thing, but never forget that the true
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:38.480]   power is in the blood and the body of Christ.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.440]   So this morning, as we participate in the communion table, as I ask the praise team
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:54.240]   to come up to prepare, I pray that you would take a few minutes to reflect.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.840]   Take every part of what you heard this morning seriously.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.640]   Have you come into this room this morning completely distracted?
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:07.520]   The thought of communion was the last thing on your mind?
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:13.000]   Let's get this over with, because I got an appointment, and you drifted, and Christ is
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.600]   not central.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:20.220]   To take some time to ask the Lord to get you focused on Christ, that maybe you've taken
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:25.360]   your eyes off of Him, or you have a hazy vision of who He is, to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.600]   Take this opportunity to ask the Lord that it would fix my eyes upon Christ, the author
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.200]   and perfecter of my faith.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.400]   When's the last time you prayed, "Search me and know me, try me and see if there's
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.000]   any anxious thoughts in me, and see if there's any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.320]   everlasting way."
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.400]   When's the last time you came before the Lord, not just asking to change your circumstance,
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:56.120]   but change your heart, change your attitude, change your perspective, change your compromise,
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.200]   things that you just kind of allowed.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:04.360]   Search me, Lord, see if there's any hurtful ways in me, and be ready to confess that and
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.280]   put that behind.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:15.560]   Is there bitterness, division, people you've stiff-armed, you've allowed, because you intensely
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:21.040]   love this person, that you excuse not loving the other person?
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:27.240]   Have one side of obedience, you've justified the disobedience on this other side?
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:34.560]   Is there division in your heart to come before the Lord, to participate in a worthy manner,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:41.200]   to recognize the whole body of Christ, not just the ones that you've selected?
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.000]   Is the gospel central?
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.560]   Is it truly central?
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.200]   Or is it just an addendum of your life?
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.060]   After you've done everything, after you've pursued everything, and then you sprinkle
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:00.000]   some Jesus on all of it, or is it central?
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.160]   Is what's major, major, minor, minor, or has that been flipped?
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.920]   Let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord and ask the Lord to let the communion
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.400]   have the effect that it was meant to have, and to revive our hearts, renew our hearts,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.820]   unite the church, and keep Christ centered.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.960]   So I'm going to give you a few minutes to pray, get ready, and then I'll call everybody
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.040]   together and we'll participate in the communion together.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.940]   So let's take some time to pray first.
