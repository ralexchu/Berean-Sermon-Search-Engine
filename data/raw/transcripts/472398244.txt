[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.360]   Good morning, church family.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.840]   My name is Peter, and I've been part of the family ministry here at Beroean for the last
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   12 years.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.240]   I'm married to my wonderful wife, Kelly, and we have three kids, Noel, Trevor, and Carter.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.480]   I have the privilege this morning of briefly sharing my testimony with you and to partake
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.240]   in the ordinance of baptism.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.760]   When I look back on my life, I see the gods and Indian faithfulness and care over my life.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.160]   At the age of seven, I moved to the US to live with my grandmother.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.920]   And not having my parents around throughout my childhood and teenage years, I was forced
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   to grow up quickly.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.520]   I learned to be independent, to make decisions on my own, both good and bad.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.360]   Looking back, it's only by God's grace and protection that I stayed away from trouble.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.360]   In high school, I hung out with the good kids, you know, the ones that didn't care much about
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.280]   girls or popularity as much as AP classes and GPAs.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.920]   And one good kid, Conrad, who would eventually become my closest friend, would always drag
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800]   me, I mean, invite me to his church.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   But Christianity was new to me, and this John 14.6 idea that Jesus is the only way to God
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.920]   ran counterintuitive to my Taiwanese culture of idol and ancestor worship and the common
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.520]   belief that all roads lead to one.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.160]   But slowly, God opened my eyes, exposing me more and more to his great love, to his church
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000]   and its people, and ultimately to the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.360]   Eventually, in 1999, as a junior in high school, I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.400]   It was during one of those harvest crusades at Angel Stadium.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200]   I still remember Pastor Greg Laurie saying, "If you feel Jesus tugging at your heart,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.760]   I invite you to come down to the field to respond in faith and to make a commitment
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   to him."
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.080]   In that moment, it was definitely the work of the Spirit drawing me, and before I knew
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   it, I was down in the field with hundreds of others, praying to receive Jesus as my
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Lord and Savior.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.520]   Praise God for that special day.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.320]   In the formative years of college, I attended an on-campus fellowship called AACF, where
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.080]   I found much-needed fellowship with other believers.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.960]   I found the prayer support I needed to navigate the ups and downs of college life.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.500]   And best of all, I found my future wife.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.240]   But in all seriousness, God truly sustained and deepened my faith and knowledge of him
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   during these years.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.880]   He opened my eyes even more to the truth of the gospel, to his holiness and my sinfulness,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.240]   to his amazing love and my desperate need for him.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.560]   It was during these crucial years that my theology shifted from a man-centered gospel
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   to a God-centered gospel.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.120]   It was no longer about me and my worth.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.480]   It was about God and glorifying him and enjoying making much of him forever.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   I learned that I was not the center of his redeeming work.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.920]   The magnifying of Christ in my life was the center of his redeeming work.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   And if I could narrow my college years down to one singular event that God used to change
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.080]   and shape me for the years to come, it would be hearing Pastor John Piper preach on God's
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.120]   holiness at the 2003 Passion Conference.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.920]   Based on the Isaiah 6 vision of the incomparable holiness of God, his sermon hit me like a
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   ton of bricks.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   Piper preached, "God's holiness is his infinite value as the absolutely unique, morally perfect,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.320]   permanent person that he is and who by grace has made himself accessible."
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.720]   It would be foolish of me to not pursue this God of infinite value, like in Philippians
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.320]   3.8 when Paul says, "I count all things as loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   Christ Jesus."
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.280]   In 2005, during my senior year of college, I was baptized at my old church, EFC Irvine,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   by the sprinkling of water.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.880]   I believed it to be sufficient, not questioning how it was performed.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.640]   In 2008, Kelly and I got married and we started coming to Bremen.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   It's been 12 years since.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.880]   If I could quickly, though unfairly, sum up the many lessons I've learned from the faithful
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.440]   preaching and study of God's word here, it's this, that there is nothing more valuable,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   more worthwhile than to pursue Christ above all things for my joy and for his glory.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.680]   To abide in Christ and his word where there is true life and to be anchored in Christ
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.920]   in order to stand firm in the midst of life's many storms and trials, all the while remaining
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   sober and alert, awaiting his return.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   I thank God for always, always for how our pastors and elders set a good example of this
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.880]   for us to follow.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.320]   They have impacted my life more than they know and more than they want to take credit
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.640]   for.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.840]   So why am I getting baptized now?
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.520]   Well, it's quite simple, to do what the Bible says in the way it says it.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.200]   In recent years, I thought more about the mode of baptism and it became clear to me
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.640]   that immersion was the expression of salvation shown in scripture.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   But my own pride prevented any further consideration or action.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.920]   I still held on to thinking that so long as my intentions were good, mode didn't matter.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.480]   But I'm thankful to our leaders who in this past year have really encouraged us to look
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.760]   at and study the scriptures and what it says regarding baptism and how it was practiced.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.560]   Thus, after much study, meditation, and prayer, I want to respond in obedience.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.760]   To be clear, it is by grace that I have been united to Christ through faith and justified
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.160]   by faith alone.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.200]   But if baptism is to signify this great union with Christ, especially in his death and resurrection,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.360]   then I want to honor him by doing so in the way that he has prescribed in his word.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.840]   To God be all the glory.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   Thank you.
