[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.960]   We're going to go ahead and get started with Bible study.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   So why don't we take a couple of moments
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.520]   to prepare our hearts for worship.

[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:12.320]   Father, we thank you for this opportunity to study your word.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.520]   We thank you so much for your word that it gives us--
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.160]   it allows us to learn more about you.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.560]   And it allows us to understand our value and our worth.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.600]   We just pray, Lord, as we come tonight,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   you give us humble hearts, teachable hearts
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.040]   to receive your word, that we would not only be hearers,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.760]   but doers, and live out your truth to those around us,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.560]   that you would use us as lights and your ambassadors
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.120]   to proclaim your name further.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.680]   So we thank you.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.760]   Would you give us strength if we're tired after a long day,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.600]   that we would offer you this time,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.520]   that it would be pleasing to you.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.120]   We love you.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   Pray all this in your name.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   Amen.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.800]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.240]   I have a maker.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   I have a maker.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   He forms my heart.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:54.200]   Before even time began, my life was in his hands.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   I have a maker.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   I have a maker.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   He forms my heart.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:21.160]   Before even time began, my life was in his hands.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.640]   He knows my name.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:39.640]   He knows my every thought.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:49.120]   He sees each tear that falls, and hears me when I call.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   I have a father.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.600]   I have a father.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   He calls me his own.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   He'll never leave me, no matter where I go.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   He knows my name.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   He knows my name.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.560]   He knows my every thought.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:48.040]   He sees each tear that falls, and he hears me when I call.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   He knows my name.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.040]   He knows my every thought.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:15.520]   He sees each tear that falls, and he hears me when I call.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   He hears me when I call.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   He hears me when I call.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   I give you my soul.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   I live for you alone.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   I wake every moment I'm awake.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   This is my desire.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   This is my desire to honor you.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   Lord, with all my heart, I worship you.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   All I have within me, I give you in praise.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   All that I adore is in you.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   I give you my soul.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   I live for you alone.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   This is my desire.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   This is my desire to honor you.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   Lord, with all my heart, I worship you.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   Lord, with all my heart, I worship you.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   All I have within me, I give you in praise.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   All that I adore is in you.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:48.520]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   I give you my soul.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   I live for you alone.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:06.520]   Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   Lord, I give you my heart.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.520]   I give you my soul.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.520]   I live for you alone.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   Lord, have your way in me.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Amen.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   All right.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.520]   Well, good evening, everybody.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.520]   As we all get settled down, let me--I'll give you about 15
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   seconds, and then I'm going to pray and get us started.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:40.520]   Let's pray together.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   Lord, it's easy to assume that for many of us in this room
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   that that song we just sang was probably difficult to sing.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   And if we're honest, we don't want you to have your way in
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   our hearts, for if all of us did, our worship would be a lot
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   more vibrant.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.520]   Our lives would look different.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   It is our confession, Father, that our flesh is very weak,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   easily entangled, and there is a constant tension wanting you,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   yet at the same time, wanting the things of this world.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   And I know that that plagues every person to varying degrees.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   And it is our confession that it's not effort or zeal that can
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   fix that.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:15.520]   It is our confession that it really is just all your grace.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, and we ask for
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   your kindness today in our Bible study, in our small group time,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   in our learning, and that as we learn how to better abide in
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   you, that in your time you would bear fruit in our lives.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   Help us not to just study the Bible tonight just to learn
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   more, but help us really to feed off it.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   So we entrust our time into your hands, knowing that you are
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   faithful, and would you allow, God, your word really to sharpen
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   and grow our hearts, and if need be, first break and humble.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.520]   So we thank you, Lord, for just this time that you've given us
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   to look into your word.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.520]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   I'm going to read the first 11 verses of chapter 5 to you.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520]   We're almost done.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   We've got 14 verses left.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   We're doing 7 today, and we're looking at 7 next week.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   Chapter 5, verse 5 on, it kind of is another little section, but
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   we're breaking off today at 7.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.520]   So I'm going to read all 11 verses for you.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.520]   So follow along with your eyes and your ears.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.520]   "Therefore I exhort the elders among you as your fellow elder
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.520]   and witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker also of
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.520]   the glory that is to be revealed.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.520]   Shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.520]   under compulsion but voluntarily according to the will of God,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   not for sordid gain but with eagerness, nor yet as lording it
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   over those allotted to your charge but proving to be
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   examples to the flock.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   unfading crown of glory.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   You younger men likewise be subject to your elders, and all
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.520]   of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another for
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Therefore humble yourselves into the mighty hand of God that he
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   on him because he cares for you.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.520]   Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   seeking someone to devour, but resist him firm in your faith
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   knowing that the same experiences of suffering are
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.520]   After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   To him be dominion forever and ever.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   Amen.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.520]   So you guys have been here.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   This is our 16th week.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   We've got two weeks left, today and next week.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   So you know the first two questions.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   Number three is just in light of the growing hostilities, what
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   were Peter's instructions to those in the church?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   And there are two specific groups and then one, I guess,
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   collective that he's speaking to.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.520]   So go ahead and do that and then at 820 we'll resume for our
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.520]   time of wrap-up.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.520]   All right?
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.520]   820.

[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.520]   All right, let's gather back together.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   If I can have you guys wrap up your final thoughts,
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.520]   and then slowly turn your attention up to the front.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.520]   I pray, Father help us to understand clearly
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.520]   how you would have us to apply these truths in your Word.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   I pray that you would give us wisdom and discernment
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   as we grow in knowledge. And as we grow in wisdom,
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.520]   Lord would you fill our hearts with greater humility and love.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.520]   I pray all these things in Jesus' name.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.520]   Let me start with just some
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   just outline related stuff that I want to just put up here for you.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:22.520]   So normally I'll just start out with like the red words,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   kind of the important words that I feel like are kind of hinge words
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   that help me understand the meaning. And there are two therefores in there.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.520]   And if you guys remember what we looked at in chapter four
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   is a lot of suffering, right? And we're looking at today,
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   there's all these instructions for church life.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.520]   And the connection is this.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   When there's chaos, when there's rampant pain,
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   persecution, some degrees of suffering,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.520]   and things don't make sense.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   The natural tendency for people is to blame and to point fingers.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:13.520]   Right? You leaders are not handling this well.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   You leaders are responsible for the gas prices going up.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.520]   You guys have basically cost the lives of these children who died.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.520]   You guys are the reasons why it's just, right?
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.520]   The previous administration, and then the previous administration says,
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   the previous administration, everybody is quick to blame.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   And there's a reason why I feel like younger men specifically are called out.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Because younger men have fire. Like, we need to, you know,
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   these old fogies, they don't know what they're doing.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.520]   We need to take charge. So human nature always sees
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.520]   that our struggle is against flesh and blood.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.520]   But reality-wise is our struggle is not against flesh and blood, right?
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   But against the principalities, against the spiritual forces of evil,
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.520]   against the forces of darkness.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.520]   So this is an instruction with a therefore on church life
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   to people in the midst of chaos.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.520]   So that you understand how to do life, a normal Christian life,
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.520]   in the midst of chaos, and letting God sort it all out.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Okay? So that's the, so here are three, two groups that are addressed,
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.520]   and that's all in the purple. Elders and younger men.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   And then all of you is everybody. Those are the three groups.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:43.520]   And with each group, there is a command there.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   So that's the yellow. Do your eyes go there? You see it?
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   So for the elders, the verb is to shepherd.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.520]   Okay? In the King James it says to feed, but it's to shepherd.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:03.520]   To young men, as it said to all citizens, to slaves, to wives,
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.520]   it's the same word. Be subject.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:11.520]   And then to elders and young men, to everybody in the church,
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:17.520]   there are two imperatives there. It's to clothe and to humble.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.520]   And even with clothe, what do you clothe yourself with?
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.520]   Humility. Not with more strategy, not with more greater organization,
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.520]   not more with like data, it's be humble.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.520]   Okay? So those are the yellow imperatives, or the imperatives.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   And then the other stuff I'll let you look at when you get these,
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   when you can download them from the internet. Okay?
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.520]   So here are three take-home truths from chapter 5, verses 1 through 7.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.520]   And here's the first one.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:01.520]   Christ-like shepherding is done through the joy-filled exercising of oversight,
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.520]   compassionate stewardship, and faithful modeling of Christian living.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   Why do I get this super nerdy, long, awkward sentence?
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:16.520]   It's... Do you see the underlined participles there?
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.520]   So this is what shepherding entails.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   Okay?
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.520]   Christ-like shepherding is done through joy-filled exercising of oversight,
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   compassionate stewardship, and faithful modeling of Christian living.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   How many of you guys know that there was recently a report published
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   centering around the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest denomination,
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   with hundreds of cases of abuse?
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.520]   Okay?
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:57.520]   Yeah, that's a very damaging report.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   And the problem, I don't think is denominational,
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.520]   because Southern Baptist just is the largest denomination in the world.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   But it's kind of what plagues every denomination in every church.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.520]   The SBC only gets the attention because it's big.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   But I think our generation, one of the biggest problems of churchianity today
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   is that leaders are placed way too quickly.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.520]   The wrong people are placed way too quickly in leadership.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   Would you guys... I'm not sure if you would kind of agree with that.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   And that's why it takes a long time to raise up a leader,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520]   to test a leader, to train a leader.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.520]   And the common element of every spiritual leader that's qualified
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:57.520]   really should be terror, humility, and love.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   You need a leader who's biblically literate, true or false.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.520]   Yeah, because the leader is saying, "Thus saith the Lord."
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   If the leader has no idea what the Lord is saying,
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]   he shouldn't be talking.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520]   Okay?
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.520]   But if you have a biblically literate spiritual leader,
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.520]   he's going to be a combination of humility, terror, and love.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   Interesting juxtaposition.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   And that leader, in every step of his ministry, as he grows,
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.520]   you're going to see a growth in greater humility and disgust with himself,
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.520]   terror before a holy, holy, holy God,
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.520]   but a great compassion toward people.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   But usually when we select leaders now in churches,
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.520]   those who get the most notoriety...
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.520]   Sorry, notoriety is the wrong word.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.520]   Fame are the gifted people.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.520]   The exceptionally gifted.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520]   Right?
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:03.520]   So, one of the biggest admonitions from this chapter for the leaders
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   is Christ-like shepherding.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.520]   And Christ-like shepherding...
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   Actually, you know why that command and that exhortation to not under compulsion?
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   Because this calling for leadership should be a super heavy one for every elder in the church.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.520]   Where there's almost like, "I don't want to do this anymore!"
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.520]   Because it's so heavy a burden.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.520]   These people are not easy to love.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.520]   But I need to not love them with just a fleshly, like, human-empowered love?
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.520]   I need to love them like Christ loved...
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   That is a high call.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   And I need to model for the flock,
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.520]   "Holy, holy, holy living?
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.520]   Who is up to this task?"
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.520]   So every spiritual leader who is real and authentic
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.520]   should have a desire to leave it.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   But that's why that admonition is there.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   Not under compulsion, but willingly.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.520]   You take up your cross daily.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.520]   So, not lording it over the flock.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   You know, the lording it over the flock is not the problem, that's the symptom.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   So when you look at verses 1-4,
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   you can immediately apply that as prayer requests for the leaders at this church.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   That we would persevere in that.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.520]   Especially as the church is growing.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.520]   You know, one thing on Saturday, this past Saturday,
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.520]   we have a Saturday leaders meeting every week.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.520]   You guys know that, right?
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   This week we're just praying for different things.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.520]   And Pastor Peter prayed something that just caught my attention.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.520]   And this is what he prayed.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:56.520]   He said, "Lord, help us not to touch your glory,
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   but help us to stay out of the way."
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:08.520]   And I know he's prayed that many times in front of, in my presence, before.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:14.520]   But for some reason this past Saturday, kind of, "Huh, why did he pray that?"
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   "Help us not to touch your glory, and help us to stay out of the way."
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   And I was like, "Maybe the fruit that's coming out of this ministry
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.520]   is because of a prayer of a leader like that."
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.520]   Who is like deathly terrified to touch any of the credit.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   So keep praying that the leaders of the church
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.520]   are those who are seeking to shepherd well.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520]   Amen?
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:59.520]   Secondly, the take-home truth that we can get from here is
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   all believers are called to pursue the grace of God.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   Which is kind of weird, because how do you pursue grace?
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   It's a free gift. "I want it!" Right?
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.520]   How do you pursue that? But that's what the text is saying.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520]   Pursue it.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.520]   Because God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520]   Okay?
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.520]   And there is a multiple call for humility here.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.520]   Clothe yourself with humility and humble yourself, right?
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520]   You guys notice that?
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.520]   So we're called to actively pursue humility.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   Think about that.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.520]   What does that look like?
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.520]   If I were to say, "Sarah, be humble."
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.520]   What's she going to say?
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520]   "Dude, I totally am."
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   Is that what she...
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   Do you realize humility is not something that you attain through effort?
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Nod your heads if you understand that.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520]   Is humility something you attain through effort? Yes or no?
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520]   No.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.520]   So I feel like it's important to define what humility is
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   from kind of a biblical definition,
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.520]   so that we would know how to pursue it.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:17.520]   So let me take a little moment to go through what it is not.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.520]   So what humility is not.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.520]   The first one,
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:27.520]   humility is not an external show or pretense.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.520]   Colossians 2 calls it false humility,
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.520]   or the more literal translations actually call it self-abasement.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.520]   "Oh no, I am not worthy."
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.520]   Like some people talk like that.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.520]   Especially in Korea, they talk about that all the time.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.520]   That's how you introduce yourself.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.520]   "Oh, this presentation is so poorly done, but please pay attention to it."
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.520]   "Oh, this meal totally sucks. I didn't cook. It doesn't taste good, but please have some."
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.520]   That's a weird Asian trait, right?
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.520]   "No, no. Oh, you sing so well."
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.520]   "No, I don't. I suck."
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   "And why did you do special praise?"
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.520]   That's just part of our culture.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.520]   But that's not humility.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520]   Would you guys agree with that?
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520]   Humility is not a pretense of,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   "Oh no."
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520]   That's not humility. Got it?
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.520]   So if you're good at something, be okay with being good at it.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   You don't need to pretend that it's no good.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.520]   It is also not an inferiority complex.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   Inferiority complex is broken pride.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   It's wounded pride.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.520]   Would you agree?
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.520]   "I'm not as good as that guy."
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   That's not humility.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   That's your pride kind of saddened.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.520]   Moses was the humblest man on the face of the planet.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   It says in the book of Exodus and Numbers.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   At the burning bush,
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.520]   was he humble or was he arrogant?
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520]   That man was arrogant.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.520]   Because God's anger,
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   it says, burned against him.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.520]   In Exodus chapter 4.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.520]   Because what was Moses doing?
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.520]   "No, I haven't. I can't. I am not a good talker."
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   Acts 7.22, he was trained up in all the wisdom.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.520]   And he was powerful in speech and in action.
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Acts 7.22.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   He's like, "I can't. I've just been feeding sheep for 40 years.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   Don't send me. Send someone else."
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   And he engages with God that way
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   to where God's anger, it says, burns.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.520]   You guys following that?
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.520]   That's not where he was humble.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.520]   He was proud there.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   Because if you had sent me when I was 40, Lord,
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.520]   I would have been good.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.520]   But now at 80, 40 years of not using a language, you forget.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.520]   So that's it. Inferiority complex is not humility.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.520]   Third, a gentle and quiet personality.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   We know gentle and quiet people who are super stubborn,
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.520]   super not humble.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.520]   This has nothing to do with personality.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   So Ephesians 5.11, it's these gentle folk
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520]   that actually don't speak out when they should.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   So a quiet and gentle personality.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   So trying to become more humble doesn't mean you're always just like,
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.520]   "Okay, I just shouldn't talk at all."
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   No, because then we'd have a really boring Bible study.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520]   "Oh, that'll let other people speak."
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.520]   Humility is not about just being more quiet.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.520]   Although it helps.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:30.520]   Lastly, humility is not cowardice or passivity.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   1 Samuel 17, David, the youngest son,
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   is sent on an errand from his dad to take food to his brothers.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.520]   How many of you guys are familiar with this story?
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.520]   When he's there, he sees Goliath spewing forth offenses.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   And he's like, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine?
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   How dare he?"
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   Eliab, his oldest brother, you know what he actually says at that moment?
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   "You're arrogant."
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   No, but that's actually David being so humble.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.520]   "I am so offended that this uncircumcised pagan giant dude
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   would dare say such things about my God."
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   And where everyone else is shuddering in fear,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.520]   Goliath's like, "Let me at him."
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   He is humble here.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.520]   He is not passive here.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   John the Baptist, we've been learning about him on Sundays
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.520]   a little bit of his...
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   when he's in the womb, actually.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   Is he... you know what?
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.520]   John 3, 31, humanly, is so offensive.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   He must increase, I must decrease.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.520]   Was John a coward?
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.520]   Was he passive?
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   He gets beheaded for speaking out against one of the Herods.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   You guys know that story, right?
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.520]   Humility is not cowardice or passivity.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:17.520]   And sometimes, humility actually gets mistaken for arrogance.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   You guys understand how that can happen?
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   "Who do you think you are?"
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.520]   Is a lot of times how that's interpreted.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   "Dude, don't rock the boat."
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.520]   So this is what humility is, okay?
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   It's not something we necessarily achieve through human effort.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:41.520]   But what it is, is the attitude that results from putting God in his rightful place
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   and then in turn, us kind of getting out of the way.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.520]   You guys following this?
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:58.520]   The attitude that results from putting God in his rightful place.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:04.520]   And that runs throughout the course of 1 Peter 4 especially and 5.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   If God is all powerful, all good, all worthy of trust,
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:21.520]   I just need to follow him and not complain or grumble or be anxious.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:29.520]   Even though Satan, next week, verse 8, he's prowling around like a hungry, roaring lion,
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   I don't need to fear him.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.520]   Because God is God.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:43.520]   But if he's my father, he's his father, he's her father, he's his father,
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:50.520]   I need to steward these relationships not with condescending attitude just because I'm more experienced
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520]   or I think I'm smarter than everybody else.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   But I need to steward these relationships in love.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.520]   Because we all have one father, one Lord, one spirit.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:11.520]   So if God is God in my life, my interaction with everybody around me,
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.520]   Christian and non-Christian, but especially to those in the church, as it says in Galatians 6,
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.520]   I'm going to be so kind and compassionate and yet not cowardly.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   So humility is not something we necessarily achieve through human effort,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.520]   it is the attitude that results from putting God in his rightful place.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.520]   So when it says clothe yourself with humility, it's not saying put on an act.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:44.520]   It's saying figure out a proper theology of who God is and who you are not.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.520]   Does that make sense?
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:56.520]   Because once we figure that out, as a Christian, your view of self should go down every year
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.520]   because you are just dirty.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   Your view of God should go higher, higher every year because he is holy, holy, holy,
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:09.520]   and even holier than I had ever imagined him to be.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.520]   Where I am really unworthy.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.520]   But man, he loves me.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.520]   And my desire is simply to please him.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.520]   And I want to be like him.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.520]   He loves wretched people, I want to do the same.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:30.520]   That's what clothing myself in humility should look like as I progress in my faith.
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   Not lording it over those who are farther behind me,
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:40.520]   but just being patient and watch, because do I have control over any of your hearts?
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.520]   No.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:48.520]   Even if I strive to be the best pastor that I possibly could,
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.520]   I will make a very little impact in your life.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.520]   It's all God.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.520]   I'm just called a steward and when he says go, I go.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.520]   When he says speak, I speak.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.520]   When he says sit, I sit.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:02.520]   That's all I am.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.520]   Because there's one chief shepherd.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.520]   I'm an under shepherd, or I actually like to call it, I'm a sheep dog.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.520]   Just get pet when they need some comfort.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.520]   And if they need a little bit of extra encouragement,
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.520]   and just for the rest of my time, and just be jolly.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.520]   Okay?
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.520]   I don't know if Pastor Nate would ever be mistaken for a sheep dog, but me, that might work.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.520]   Okay?
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.520]   Third, take home truth.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:33.520]   In every season and circumstance, trust and obey, because there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.520]   And that's this passage.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   I find myself very discouraged by the affairs of the world.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   There's another shooting today.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.520]   Right?
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   And as soon as something happens, something shows up on the media,
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:56.520]   you got all kinds of people chiming in with all kinds of, this is their fault, this is your fault, this is your fault.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520]   We can fix it like this.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.520]   It's like, duh, you don't see it, you're so dumb.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.520]   You guys just need to calm down that the problem is not in, let's say, a denomination.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.520]   It's all over the place.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:18.520]   Can you cure racism and greed and stupidity out of a person's heart by legislation?
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520]   No, you cannot.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:26.520]   The only way you can change a person is by changing their heart, and the only way to do that is by the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:31.520]   My instinct tells me to blame somebody.
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:40.520]   But as I walk by faith and not by sight, I'm reminded my struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.520]   So I need to pray.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:49.520]   So trust and obey, and be active in your trusting and obedience.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.520]   Okay?
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.520]   So hopefully you guys, that doesn't sound like a political statement, right?
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   This is what the scripture is telling me to do in my application in my life.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.520]   So this is, next week, we're done after next week.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.520]   You guys should not celebrate.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.520]   I'm actually kind of up like, yay!
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.520]   Because I'm like, oh!
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.520]   But next week we're done.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.520]   17th week of 1 Peter, we're done.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.520]   8 through 14.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.520]   But if you can this week, circle back all the way to verse 1.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.520]   Go through the 105 verses.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.520]   Just go through it again.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.520]   And then perhaps, take note of the three most significant themes in the letter.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:42.520]   Okay, now that we've almost heard suffering every week, fear a lot, about humility and God's sovereignty often,
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.520]   be subject, be subject, be subject, that's come up.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.520]   So what are the three most significant ones that catch your eye?
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.520]   And then, maybe write a one sentence summary of 1 Peter.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.520]   And if you did that before you studied this thing, maybe the sentence will be different.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.520]   So kind of try that as a little wrap-up exercise in addition to the last seven verses.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:09.520]   Tonight, what are the ways in which you can better support and pray for the shepherds in your church?
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.520]   So my encouragement is, hey, perfect time to just apply this.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   Pray through this.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.520]   Help PPC not to be lording it over those entrusted to his care.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]   Right?
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.520]   Help Pastor Mark not to shepherd under compulsion, but with eagerness.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520]   You could pray all of this.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.520]   Because we will wrestle with all of these things.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.520]   Okay?
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.520]   Help all the pastors not to be fond of sordid gain.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.520]   Whatever it is, pray for those things.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.520]   And then, what are the areas of pride in your life?
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.520]   Because remember, God is opposed to that.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520]   AKA hate.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.520]   He hates pride.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:55.520]   So what are the areas of pride in your life that are hindering your relationship not just with God, but with others?
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.520]   I think a lot of times people say, "Oh, I can't believe that God is good."
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.520]   And that's more their pride than their ability to see the evidence.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520]   Right?
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.520]   Three, what are the anxieties in your life that you need to cast on the Lord?
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.520]   How can your group members pray for you and keep you accountable to those things?
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.520]   So, we're going to reconvene next week.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:23.520]   Spend the remainder of your time together in your groups just praying for these things.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.520]   And then, we'll call it a night.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   Alright?
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   Amen.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   Amen.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:41.520]   [Prayer is sounded]
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.940]   Thank you.
