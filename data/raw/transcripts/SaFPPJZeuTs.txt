[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.000]   Father, you are worthy of praise and worthy of all glory
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and honor.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And Lord, we sing and we proclaim that we depend on you.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   We need thee every hour.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Lord, we need your grace and your mercy every hour.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.500]   And Lord, for all who confess and call upon your name,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   we know that you give and you show mercy
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.000]   and you give and you show grace.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And Lord, we know in Christ we are truly free from the curse
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   of sin, from anything that binds us to hell.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.500]   We are free in Christ.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   So we thank you.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   We worship you.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.000]   We lift up your name.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.500]   We pray that the word that goes forth and studied today
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.000]   may it be rooted in our hearts and may it
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.500]   translate to giving you worship in spirit
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.000]   and in truth in our actions and in our thoughts.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.500]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.000]   Amen.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Well, good evening.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.500]   Before we get into the text, just a word of caution
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   for tonight, because we are actually
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   going into a passage that has so much to do with our testimony
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.000]   and our identity.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.500]   I feel like tonight actually should
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   feel like Good Friday service, right?
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.000]   Where on Good Friday in the Passion Week,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.500]   when we have it at church, everyone's coming very somber,
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.000]   very eager to reflect on the death of our Lord
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and for our sins.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.500]   And Easter hasn't come yet, but we have that sobriety
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   on a Good Friday.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   And so as we look at this text, just the weightiness
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.500]   should feel like that.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.000]   So my word of caution is that we don't treat this just
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   like an academic exercise tonight,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   as much as there are Old Testament passages
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.500]   that we need to look at.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   It's very fascinating.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.000]   You can end up in rabbit holes of what's
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   being shared in the law and the prophets and stuff like that.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.500]   But at the end of the day, if you're a Christian,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.500]   we're looking at the cost and the price of our redemption.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.000]   And so my hope is that each and every one of us,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.500]   this really stirs within us greater affection,
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   that this isn't just like, oh, Bible study,
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.000]   oh, when is it going to be done?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   But we're looking at the God of the universe
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   dying on our behalf.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.500]   And so I want to read this passage and then pray for us.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   And I'm going to take it back a little bit to verse 6.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.000]   "Even so, Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   as righteousness.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   are sons of Abraham.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   The scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.500]   saying, all the nations will be blessed in you.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.000]   So then, those who are of faith are blessed
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   with Abraham, the believer.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   for it is written, cursed is everyone who does not abide
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.500]   by all things written in the book of the law to perform them.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.500]   Now, that no one is justified by law before God is evident,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   for the righteous man shall live by faith.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   However, the law is not of faith.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.000]   having become a curse for us.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.500]   For it is written, cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.000]   might come to the Gentiles, so that you and I also would
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.500]   receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   So, here are the questions for tonight.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   What does it mean to be cursed by God?
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   What does it mean to be blessed by God?
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   And the more you dive into the curse,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   the more the gospel becomes good news, right?
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   So, take your time with that.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   And three, what is this curse of the law?
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   And what's the relationship between Abraham and the Spirit?
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.500]   And like I shared before, don't treat this just as academics.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.000]   Treat this as your ransom having been paid, okay?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.500]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll reconvene at 8 o'clock,
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   or at 810.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:48.000]   Father, help us tonight really to appreciate deeply
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.500]   this passage that speaks about the change of our eternity,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   which speaks of the great cost that you paid.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   And Lord, I pray the great reward that we have,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   simply because we believe.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   I pray that every single one of us, as we dive into this text,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   will leave here not just astonished, but humbled and grateful.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.000]   Would you remove from us every ounce of grumbling?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Would you take away from us every desire to boast?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Would you remove from each and every one of us,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   as we dive into your word, complacency?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Would you feed our souls and ignite our hearts afresh tonight
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   through your word?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I'm going to pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   Can someone from the AV team switch--it got unlinked.
