[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   (people chattering)
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   (people chattering)
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   (people chattering)
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.960]   - All right, everybody.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   It may be a little bit ringing.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   There you go, thank you.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   We've created our table there,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.460]   and then we'll do our review.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.960]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.960]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for your grace,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   and Lord, we continue to just pray and ask of you
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   that, Lord, as we try to study and learn,
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   we know, God, that it's one thing
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   to simply understand the passage,
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.960]   and it's another thing to spiritually feel the conviction,
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.960]   to have a vision for sanctification in our lives,
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   and to live in such a way where,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   God, all the truths that we see,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   and the way that even you see the world,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   for us to see it the same way.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   I pray, God, then, for your Spirit's empowerment,
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   Spirit illumination, and conviction of the heart.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960]   Okay, so,
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.960]   remember, each week, I try to do just like a,
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   here's a flow of thought leading into the passage,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   talking about how those who are living in the Spirit,
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   we're expected to really be able to care for one another
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   in such a way that we restore one another,
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   that it's going to be a fruit of the Spirit
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   to be able to love those who are even burdened by sin, okay?
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   Those even burdened by guilt.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   And then, the previous passage,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   it challenged us to share all good things,
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   and then to know that those who sow into the flesh
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   will reap from the flesh,
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   and those who sow into the Spirit will reap from the Spirit.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   And he said, do not be mocked.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   God is going to do this,
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   where the consequences of our actions are there, right?
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   And so, he challenged us to do good,
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   to not get weary, to not get discouraged,
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   but to make sure we're persevering to do good.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   And then, for today, we have then a passage
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   where he goes back, you know, the whole book,
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   there are specific moments when he laid it on thick
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   against those who are teaching false doctrine.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   From the very start of the letter, actually, he said,
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   "Man, if anybody, whether angel or any man,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   "preaches a gospel different than ours,
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   "let him be anathema."
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   Well, he goes back to describe these people,
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   and these people are not sowing in the flesh,
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   but showing in the flesh.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   It says here, "See what large letters I am writing,"
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.960]   thank you, "I am writing to you with my own hand,
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   "those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   "who try to compel you to be circumcised,
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.960]   "simply so that they will not be persecuted
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   "for the cross of Christ.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   "For those who are circumcised
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.960]   "do not even keep the law themselves,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.960]   "but they desire to have you circumcised
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   "so that they may boast in your flesh.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   "But may it never be that I would boast
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   "except on the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   "through which the Lord has been crucified to me
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   "and I to the world.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.960]   "For neither is circumcision anything,
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   "nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   When I look at this passage,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.960]   I'm looking at essentially three movements again.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.960]   This very first portion,
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   he's just calling for our attention.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:24.960]   Verse 12 through 13, describing those.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   Going over here real fast to the highlighter.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   Describing those.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   And then over here, in contrast,
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   he describes his own heart.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   He describes his own attitude
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   and his own convictions
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   that he would never boast in anything
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.960]   except the cross of our Lord.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.960]   So we have verse 14 and 15
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   then describing the centrality of salvation in Christ.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   In summary then, you have it like this.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   Verse 11, listen up.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.960]   Verse 12 through 13, motivations of the false teachers.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   And then verse 14 through 15,
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   boasting in Christ alone, okay?
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   All right, just by way of this first portion of it,
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   you know, when we think about what he's saying here,
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   see with large letters.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960]   I mean, you could do the inductive questions of like,
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   hmm, why was he writing extra large?
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   And why does he say I'm writing to you?
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   And you have maybe like did some research
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   on the fact that certain other letters he dictates
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   and he has the people who are his confidants
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   and assistants, et cetera, be writing for him, et cetera.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   But he describes this element
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   that I am speaking to you personally
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   and essentially it's three iterations of the same thing,
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   which is listen to me, right?
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.960]   And it reminds us of the tone of the letter, okay?
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   The tone of the letter here that we have
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   is one of urgent reminder.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.960]   In some sense, we can look at the book of Galatians
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   and say it's been pretty repetitive, right?
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   I mean, paragraph to paragraph,
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   sometimes he makes the point,
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   then he gives us the example,
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.960]   then he shows us how it showed up in the scriptures,
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   and then he pushes you again, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   just reminding us that when we think about
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   the context of this letter,
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   we have to be thinking he is trying to spare people
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   from falling from grace.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   He's trying to win people
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.960]   from an absolutely damning religion,
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   which is that of going back to slavery, right?
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   So it reminds us that the tone of the letter
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   was very serious.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.960]   It reminds us that the tone of the letter
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   was something that if you put it in context,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   he saw as enemies of the gospel
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960]   pursuing his children.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   And then we would ask,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   so then, of all the things that Apostle Paul is saying,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   and even now going into the segment
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   where he's essentially calling out
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   and identifying, and yes, condemning
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   the motives of the false teachers,
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   we can see why, right?
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   If any one of us had our own children
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   be pursued by someone with vile intentions,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   we would have the same tone.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   So then, we go to the center part
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960]   of what he's saying in our paragraph,
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   and he talks about those who desire,
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   and so we see that he is talking about
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   their motives, okay?
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   And so we would ask the question,
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   what are the people doing?
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   Who is he talking about?
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   What are they trying to do?
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   And I would highlight for you
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   that he is identifying the various things
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960]   they're trying to achieve
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   as the intentions of their heart, okay?
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   So, one, it says,
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.960]   those who desire to make a good showing
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.960]   in the flesh, okay?
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   So that's just one,
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   that they're trying to make a good impression.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   And in order to accomplish that,
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   that's why they're trying to get them circumcised.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   And they do this simply so that what?
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   They will not be persecuted.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.960]   So that's the second one.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.960]   Their motivation is to avoid
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   the consequences of actually following Christ.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960]   And then, verse 13, it says,
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   for those who are uncircumcised
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   do not even keep the law describing their hypocrisy.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   So that's just the descriptive element
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   of what happens when your intentions are like this.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   But in terms of their desire,
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   they desire to have you circumcised.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:23.960]   Why?
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960]   Because they want to boast, okay?
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   So, in summary,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   they have three things that they're trying to do.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960]   They're trying to look good,
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   they're trying to avoid persecution,
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   and they're trying to boast in your flesh, okay?
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   So, in thinking about that a little bit,
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   you know, we sometimes try to
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   highlight certain specific terms and verbs.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   But for the first one,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   in terms of trying to look good,
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   what's really interesting is
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   it's just simply talking about two words
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   where you put on a good face, okay?
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.960]   And I found that to be, you know,
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.960]   quite convicting just from the definition
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   in terms of sometimes the pattern
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   by which we even behave ourselves.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.960]   And we know from this passage,
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   again, in verse 13,
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   that anybody who is just simply
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   trying to put on an external image,
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   you're always going to have what?
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   Hypocrisy.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   Why?
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   Because whatever you're doing
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   doesn't rise from principle,
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   it doesn't rise from what's good.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   It simply arises in the situation
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   what makes me look good, right?
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   What makes me look good?
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   And so this is why we get so angry
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   about topics like politics, et cetera.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   In some sense,
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   not only should we all care about politics,
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   but we should be voting for individuals
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   who genuinely care about policy.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   If the intention of their heart
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   was to actually legislate laws
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   that were fair, good,
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   laws that were actually, you know,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   good for the country, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.960]   then that's actually something noble.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   But it's been always perverted.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   Why?
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.960]   Because it became typically a play for power,
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   position, prestige, and legacy.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   And when that's the case,
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   that's when the term plain politics
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   gets really, really dirty
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   because what ends up happening
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   is then it's all about media, image,
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   getting a certain word out,
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   getting a certain mantra, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   And we all know from our own just hearts
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   when we see that,
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   it becomes despicable, right?
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   And so for us,
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   just take a moment
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.960]   to turn your Bible over to Matthew 6 for us.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   It brings us to a moment of just conviction.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.960]   And we've actually talked about this
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   in previous lessons,
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   but the conviction that there is,
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   if we are honest,
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   a regular, regular meaning,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   it just happens so frequently,
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   temptation to fake it.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   And Jesus had this command.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   It's interesting that within your Bibles,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   it may even just kind of highlight
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   instructions about prayer,
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   instructions about the poor,
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   but actually his instruction
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   is not specifically about prayer or the poor.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   His instruction is about
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   how we present ourselves, right?
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   So turn your Bible there
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   'cause I'm gonna read a little bit more
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   than what I have.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   So in verse one of Matthew chapter six,
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   it says, "Beware of practicing
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   "your righteousness before men
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   "to be noticed by them.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960]   "Otherwise you have no reward
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   "with your Father who is in heaven."
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960]   Right?
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.960]   Verse two, "So when you give to the poor,
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   "do not sound the trumpet before you
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   "as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   "and in the streets
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   "so that they may be honored by men.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   "Truly I say to you,
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   "they have their reward in full."
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:43.960]   And another situation is,
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960]   "But when you give to the poor,
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   "do not let your left hand
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.960]   "know what your right hand is doing
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   "so that your giving will be in secret
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.960]   "and your Father who sees what is done
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   "in secret will reward you.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960]   "So when you pray,
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   "you are not to be like the hypocrites
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   "for they love to stand and pray
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   "in the synagogues and on the street corners
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.960]   "so that they may be seen by men.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   "Truly I say to you,
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.960]   "they have their reward in full.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   "But you, when you pray,
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   "go into your inner room,
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   "close your door and pray
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   "to your Father who is in secret
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   "and your Father who sees what is done
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.960]   "in secret will reward you.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   "And when you pray,
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.960]   "do not use meaningless repetition
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   "as the Gentiles do
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   "for they suppose
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   "that they will be heard
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   "for their many words.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   "Do not be like them
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   "for your Father knows what you need
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   "before you ask Him."
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   And then if you scroll your eyes down
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   as he gives an example
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.960]   of how you ought to pray,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   verse 16,
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   "Whenever you fast,
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   "do not put on a gloomy face
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   "as the hypocrites do
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   "for they neglect their appearances
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   "so that they will be noticed by men
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   "when they are fasting.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:49.960]   "Truly I say to you,
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.960]   "they have their reward in full."
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   So here we have such a convicting passage
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960]   from the book of Matthew
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   where our Lord knew
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   that in the regular practice
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.960]   of disciplines that are actually good,
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   there is such a danger for perversion.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   Just good disciplines
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.960]   all used as a showcase
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   for our own self-righteousness, right?
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   What a danger for us.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   And the thing about it is
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.960]   we recognize that it is very difficult
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.960]   to get yourself out of that mode.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   How difficult is it for you
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   to not care about somebody watching you?
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   How difficult is it to not care
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   about somebody noticing you?
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   As a matter of fact,
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   that, just that simple thing,
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.960]   did somebody notice what I did?
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960]   Did somebody appreciate what I did?
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   Did somebody, you know,
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   Does this benefit anybody?
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   All of these questions
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   become incredibly, incredibly heavy for us.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   So just from thinking about
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960]   the motivations of these false teachers,
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.960]   what a brief point of conviction.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   But the other that we looked at
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   is the motivation to avoid persecution,
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   to avoid persecution.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   Now, all I'm going to say is
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   essentially Apostle Paul
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   is 100% calling these false teachers out
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   and saying, "These guys are cowards."
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.960]   And what's actually sad about this situation
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.960]   is one, in humility, we too, right?
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.960]   We too can take a moment of humility
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   and say we are susceptible to temptation
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   where if somebody is judging us,
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   somebody is looking down on us,
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   the easy way out is to just simply compromise.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   Okay, me too.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   My guess is earlier when he said
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   there are these hypocrites
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   who they don't even actually obey the law themselves,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   my guess is there are plenty of individuals who lied.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   Oh, yeah, okay, I'll get circumcised.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   I got it, I got it, right?
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   My guess is that temptation to lie
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   is incredibly heavy and it's there.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   But the point I want to make is
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.960]   this is kind of a sad situation
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   because what you have then
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   are essentially cowards bullying other cowards, right?
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   The Pharisees in the time of Jesus,
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   they were cowardice.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   They were afraid of the people.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:25.960]   They were afraid of the masses
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.960]   and that's why when Jesus would ask them the questions,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.960]   "Well, who do you say John the Baptist is?"
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   They would sit there and be like,
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.960]   "We know he straight up has baptized all these people.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   "Many people think he's the prophet.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   "Many people think da-da-da-da-da,
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   "but then he's testing to who you are,
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:43.960]   "so what do they do?"
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960]   "I don't know," right?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960]   So what you have essentially are cowards
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   bullying other people to do what they do
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   so that they don't get called out.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   And so in this kind of situation,
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   it's almost straight up like in high school
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   when a bunch of kids who are bullies,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.960]   they know they're going to fail an exam,
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960]   and so in so much as they can find a way
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.960]   that they don't get exposed for their own lack of knowledge,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   they're going to make everybody fail, right?
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.960]   It's a sad situation.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   Moving forward to the next motivation that he highlights,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.960]   he says they have this desire to boast in your flesh,
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   okay, to boast in your flesh.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   In this, we ask the question, strangely,
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   he says that they're going to boast in your flesh, right?
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   Not that they're going to boast in their own flesh,
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   but they're going to boast in yours,
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   so what are we supposed to take this as?
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   My guess is, kind of deducing from this fact is,
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   if you have an individual who was a Jew
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   and a leader amongst the Jews,
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960]   and then he was converting,
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   but then he also was now converting other Christians
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   who were coming into the church by saying,
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   ooh, if you really want to be spiritual,
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   if you really want to obey the law of God,
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   then be circumcised too,
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.960]   every person he gets to convert
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.960]   becomes a little notch on his belt saying,
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   look how many people I converted.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   It'd be like me saying, dude, I'd go out to the spectrum,
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.960]   and I convert like 15 people every Saturday,
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   and what's more, I disciple like 500 guys at church,
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:15.960]   and I train 10 people a year for leadership,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.960]   and that would be me boasting in your flesh.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   Now, I want to take a moment just to talk to us
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   about thinking about this passage.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   So right now, so far, in thinking about this passage,
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960]   verse 12 through 13,
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   I've kind of pushed it like, don't be like this.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   Don't be afraid of people's eyes,
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   and don't promote yourself.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   Don't be all haughty about your ministry accomplishments,
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   how successful you are at evangelism, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.960]   We know that, yes?
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.960]   Okay.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   But in context, this passage,
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   Apostle Paul is challenging us,
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   but why are you impressed with this?
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.960]   Why are you allowing yourself to be pushed by this?
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.960]   Like, I know you're supposed to be
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   a good follower of Christ,
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.960]   and yes, you're supposed to be submissive to each other,
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.960]   but you have the mind of Christ,
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.960]   and I taught you the gospel,
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   and the gospel says, "Sufficiency in Jesus."
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   Why are you following this word,
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   where not only are you not sufficient in Jesus,
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   but you're boasting in your accomplishment,
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   and your pride, and your flesh,
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   and all the earthly things that come, right?
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.960]   So what a point of conviction is,
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   you have this situation where essentially,
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   Apostle Paul, he sounds kind of mean,
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   because he's sitting there going, "Look at them.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   "Their hearts are wicked.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   "It's full of selfishness.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   "They're going to use you."
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   And it kind of reminds me of, like,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   a woman who is just head over heels,
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   completely sprung over a guy,
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   and the guy is just a jerk.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.960]   He's arrogant, he's boastful, he's a user.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   He just wants you because of the reputation,
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.960]   and then he's going to even try to have you.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   He'll boast about it,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.960]   and then when he's pleased, he's not going to care, right?
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   And then, Apostle Paul has the job of saying, like,
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   "Do you understand who he is?"
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   And the girl's sitting there like,
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   "But I think he really cares about me," right?
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   That's how the situation kind of feels,
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.960]   because he is having to convince them,
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   "Look, look at their heart and intention," right?
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   So then now, as a point of application for you,
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.960]   can you discern like Apostle Paul does?
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   Are you sober-minded?
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.960]   If you have any bit of that fleshliness in your heart
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.960]   where you love the attention, you crave attention,
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.960]   you're going to succumb to this.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   If you have elements in your heart where you like leadership,
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   you're, like, given to this generation's infatuation
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   with everything related to leadership,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   because we've been taught at a young age,
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.960]   you're going to compete, and you're going to grow,
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   you're going to succeed, and you're going to be a leader.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.960]   And that's in you, then you're going to succumb to this.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   But Apostle Paul says, "No."
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   As we move into the next section,
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]   Apostle Paul is going to declare that to him,
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   the reason why, in this circumstance,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   his tone is, "Look at them," right?
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.960]   It's very condemning towards the heart of the false teachers.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960]   It's because the gospel to him is everything.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   It's because Christ is everything.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   And anything that takes away from the necessity
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   and the sufficiency of Christ is an absolute enemy, right?
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   And so we have here, in contrast, he says,
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.960]   "May it never be that I would boast,
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.960]   "except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.960]   "through which the world has been crucified to me
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960]   "and I to the world.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.960]   "For neither is circumcision anything,
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.960]   "nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   So when we think about this, just what a powerful statement,
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   like what a convicting statement to say
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.960]   that there is going to be nothing to his credit,
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   nothing he glories in, and nothing he magnifies, right?
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   Nothing he boasts about, nothing he proclaims and tells,
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   but that of the cross of Christ.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.960]   And then he says that the world is crucified to him
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   and he to the world.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   Let's ask a question, okay?
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.960]   This is something that maybe for us,
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.960]   we may just feel like, okay, all he's saying
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   is me and my love relationship,
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   me and my enslavement previously to the world, done.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   My relationship is severed, okay?
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960]   But let's ask the question, is there any difference
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   between the world being crucified to me
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   versus me being crucified to the world, right?
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   And the only thing I just want to take a brief moment
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   to describe is I do realize that the relationship
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   was two ways.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Or there are a couple ways in which the relationship
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   between an individual and the world
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   could be so entangled, right?
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   One way is if I looked at the world with such affection
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   and said, "Oh, that's so nice.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   "That's so beautiful.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.960]   "I want that thing.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   "I want that house.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   "I want that car."
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   And the things that are products of this time generation
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   and the hands of men became so enticing to me,
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   my wants and my desires to have the world
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.960]   was what needed to die, right?
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.960]   But on the flip side, I realized part of the reason
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   why we struggle with the eyes of men
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   is because we long to be desired by the world.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   Not only do I want to have the world,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   I want to be wanted.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.960]   I want the world to have me, right?
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   And in that way, it was like a two-way street.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   Now, if you guys recall, not too long ago,
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   there was a sermon I gave about partiality and I said,
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   "Hey, in some sense, partiality,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   "it's a sin because you make distinction.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   "Certain people with money and certain people with prestige,
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   "you treat better."
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   And the word there in the book of James was,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   "The evil is in your heart
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.960]   "because you made that distinction with evil motive," right?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   And the thing I wanted to confess again was
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   there was a sense in which I thought I was safe
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   because I was like, "Dude, I'm mature now.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.960]   "I don't treat rich people better just 'cause they're rich," right?
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.960]   What's more, I'm a dedicated pastor.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960]   I've already said, "Dude, forsake the world.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   "Take it from me."
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   I am willing to just live off of whatever
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   and the thing about it is right now,
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   I'm more than content. I'm blessed.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   I live in a nice home. I drive a nice Toyota.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   I have a great family.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   I have just about everything I can want, right?
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   I have no complaints.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:54.960]   And then I said, "But is there any way where I could be compromised?"
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   And that's when I realized, yes,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.960]   because what I want for my children
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.960]   is I want the world to revere them.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.960]   I want the world to think so highly of them.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   "Oh, look at him. He's so tall.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:12.960]   "He's so handsome. Such a good kid," right?
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   It's in there.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.960]   I want him to have, essentially, some of the best things of the world,
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.960]   and I want the world to see him as the best in the world.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   And in that way, it goes both directions.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.960]   But we have this reminder from Scripture,
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960]   "Replace circumcision with any of that."
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   My kid's height, his education, how well he swims,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.960]   whatever it may be, it means nothing.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   The only thing valuable is becoming a new creation in Christ, amen?
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   Salvation in Christ means we have everything.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.960]   The great blessedness of the gospel is we have every single thing in Christ.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.960]   And so personally, as we start wrapping this up,
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.960]   man, we had so many huge themes running through the book of Galatians,
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   everything from freedom, right?
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   Like you're free, everything from sonship.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.960]   And I want to say, you know, right here,
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   why the Apostle Paul says with such conviction,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   "I will boast in nothing but Christ, and through the cross of the Lord,
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   I want to experience that kind of power and conviction to a new degree.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   I want to conclude by saying I think sometimes when I read it,
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   I feel like I understand what that means
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   because I've made decisions in the past, right?
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   I don't care how much of the world I have.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.960]   I've made decisions like that.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   I want to challenge you.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.960]   Periodically, from season to season in your Christian life,
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.960]   as you mature, the true Christian is going to experience greater depth of that.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   Why? Because his love for Christ is supposed to grow
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   to such a degree where indirectly the solution was always more love for Jesus,
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.960]   more satisfaction in Christ, more completeness in the Lord,
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   so that I can experience what it means to be free from the world, amen?
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your challenging word.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   We thank you, God, for this letter where we see the contrast.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.960]   We see the operation, the silly games and the system of the world
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   constantly wanting to level up and promote self,
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   constantly wanting to be able to say, "Look at me.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.960]   Look what I have done. Look at who I am."
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:48.960]   But Lord, help us to see the complete joy of our lives when Christ is all,
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960]   when Christ is everything,
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.960]   and help us to live by that conviction in such a powerful way.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:00.960]   Okay, I do want to take a moment to highlight some things for next week
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   because next week is our review and final paragraph in Galatians 16 through 18.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   I want to challenge you because even though it's just three short verses,
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   there are so many questions you can ask, especially a big one.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   So you can sit there and say, "Those who will walk by this road,"
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   who are those? What rule are we talking about?
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.960]   "Peace and mercy upon them," who is them?
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   "And upon the Israel of God."
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   Through the book of Galatians, I'm sure you guys probably,
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   certain key moments, especially chapter three,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   asked the question of what is the relationship between the New Testament church
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   and the nation of Israel?
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   You may have or you may not,
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   but this is one of those passages that come up a lot in the debate,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   and so I'm going to actually kind of present on it,
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   giving you guys some considerations and conclusions to think about, okay?
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.960]   So make sure that you guys are actually studying this passage
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   and not thinking of it as he's just saying, like, "Goodbye,"
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   and then that's the end, right?
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   There's a lot in here.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   So you could ask everything from, "Dude, how does the brand marks of Jesus
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   "contribute to, like, his confidence?
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   "Like, what is he saying?" et cetera.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   And, "What is his attitude of, like, 'Let nobody trouble me'?
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   "Is he actually saying, 'Don't talk to me about this anymore'?" et cetera.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.960]   There's a lot, okay?
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Plus, can you please make sure
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   that you do an actual review of chapter four through six?
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   So read through the letter so you get the flow.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   It's always good to know the flow, okay?
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   Out of context is a bad situation.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:49.960]   From chapter four through six, what were the major movements?
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:52.960]   And then if you can think of, since we've hit three chapters,
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.960]   three key verses to memorize, that would be awesome.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.960]   And then what are the most important applications from chapter four to six, okay?
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   The only announcement that I will highlight for you guys
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:08.960]   is that our outreach team is preparing a summer seekers group.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.960]   As you know, we have no Bible study through the months of June, July,
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.960]   most of August.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   So there's going to be a seeker group that will meet four times.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   If you have any unbelieving friends or family,
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   we will put this up online, the QR code,
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.960]   so that you can just shoot it over to them, right?
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   But we will cover a book called "What is the Gospel?"
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   So each participant will get a free book.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:40.960]   And it just goes over the foundational elements of what is salvation
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   and how does one come to true faith in Christ, okay?
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.960]   If you have any questions, please contact me or Joseph Su.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.960]   All right.
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   Pastor Peter, we'll come up and do some extra now.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.960]   All right, as you guys know, this coming Saturday,
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.960]   we have a fundraiser softball tournament that we host.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   And so if you guys can come and cheer, if you're not participating already,
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.960]   it's this Saturday.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.960]   Our teams are going to get there around 7 a.m.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   And hopefully the championship, which is at 4 p.m., our teams are in it.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.960]   So it's going to be an all-day affair.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:29.960]   And then the 19th, that Sunday, between third service to 3.30,
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   all the family ministry people are invited out to a picnic at Bill Barber Park.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   If you are a couple that's been married after 2022, you're in the FAM 245,
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.960]   there's a barbecue fellowship next Saturday.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.960]   And then women's softball, it's not a tournament,
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.960]   but it is an opportunity for the ladies to play softball together.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   We actually have a very competitive ladies team,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:04.960]   but all the other churches, they don't have ladies.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.960]   And so we couldn't make a ladies tournament.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   So this is kind of in substitute for that.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.960]   Next week is our final Bible study.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   But the week after that, we don't have Bible study,
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:21.960]   but we have an all-church praise and prayer at 7.30.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.960]   So the most important thing, just to kind of remember from this,
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.960]   is Bible study resumes August 28th.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.960]   Details are still pending.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   But if you can, go ahead and sign up for the fall Bible study now
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:41.960]   so that we can figure out how many small group tables
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.960]   and home groups and stuff like that that we need.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.960]   So please do sign up sooner than later.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   And we repeat this every semester,
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   but there are people who sign up like the week before.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   So please do this sooner than later.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   And then here are some discussion questions that Pastor Mark prepared for you,
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960]   and then I'll leave you with that.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.960]   Thank you.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.960]   [end]
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.960]   [end]
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:08.960]   [end]
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   [end]
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.960]   [end]
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   [end]
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   [end]
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.960]   [end]
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:17.960]   [end]
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:27.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
