[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Good morning.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.240]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.240]   And I'm going to be reading from verse 14 to 17.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920]   And I'm going to give you a heads up.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.600]   Something funny happened right before I came up.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.940]   I was praying and my mom came up to me and she tapped me on my shoulder and then she
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.640]   opened up a packet and she said, "Eat it."
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.680]   So as a good son, I just ate it.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.160]   And then she opened up another one and then, so I just ate it.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.640]   And I said, "What is this?"
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.280]   And she said, "It's good for you.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   Don't worry about it.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.360]   Just eat it."
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360]   So I ate it.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   And I said, "So what is this?"
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.800]   And she said, "It's supposed to help you to sleep."
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.760]   And I didn't think about it until middle of the worship.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.200]   It's like, I'm getting drowsy.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.680]   So I don't think it's supposed to affect me immediately.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.600]   It's just probably psychological.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   But anyway, that's the love of mom and my obedience.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.200]   If I slur my words as to reason, and I had two of it before I came up.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   Okay.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   Anyway.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.520]   So if I make, if it's complete nonsense, it's not the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520]   Whatever it is, I eat.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   Okay.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.600]   So let's go to 12 verses 14 through 17.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   Pursue peace with all men and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720]   See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no root of bitterness springing
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.800]   That there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.520]   a single meal.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.100]   For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessings, he was rejected,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.880]   for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   Let's pray.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Lord God, for your grace that sustains us, renews
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   us, strengthens us, Lord God.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.160]   I pray that you would give us soberness of mind, heart, ears to listen, and desire and
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.120]   will, Father, God, to apply all that you teach.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Amen.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   Let me start by asking you this question.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.560]   If you were to turn the clock back 10, possibly 20 years, I say 10 because some of you guys
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.280]   may not have been alive 20 years ago, but some of you guys are older, maybe 20 years,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   okay, or to 10 years.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.860]   If you were able to turn the clock back, what would you tell yourself 10, 20 years younger?
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.820]   Maybe financially you'd tell yourself, "Buy some Bitcoin."
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800]   You know, you have no idea, right?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   Buy several thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin and you'll become a multimillionaire, right?
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.160]   Maybe financially that's something you might be telling yourself.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.960]   Physically, I would tell myself to take care of my knees.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   You know, when you're young, you don't think much about it because you get injured, you
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   get right back up, but, you know, like once you mess up your knees, it's over, right?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   So I'm envious of people who can run.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.480]   Not that I want to run, but the possibility that you can run, right?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.620]   If you ask people who are older, and I thought this was interesting because somebody asked
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.200]   me this question, like, "What period of your life would you want to try to like get back
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.500]   or experience again?"
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.440]   And without thinking, it's probably in my 30s and the reason why is because that's when
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   the children were young.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.780]   And so I think most parents, when you think about this, like, yeah, that's the period.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.860]   As hard as that period was, right, financially, church, in every way it was a very difficult
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.300]   period, but it's also the period that I have the fondest memory of because the children
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.300]   were young, you know?
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.700]   And I know that some of the parents who are, you know, huffing and puffing with small children
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.840]   right now, they think, it's like, "Oh, I just can't wait until they are older and you can
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   get out of the house."
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.140]   But as soon as they get out of the house, you're like, "Oh, it was great when they were young.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.020]   They were attached to us," right?
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.500]   But our tendency is when time passes, we always look back and our memory and what we value
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.780]   at that period of time is very different than, you know, when we're experiencing it.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.020]   So it's good time to time for us to look back and say, "Well, those are things that..."
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.660]   And it causes us to see the future differently.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.020]   So I have another question.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.420]   If you were 30, 40, 50 years, depending on how old you are, on your deathbed, and you
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.020]   were to talk to yourself now, who you are now, however old you are, what would you tell
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.020]   yourself now?
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.580]   Just give it a minute, right?
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.820]   On your deathbed, what is happening now that if you were able to come back and talk to
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.660]   you now on your deathbed, what would you tell yourself?
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.120]   Maybe physically, financially, you'll have some other thoughts.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.300]   We don't know what's coming on in the future.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.660]   But I know one thing for sure, if you are a believer, genuine believer, on your deathbed,
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.300]   that you're not gonna tell yourself, "Hey, maybe you should have gone to LA and tasted
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.140]   that new boba that came from Taiwan."
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.260]   I don't think that you're not gonna be regretting that.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.220]   You'll say, "Oh, man, that was a bucket list.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.740]   I wanted to go travel there, and I forgot.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.020]   I didn't get to see that."
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.900]   You know, you may have some of those regrets, but on your deathbed, you're gonna cut through
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.700]   all of that clutter, and you're gonna get to what's gonna matter the most, which is
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.980]   eternity.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.980]   And most likely, you will say this, "See to it that no one comes short of the grace of
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.220]   God."
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.100]   In one form or another, you'll probably tell yourself this, "Make sure as we are facing
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.180]   eternity that no one comes short of the grace of God."
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.220]   What we're gonna regret, if we regret anything, is that we didn't live to the fullest in this
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.380]   short period of time that we have to love Christ and to love our neighbors as ourselves.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.060]   We're not gonna regret that we didn't put enough money in retirement, not on our deathbed.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.580]   We're not gonna regret that we didn't get to travel as much as we did, or that we didn't
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.140]   invest in Bitcoin early enough.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.200]   Those are all things that we have concerns during this life.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.040]   But as we face eternity, none of those things are gonna matter.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.420]   And so, verse 15 is an accumulation of everything that he's been really trying to say to the
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.220]   readers of Hebrews, that you're drifting because you've forgotten what it is that you have
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.020]   in Christ, to have an eternal perspective that Christ is worth whatever it is that you're
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.020]   suffering.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.300]   Christ is worth whatever it is that you're sacrificing, and to make sure that no one
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.100]   comes short of the grace of God.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.060]   What does it mean to come short of the grace of God?
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.740]   I mean, grace means a free gift.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.040]   So how do you come short of this?
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.840]   So I wanna take a few minutes this morning to talk about, like, who is he referring to?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.900]   I think there's three different categories of people that needs to take heed of what
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.260]   he is saying.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.140]   One, unbelievers.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.520]   If there's anyone in this room or on the internet who is kind of on the fence, and you're here
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.980]   because you're just curious, or maybe your friend has brought you here, and you're coming
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.740]   because you think something is there, there's gotta be more to life than this, but you haven't
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.640]   come fully to Christ.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.020]   Maybe you're telling yourself you're busy.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.720]   Maybe sometime down the line, maybe when the kids are older, maybe when my business is
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.620]   more established, maybe when I find my job or finish my school, then I'll give my full
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.460]   attention to this, but right now I'm just too busy.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.460]   Well, Mark chapter 8, 36, Jesus addresses this thinking, "For what does it profit a
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.120]   man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.760]   If eternity is real, if God is real, if what the Bible says is real, there is nothing more
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.860]   important for every human being to not only make a decision of what this is, but do our
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.420]   best to follow Christ with all our might.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.400]   There is no in between.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.420]   If Christ is real, then everything that we do is a preparation for eternity.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:38.660]   It doesn't matter, even if you were successful in your wildest dream, that you bought $100,000
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.440]   worth of Bitcoin 15 years ago, and now you're a multi, multimillionaire, as you face eternity,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.760]   it means absolutely nothing.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.060]   Maybe if you're young, your fantasy is to become a professional baseball player or an
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.020]   NBA professional athlete.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.380]   Even if your most wildest dreams came true, as we face eternity, it will mean absolutely
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.500]   nothing if this is true.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.860]   If it is not true, there is no bigger lie that has been told in human history.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.100]   There's nothing in between.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.060]   Jesus didn't just say he's a good moral teacher, gave us a good example of how we ought to
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.680]   live to make mankind a better place during this lifetime.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.880]   He claimed to be God.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.520]   He said he has power to forgive sins.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.160]   He resurrected from the dead, and his followers gave their life telling this lie, if it's
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.740]   a lie.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:42.140]   Not tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have forfeited the benefit
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.760]   of this world in order to proclaim this truth.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:55.380]   So there is no lie that has done more damage to mankind than this lie if this is not true.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.600]   There is no in between.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.880]   If he is God, that means everything in this world is temporary, and all of it should be
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.580]   forfeited so that we can have eternity.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:14.860]   Or you deny him, these bunch of crazy people, that this is probably one of the worst things
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.940]   that has happened to humanity.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.820]   Where do you stand with this?
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.300]   The Bible says in Hebrews 9, 27, "Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.140]   after this comes judgment."
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:36.260]   Death is imminent, and it is absolute.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.580]   I've never had a conversation with a non-Christian where we said, "Inasmuch as it is appointed
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.460]   for all men to die once," and somebody said, "No, not all men, some men, most men."
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   But not all men.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.600]   I've never had that discussion because it's not debated.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.220]   We all know whether you are a multimillionaire or whether you are poor and homeless, we all
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.700]   die the same way.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   And we know it's coming.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.460]   We know that our life is temporary.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.780]   And the question is, what's after that?
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.020]   But most people live as if this is it.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.440]   We occasionally think about eternity.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.720]   But if eternity is real, shouldn't that be the greatest question that we wrestle with?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.580]   Even more than Bitcoin, how much money we have in retirement, even more than any other
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.460]   question that we wrestle with, shouldn't that be the greatest question?
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.620]   The Bible says, "Inasmuch as it is appointed for all men to die once, after this will come
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.200]   judgment."
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:40.620]   To come into the judgment seat of Christ simply because we didn't have time, simply because
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.780]   I was just too busy.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.180]   What a tragedy to come into judgment when the Word of God says that we will have to
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:55.420]   give account for every careless word, every sinful thought, to stand before a holy judge,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.300]   everything that you and I think that we got away with because the government didn't catch
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.360]   us, the police didn't catch us.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.140]   Maybe my wife didn't catch us.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.100]   But a holy God who sees all things, knows all things, who is all powerful, he said,
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.060]   "We're going to stand before this holy judge," and he said, "We're going to have to give
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.820]   account for every sin, every lustful thought."
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:22.980]   To go into eternity to meet this holy God simply because we were too busy.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.440]   There's no greater question that a non-Christian should be asking and to be affirmed.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:37.880]   This is true, and to give my life to make him my king, or this is the biggest lie that's
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.260]   been ever told, but to be in the middle is not safe.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.680]   See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.860]   The second group of people that this is a warning and encouragement to is professing
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.740]   believers but maybe in danger of drifting into damnation themselves.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.340]   You notice I said professing believers.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.740]   These are people that probably are not Christians.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:07.640]   We live in a post-Christian culture where people are born into Christianity, or you
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.040]   are shamed into Christianity.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:18.340]   If you are a Christian, they're in one of these campus ministries, it's hard not to
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.080]   be a Christian.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.420]   They persecute you.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.060]   You get persecuted for not coming to Bible study.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.780]   You get persecuted for not joining small group.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.600]   You get persecuted for not serving.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.300]   You get persecuted for not going to church.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.420]   There's heavy persecution.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.280]   You have to pick up your cross, almost not to be a Christian.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.960]   So in a post-Christian culture with so much pressure, during that period, now that begins
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.200]   to die down after you graduate, but during college where there's so much pressure, especially
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.280]   if you grew up in the church from the home, from your friends, from your environment,
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.480]   and so you end up just kind of going and then not really giving it serious thought.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.740]   And so you learn to play the game.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.340]   You know what to say.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.580]   You know what you're supposed to do.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.520]   You know the doctrines to profess, but it was always superficially from a distance in
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:16.660]   order to be accepted by whatever church or whatever group that you belong to.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.260]   You know what the sociologists call that contagion norm theory.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:26.820]   Contagion norm theory is anything that you do repetitively, you become blind to.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.600]   That's why when we're young, we're blind to the love of parents because they just do it
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.680]   all the time.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.880]   And then when your friends do it, it's like, "Oh my gosh, he's the best friend in the world,"
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.200]   but your parents do that every single day.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.600]   And then you get a little bit older, then the things that you value the most, sometimes
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.340]   we are blind to until they're gone.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.520]   And then you realize, "Wow, that had the biggest impact in my life."
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.360]   And again, that's what they call the contagion norm theory.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.320]   If you are an individual who grew up in the church and just kind of affiliated yourself
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.020]   with Christianity, so you came and you did all of that, but you've become blind to what
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.540]   it means to be a true follower of Christ.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:18.520]   You just enculturated yourself to Christianity, but you're not really a follower of Christ.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.840]   It's a warning to those people who just kind of accepted superficially.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.380]   And then when the test came and when it became difficult, when the persecution to become
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.680]   Christian starts to die out, and then the real persecution to bring you away from Christ,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   all of a sudden, now the tide is going the other way.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.040]   Now you're riding the tide the other way.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.560]   It's a warning to them, again, not to drift, not to neglect.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.100]   In Matthew 7, 21 to 23, it says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.840]   kingdom of heaven.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.720]   But he who does the will of my Father, who is in heaven, will enter."
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.200]   Not everybody who professes and says the right things are genuine Christians.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.120]   Verse 22, "Many will say to me on that day," many, not a few, "Many will say to me on that
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.720]   day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?'"
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.920]   Even prophesying is not evidence of genuine faith.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.320]   That's what he says.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.920]   "And in your name cast out demons."
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.960]   They cast out demons.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.720]   It wasn't evidence of genuine faith.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.880]   "And in your name perform miracles."
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:30.160]   They are prophesying, casting out demons, performing miracles, calling him Lord, Lord,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.520]   in verse 23, "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.760]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'"
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.040]   I remember the first time I came across this text as a young Christian, and it shook me
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.360]   to my boots, to the core.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.560]   How do I know this is not me?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.840]   How do I know this is not me?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.400]   How do I know that my faith is just cultural?
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.840]   I came from a Christian home, surrounded by Christians.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.400]   I was part of a campus ministry, went to a Christian school.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   How do I know this is not me?
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.600]   And I wanted to make sure that this was not me.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.640]   And that was part of the motivation behind why I wanted to pursue.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.720]   I was asking questions.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.280]   How do I know the Trinity is real?
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.360]   How can I believe that this Bible is really God's inerrant word, simply because somebody
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   told me so?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.940]   Because my dad was a pastor?
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.040]   How do I know this?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.320]   How do I know I'm not a Christian simply because I'm surrounded by other Christians?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   Would I believe this?
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.200]   Would I follow Christ, even if I was the only one left?
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.000]   If I was living in Iran, would I be a Christian?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.200]   If I was living in the villages in India, where they're hostile toward Christianity,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.520]   would I be a Christian there?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:48.240]   And so I wrestled, and that's part of the reason why I pursued and I asked questions.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.360]   When he says, "See to it no one comes short of the grace of God," he's referring also
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:18:00.440]   to people who are professing Christians, but the faith that they have is just being around
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.480]   other Christians.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.280]   They grew up, and that's the right thing to say.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.400]   Sometimes just being around and hearing the gospel and hearing the word of God preached,
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.360]   and again, being so much around that we become blind.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.560]   You know, recently I've been trying to exercise, so we bought a bike, and I've been trying
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   to bike back and forth, you know?
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.400]   And I've lived in the same street, right, for the last maybe about 12, 13 years on a
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.560]   cul-de-sac, and right behind us we have this nice trail that people walk on and bike along.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.880]   For the first 10 years, I didn't think anything about it, because nobody's on that trail,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   you know?
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.640]   And then the pandemic hit, and all of a sudden there's so much noise back there, it's annoying,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.280]   because there's a little hill, and kids go skateboarding there.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.480]   So I hear them, you know, with music on, and they're playing, and I want to be one of those
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.360]   old guys saying, "Keep it down out there!"
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.000]   So they started using that, and then now, because I started to bike and we started to
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.560]   walk, I said, "Man, that'd be awesome!"
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.840]   But it was there all along, all along, it was right behind us, but because we weren't
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.960]   using it, I didn't appreciate it.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.520]   Now I'm thinking, like, we have a wall, you know, between that trail and our house, so
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.560]   like I'm thinking of ways to knock the wall down without HOA knowing about it, right?
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.440]   All along, we've been there for over 10, 12 years, you know?
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.720]   And all I was, it's like, there's a train track right there, just annoyed with the train
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.000]   track, but not realizing there's this great trail right behind the house.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.240]   There are so many people who are in the church, around the gospel, preaching, small groups,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:55.120]   mission work, and being around all of this all your life, and never fully coming to Christ.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.680]   Those people will miss and come short of the grace of God if they do not stop and ask themselves,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:11.880]   "Am I a cultural Christian, or do I really believe this Jesus?"
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.360]   The author says in Hebrews 6, 4-8, this is a passage that we looked at many months ago,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:23.400]   and he's referring to these very people, these cultural Christians.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.560]   He says, "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.720]   word of God, and the powers of the age to come."
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.560]   Now if you just look at verse 4 and 5, he's saying, "I mean, clearly this must be a Christian."
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.280]   I mean, he was enlightened.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.200]   He's not talking about a Christian, he's talking about somebody who has understood.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.320]   He's been enlightened.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.120]   He didn't know before, but now he knows.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.120]   Tasted the heavenly gift.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.160]   I mean, he's been around the church, the benefit of being in a covenant community, partakers
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.020]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.160]   They had first row seats of the work of the Holy Spirit with other people, hearing testimonies,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.640]   baptism, going out to summer mission trips, and he was around all of that.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.960]   And then yet, in verse 6, "And then they have fallen away.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.880]   It is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucified to themselves the
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.040]   Son of God and put him to open shame."
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.200]   Now, some people have interpreted this as saying, like, it seems like they're Christian,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.120]   and if they fall, God won't allow them to repent again.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.840]   Now, you have to make sure that Scripture has to interpret Scripture.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.280]   The Bible clearly says that our salvation is a gift that God has given to us freely.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   Right?
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.400]   Everybody knows Ephesians 2, 8, and 9.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.560]   So if it's a free gift, we didn't earn it, so we can't lose it.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.960]   But then what does it mean here?
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.880]   He's talking about an individual who's in the church, who's been fed, and had every
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   opportunity to come to Christ.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.440]   That you were so close, you had all the benefits that any human being could possibly have to
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.600]   come to Christ, and you choose to drift away to the world.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.240]   So when he says "fallen away," he's not talking about somebody who is Christian and
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.600]   falls away from faith.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.680]   He's talking about somebody who's so near and chooses to go the other path.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.560]   And when he says "there is no repentance," he's talking about if you do not receive the
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.200]   grace of God, there is no other path.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.160]   There isn't two, three, four different ways to get to God.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.900]   There's only one.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.000]   And so if you drift away from that, if you drift away from the grace of God, there is
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.560]   no other way that an individual can repent.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.600]   And so that's what he means in verse 7, "For the ground that drinks the rain, which often
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.800]   falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it has also been tilled,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.200]   receives a blessing from God."
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.440]   In other words, the other fruits that actually come to Christ, they receive the feeding,
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.520]   the teaching, the church, and then they bear fruit.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.320]   But then in verse 8, "But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.920]   being cursed and ends up being burned."
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.120]   He's talking about an individual who's in the church, knows the vocabulary, knows the
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:24.600]   culture, meets the minimum standard, and yet with all their heart pursuing the world.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.960]   He's giving warning to them that they will miss the grace of God, being so close and
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.160]   yet so far.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   It is a warning.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.440]   In fact, you know, some people say, "You know, Pastor Peter, why do you speak so much about
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.640]   this?"
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.700]   Because I think where you and I are, this is the greatest problem.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:50.720]   My concern, I am more concerned about people who hear the gospel, who are in the church,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.800]   and then they say, "I'm good."
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.400]   Every once in a while I'll meet somebody who gets hostile after you preach the gospel.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.000]   How can you be so arrogant to think that Jesus is the only way?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.320]   It's ridiculous that you would think that the Son of God had come and He forgave us
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.760]   of our sins, He was resurrected, and that if we don't believe Him that we're going
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.280]   to have eternal damnation.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.080]   How dare you say that to me?
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   To me that makes sense because that's an unbeliever.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.960]   That's a reasonable response from an unbeliever because what I said was very offensive.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.560]   In fact, that's what the Bible says.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:33.040]   In fact, if you hear Jesus preaching, either they loved Him or hated Him.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.400]   There's very few people who are just like, "Yeah, yeah, you know, I think He kind of
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   might be the Messiah."
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   Who knows?
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.280]   And then they just walk away.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.080]   My biggest concern are people who are in the church who may have deceived themselves to
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.960]   be believers.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:57.800]   I've heard people say in the past years that the greatest mistake that a preacher can make
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.360]   is to cause a genuine child of God to question God's love for them.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.920]   So therefore, our preaching has to be affirming.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.040]   That we need to constantly remind people God loves you.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.760]   That even in your sins, God loves you.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.920]   So it is the greatest tragedy that someone would come to church and leave questioning
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.680]   the love of God.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.800]   Now there is some truth to that, but I don't think that that's the greatest tragedy.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   The greatest tragedy is to have people who are in the church headed toward eternal damnation
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:37.320]   and constantly giving them false assurance that they're okay.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.160]   An individual who is shaken of maybe a genuine believer in Christ, maybe wrestling with the
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.440]   love of Christ, will have an uncomfortable path to eternity.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.120]   So when they die, they're going to look back and say, "You know what?
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.560]   That was uncomfortable."
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.840]   But they're in eternity with Christ.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:03.080]   And an individual who has falsely believed that he is a believer in Christ may have had
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   a nice, easy path to eternal damnation.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.920]   Which is the greatest tragedy?
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:18.240]   I think you will all agree with me that the greatest tragedy, especially in our generation
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:26.320]   where you and I live, is that many who profess to be Christians will meet Christ in his judgment
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   seat.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.720]   "I never knew you."
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.680]   They miss the grace of God.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.280]   Around it, talked about it, memorized scripture, recited it to one another, but never really
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.440]   knew the Lord.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:51.080]   That's why I think one of the greatest mistakes, if you want to call it a mistake, that we've
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.000]   seen in our generation is the seeker-friendly movement.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.720]   It sounds great, seeker-friendly.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.280]   We're trying to be friendly to the seekers.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.620]   In and of itself, it doesn't sound that bad.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.240]   But the problem is we're trying to make the seekers comfortable, non-Christians comfortable
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.380]   with our music, with our culture, with the way we talk, the way we bring them to church.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.760]   We want them to feel comfortable.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.680]   We don't want them to have a bumpy ride once they come in.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.200]   If someone is genuinely seeking God, you know what they need more than anything else?
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.240]   To hear the voice of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.680]   Because the Bible says, "My sheep will hear my voice and follow me."
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.720]   They're not going to follow Christ because you're nice.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.440]   They're not going to follow Christ because the community here is good.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.520]   They're not going to follow Christ because they like the music.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.040]   They're not going to follow Christ because the pastor is funny.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.600]   They're going to follow Christ because they hear the truth.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.960]   And they get convicted with the truth.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.760]   And that truth causes them to be set free.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.920]   I'm not gifted enough.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.400]   I'm not talented enough.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.880]   We don't have enough money.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.160]   There's no amount of money, no amount of talent, no amount of experience can get somebody
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.360]   who is condemned for eternity to change their mind and say, "I'm going to follow Christ
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.200]   because I like their music.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.000]   Because this pastor is interesting to listen to."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.800]   The only power to save a non-Christian is the voice of Christ.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:30.480]   And so the greatest challenge, calling for every church is to make that clear, even if
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.600]   it makes them feel uncomfortable.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:42.480]   To build a church filled with nominal Christians who feel safe on the way to eternal damnation
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.280]   is the greatest mistake, greatest sin.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.800]   There's no different than being on the sinking ship, the Titanic, and your biggest concern
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.160]   is not that they're going to die, but your biggest concern is to not to disturb their
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.920]   peace.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.680]   If their peace is not disturbed, how will they know that they're in danger?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.800]   You know, I hear people every once in a while say, "Who am I to judge?
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   Who am I to judge?"
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.760]   If they say, if you think, "I want to be gracious.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.440]   I want to be loving."
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.160]   Is it loving to tell somebody that you believe is headed to hell that, "I don't want you
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.360]   to be mad at me"?
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.060]   Is that for them or is that for you?
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.840]   If you really believe that damnation is coming, to have them feel comfortable near you, is
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.120]   that really for them or is that for you?
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.760]   Now it doesn't mean that we need to be jerks.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.280]   It doesn't mean that we need to be offensive for no reason.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   But the gospel itself is offensive.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.520]   If we actually love them, we have to make sure that our greatest goal is that they come
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.340]   to Christ.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.480]   And that's what he means.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   That make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.940]   But there's also the third group.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:04.840]   The third group are genuine believers who have become fatigued and tired.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.680]   And you may be asking yourself, "Is this really worth it?"
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.800]   And at time to time, even genuine Christians will ask that question.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.160]   And then that's what he was referring to, someone who is drooping hands and weak knees
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.760]   to make straight path for the Lord, to persevere.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.260]   First Corinthians 15.58, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable."
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.220]   Immovable means don't change.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.220]   Don't change.
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.620]   Always abounding in the work of the Lord.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.760]   Always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   Lord.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:43.160]   Let's look at this passage.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.880]   When we are fatigued and we're tired, our first inclination is, "I want to take a break.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.600]   I want to change the circumstance, change the group, change this.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.000]   I'm going to stop doing that.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.600]   Stop doing this."
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.320]   I've rarely found somebody who said, "I need to take a break."
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.200]   And then after the break, they came back more rejuvenated.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   "I'm going to take a break.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   I'm not going to serve.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   I'm not going to do this.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.600]   I'm not going to participate in the church.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.300]   I'm just going to come to church and do nothing."
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.320]   And at the year end of that, they come back and say, "I'm ready.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.900]   I'm rejuvenated."
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.920]   Most of the times at the end of the year, they're more tired.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.820]   They're more fatigued.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.820]   They're more bitter.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.360]   They're more angry.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.200]   So they weren't really resting in Christ.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.280]   They were just tired and they just wanted to just be on their own.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.080]   I'm tired of following Christ.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.120]   For the time being, I'm going to take a break."
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   You notice here the encouragement is to continue, to be steadfast, to be immovable, always abounding
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.680]   in the work of the Lord.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:56.320]   When I'm tired, usually I'm tired not because I had a long day.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.740]   Those days are true.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.960]   Most of us feel tired because we haven't moved enough.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.480]   You have to go to the gym and exercise.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.700]   And so we've been relaxed for too long.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.760]   And I think most people who feel tired may be tired for that reason.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.360]   And so he's encouraging them.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.800]   Is it worth it?
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.240]   And the answer is resounding emphatically, "Yes."
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.200]   And that's where the fatigue comes from.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.160]   The fatigue comes from, for most of us, is not because we've been working so hard, but
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.580]   it's because we've forgotten that Christ is worth it.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.580]   And so he reminds us.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.960]   That's why he spends 10 chapters.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.840]   Christ is better than anything that you're tempted by.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.400]   Christ is better than Judaism.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.680]   Christ is better than the temple.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.240]   Christ is better than anything that this world can offer you.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.600]   And when we can say emphatically, "Yes, he is better than all of that," all of a sudden
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.800]   we gain strength, energy to persevere and to continue.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.560]   It's worth the sacrifice.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.900]   It's worth the fatigue.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.520]   It's worth the suffering.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:11.480]   Christ is worth whatever we wrestle with, because in the end, the reward is in Christ.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.160]   Have we forgotten what it is that we profess?
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.800]   What is it exactly that we have in Christ?
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   Think about it.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.560]   Think about what we have in Christ.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   Think about how often we are so frustrated because we didn't get the job we wanted or
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.520]   somebody said something to us that we didn't like.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.680]   It's how fixated we are on that, and then we easily forget God sent his only begotten
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:48.640]   Son to take our place so that we would have eternity, and then to call him our Abba Father.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.160]   Think about how mind-blowing that is.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.720]   When that becomes contagion norm, that's when fatigue comes in.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.880]   That's when we want to quit.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.800]   I told you our family immigrated to the United States in 1975.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.840]   I was seven going on eight at that time.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.360]   Korea was a third world country at that time.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.040]   It was very poor.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.400]   I remember the first time Halloween came.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.440]   In Korea, it wasn't just us.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.360]   The whole country was poor.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.840]   In fact, I think our family was probably better off than most people because my grandfather
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.440]   was a pretty wealthy man.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.200]   But I don't remember that many times just eating candy.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:41.800]   The way that my mom would motivate me to take medicine was she would put sugar in water.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   That was our candy.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.920]   She would say, "Oh, if you eat this medicine, I'll give you some sugar water."
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   So this yes, right?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.480]   Most of you guys, that sounds ridiculous, but that's what we ate.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.400]   When we came to the United States, our cousin who was born and raised in the United States
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   said, "Hey, what are you going to do for Halloween?"
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   I said, "What's Halloween?"
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:06.240]   He said, "This is a day where you go and knock on strangers' doors and they give you candy."
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.880]   What?
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.320]   Imagine hearing that.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.980]   Some of you guys probably know exactly what I'm talking about, but imagine hearing that
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.720]   for the first time from the first seven, eight years of my life.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   I'm like, "What?"
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.840]   That's just like me telling you, go to the neighbor, just any door down the street, they're
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.960]   going to give you some money.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.640]   How many of you actually would believe that?
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.840]   I said, "No, I'm serious.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:38.040]   Once a year, just knock on strangers' door and they're going to have a pile of money
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.760]   ready for you and just going to give it to you."
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.000]   That's what it sounded like to me.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.800]   I didn't believe her, but we went.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:53.040]   Me and Phillip went because my older brother, I don't think he believed it.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.200]   So we went and I said, "Oh, before you go, there is a thing you had to do.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   You have to wear a costume."
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   I said, "What's a costume?"
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.720]   "Well, you have to put on something."
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   I said, "We didn't have anything, so we weren't prepared."
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:12.760]   And it was already Halloween, so we drew a face on a paper bag and put two holes in it.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.080]   And we actually only had one bag.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.000]   So Phillip and I took turns.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.560]   So we would be walking to the door and I would put the hat on and then, you know, we didn't
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.320]   speak English, so we just knocked on the door and just looked at them.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   And they would put candy in the bag and then said, "They gave us candy."
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.280]   Because we only had one bag, so now it's Phillip's turn.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.200]   So I would take it off and he would wear it.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.120]   He would go back and knock on the door and say, "Hey, weren't you the same kid?"
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.520]   I said, "No, it's the other guy with the paper bag."
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.080]   So we came home that night, probably about hour and a half, two hours of knocking on
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:51.480]   the door, and I remember the bag of candy that we poured onto the dining room table.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:57.120]   And I remember thinking, "We've made it."
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.680]   This is why everybody wants to come to the United States.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:08.160]   To this day, if you ask me what's my favorite childhood memory, it was that day.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   Free candy.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.760]   And this happens every year.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   Crazy.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.080]   I mean, it may sound ridiculous to you now.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.120]   You know, now you offer a lollipop to kids, it's like, "Nah."
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.240]   Like what?
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   It's free.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.720]   I mean, you know why I'm telling this story.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.160]   Even this simple offering of candy, I couldn't believe it.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.160]   For free?
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   Candy.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.240]   That rotted all my teeth.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.160]   Think about what it is that you and I have in Christ.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.720]   We sing these songs, we memorize scripture, we go out evangelizing, we sing all this stuff,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.480]   and it's become mundane.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.720]   That's the reason why we're fatigued.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   That's why we're tired.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   That's why we're discouraged.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   That's why we're so fixated.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.040]   That's why we're tempted.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.960]   Because we have forgotten what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.000]   The scripture says He has given us everything that we need for a life of godliness in the
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.520]   knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.600]   If He gave all things, if He was willing to give His only begotten Son, how will He not,
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.720]   along with Him, give Him all things?
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.160]   Even your suffering.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.880]   You think that He doesn't have any power to prevent that suffering in your life?
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.920]   If He didn't think that that was what's necessary for you?
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.320]   It is worth it.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.840]   It is more than worth it.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.520]   And so the encouragement to not to miss the grace of God to the believers is to persevere,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.720]   continue, be immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.400]   He says, "So that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled."
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.920]   The root of bitterness, the way that you and I typically understand it is like not being
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.240]   able to let go or forgive of somebody, and then you have bitterness and it grows up to
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.640]   animosity and hatred and slander.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.360]   That's true.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.340]   It's not a false way to understand it, but again, we need to understand biblical terms.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.480]   In the biblical language, what do they mean by that?
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.840]   Well that term, bitter roots, comes from Deuteronomy 29, 18-19.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:24.900]   So if you look at that, as Israel is getting ready to get into the promised land, God warns
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:30.240]   the nation of Israel, and this is what He says, that there will not be among you a man
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.920]   or a woman or family or tribe whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:41.040]   So again, this bitter root ultimately has to do with relationship with God more than
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.960]   relationship with each other.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.720]   To go and to serve gods of those nations, not to backslide, that there will not be among
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.040]   you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.500]   So what is He referring to?
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.640]   In our relationship with God, everything that I've taught you, instead of continuing to
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:05.020]   worship me, that you allow these bitter roots, meaning that this thing that's going to grow
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.600]   up to become useless fruit, that you do not allow this to happen.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:15.360]   And then verse 19, He says, "It shall be when he hears the words of this curse, that if
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:22.760]   you turn away from him, that he will boast, saying, 'I have peace, though I walk in the
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.960]   stubbornness of my heart, in order to destroy the watered land with the dry.'"
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.120]   So what is He referring to?
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.200]   He's warned the nation of Israel, after all the instructions, all the commandments, all
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.840]   the warnings that have been given to you, and then you enter the promised land and you
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:45.000]   drift to where everybody else is and you begin to worship idols.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.920]   And then you say, after all the warnings have been given, you say, "I'm good.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.520]   I'm at peace because nobody's trying to cut my throat.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.600]   We're not in the middle of war."
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.560]   So because the curse and the judgment is not today, He's like, "I'm at peace.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.000]   I'm good."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.280]   So what He is saying is that you are watering this root.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   You are tilling this root.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   You're paying attention.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.880]   And then the more you pay attention, the more you allow this to happen, what's going to
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.480]   come from that is dead fruit.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:25.400]   So what He means by, if you are not right with Christ, if you're a nominal Christian,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:32.200]   you've never fully surrendered your life to Christ, watering that life is only going to
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.960]   bear dead fruit.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.000]   That's what He means.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.580]   To let no root of bitterness spring up that causes trouble.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:49.680]   So a lukewarm life, a half-hearted pursuit, a nominal Christianity that has not surrendered
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.280]   to Christ, the fruit that it will bear is going to be bitterness.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.180]   The reasons why churches split is because the fruit of bitterness, because they cultivated
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.440]   nominal Christianity.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.680]   The reason why there's turmoil, the reason why so many pastors are falling now is because
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.620]   they've allowed the root of bitterness.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:16.900]   Because He was talented, He was gifted, the church was growing, He was articulate.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.460]   And so we've allowed things that we shouldn't allow in the church, and the fruit that's
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:27.740]   coming out of that is because the root of bitterness was cultivated in the church.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.820]   That's what He's referring to.
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:35.580]   More than our horizontal relationship, He's talking about the vertical relationship.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:42.820]   Because without peace with God, you can't have peace with mankind.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:51.640]   Hebrews 2.3, "How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?"
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.500]   The greatest concern in our generation where you and I live are not people who've heard
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:04.060]   the gospel and were hostile and hated us, because they knowingly rejected the gospel.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.780]   I think the greatest tragedy are people who are going to stand in front of the judgment
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.700]   seat simply because they neglected such a great salvation.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.160]   Simply because they didn't have time.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.940]   They were too busy.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:23.040]   They postponed it till later, and they just drifted into the world.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:31.980]   The temptation when we're young is to think that we are billionaires with our time.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.860]   When we're young, we know we're not going to live forever, but we live like we're going
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.100]   to live forever.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.460]   If you're a billionaire, you're not going to sweat it if you get in a car accident,
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:48.100]   or you lose $10,000, because you're a billionaire.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.460]   You spend money freely because you have all this reserve in the bank account.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:59.980]   When we're young, our temptation is to think you can spend 10 hours watching Netflix, and
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.940]   watching three, four hours of video games every single day, because you have all the
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.940]   time in the world.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:12.300]   There's a reason why the Bible says to teach us to number our days.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.820]   Ask anybody who's a bit older how quickly time passes.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.320]   It's quick.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.540]   In my mind, I'm 20.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   In my mind.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:30.700]   I remember the first time, because we love basketball so much when we're young.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.700]   Think about it.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.700]   I'm a committed Christian.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.580]   Internet wasn't created then.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.260]   TV turned off at 1 p.m.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:45.180]   What is a committed Christian going to do outside of ... We play basketball.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.460]   I remember playing basketball, and I reached a certain age.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.420]   In my mind, I can go around this guy easily.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.300]   I'm not the biggest guy, but I'm quick.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.660]   I can dribble around him, and I can lay up.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.660]   I was a decent outside shooter.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.660]   I was shooting.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.460]   I remember one day, in my mind, I went around him, but physically, I went right through
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460]   him.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.300]   I said, "Shoot.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.460]   That never happened before."
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.260]   I'm playing softball.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.620]   I always played right field.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.300]   For 15, 16 years, I played right field.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   The ball was hit.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.540]   Just a little lob to the right field.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.500]   I was casually running there, because I knew I caught this 1,000 times.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:26.220]   I missed it by 20 feet, because my legs were going to get me there.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.220]   My body was telling me, "It's up.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   That's it.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.220]   Go to the infield."
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:36.100]   Then, from the infield, I had to pitch.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   It goes by quick.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.740]   Literally, it feels like a mist.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:48.380]   The danger is, when you're young, you don't see time as something valuable.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:53.780]   Instead of investing your time, you just spend your time.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:59.460]   Next thing you know, 10, 20, 30, 40 years go by, and then you're trying to tell your
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.300]   kids, "Don't do that.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.820]   Don't make the mistake that I made."
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.980]   Be wise.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.620]   Listen to counsel early.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.260]   At your deathbed, what would you tell yourself?
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:18.740]   When you're in your 30s and 40s, you're so busy taking care of kids.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.060]   You can't wait until the next day.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.060]   "Oh, the kids.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.540]   Once they go to school, I would have some free time."
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.660]   You're so busy.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:32.540]   That's when the rat race really is full force.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   It's interesting that, whenever we compare morality, we always compare with people who
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.860]   are worse than us.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.740]   It's like, "Yeah, Ian, I know I cheat, but at least I didn't kill anybody."
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:50.620]   Whenever we compare morality, we always choose somebody who's worse than us.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]   "At least I'm not like them.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:58.260]   I know I'm not the best Christian, but at least I go to church."
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.060]   For whatever reason, when it comes to money, we always compare with people above us.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.020]   We're all filthy rich.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.340]   We're just like, "Man, I have more than them."
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.260]   Usually, it's like, "I don't have as much as that guy."
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:16.620]   For morality, we compare with people worse than us because it makes us feel better.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.100]   When it comes to finances, we're always comparing with people who have more than us.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.620]   Even if we're filthy rich, we never feel rich.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.740]   That's a tendency during that period of 30, 40, where we use the excuse of, "Well, it's
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.740]   for my children.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.740]   It's for our families.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.740]   It's for our security.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.740]   It's for safety."
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:42.140]   You invest all that time pursuing worldly things, convinced that it's for godliness.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:46.300]   Then that time passes.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.540]   You know what happens?
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.100]   Bitter roots.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.500]   It was not founded upon Christ.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.060]   Christian and non-Christian use the same reasoning to pursue the world.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:06.020]   Then, when you get older, the temptation is, "I'm old now.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   About to retire, or I am retired."
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.740]   Those are for kids, college kids, passionately.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.940]   Street evangelism, that's for kids.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.980]   Passionately making disciples, going on missions.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.860]   That's what young people do.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:29.900]   So we have a tendency to kind of have a retired mindset, and then just enjoy life, talk about
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.900]   what we used to do.
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   Esther always says my favorite word is "used to."
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.260]   "I used to do that.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.060]   I used to do this."
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.540]   That's the temptation when we get older, as if the race is already over, and we're just
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.060]   waiting to get to heaven.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:55.260]   In every stage of life, our enemy plants seeds in our heads, to ultimately to do what?
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:00.380]   To stop passionately pursuing this grace of God.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:05.740]   That's what he means when he says, "Let no one fall short of the grace of God."
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.020]   This is a command not to treat the grace of God lightly.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:16.620]   Take seriously that this period of time that we have, in light of eternity, there's nothing
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:25.000]   more important that we must do than to give all our attention for God's glory.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.800]   That the lost in Christ may come to Christ.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:32.680]   That those who do not know Christ may hear the voice of God, and they also would come.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.380]   Those who have given themselves to false Christianity in the church, that they would be waken up
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:43.180]   from their slumber, and to meet the God of life.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:49.340]   Those of you who are fatigued, to persevere, to re-examine the glory that opened your eyes,
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.940]   that caused you to come to him.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:58.580]   That we would continue to strive, wherever we are, to see Christ, and to Christ alone.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:04.580]   Fix your eyes upon Christ, the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.860]   Let's pray.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:15.900]   Again, as our worship team comes, I want to invite you to take some time to pray, examine,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:23.180]   and if you are an unbeliever, at least ask and seek.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:28.220]   Maybe at the end of this, you might come to the conclusion that this is the biggest lie.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.620]   But to pursue, to seek, to ask.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:38.580]   And if all this is true, that God is offering salvation to you, and all he asks is that
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:45.720]   you recognize that you have fallen, that you are in desperate need of his forgiveness.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:53.020]   To confess your sins, ask God for forgiveness, receive this grace.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:51:00.520]   Those of you who are nominal Christians, and you committed, you committed to have the best
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:09.420]   of this world, and to the best of God, knowing full well the Bible says it is impossible.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.060]   You cannot serve mammon and God at the same time.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:19.980]   To take a step back, examine, where is my faith, what do I believe?
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.540]   And to pursue Christ with all our might.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:26.700]   And those of you who are fatigued, have you forgotten what it is that you have in Christ?
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:31.900]   When was the last time you truly celebrated your salvation, the son of God?
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:38.500]   When was the last time you closed your eyes just to thank God for what he's done already?
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:42.740]   Let's pray.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:52.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
