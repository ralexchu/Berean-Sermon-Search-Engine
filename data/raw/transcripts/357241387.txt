[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   Okay, Hebrews chapter 5 verses 1 through 10, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.880]   to God in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.060]   He can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided since he himself also is beset with weakness.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.700]   And because of it, he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins as for the people, so
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.720]   also for himself.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.960]   And no one takes honor to himself but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960]   was.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.180]   So also Christ did not glorify himself so as to become a high priest, but he who said
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.760]   to him, "You are my son; today I have begotten you."
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.380]   Just as he says also in another passage, "You are a priest forever according to the order
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.380]   of Melchizedek."
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.040]   And again, 7 through 10 is where we're going to be focused this morning.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.340]   In the days of his flesh, he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.600]   and tears to the one able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his piety.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.060]   Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.260]   And having been made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.780]   salvation, being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780]   Let's pray.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.420]   Father, we've gathered here together to honor you, to worship you, to hear from you.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.020]   Help us, Lord God, to have open ears, softened hearts, to listen, to understand, and to obey.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220]   May Christ and his suffering bear fruit, Lord God, even today.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.460]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.840]   If I was to ask you, if you were to think back in your Christian life, whether you've
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.740]   been a Christian for a year or 10 years or longer than that, 20, 30 years, what has made
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.580]   the biggest impact in your life?
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.580]   Was it a sermon?
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.820]   Was it a book you read?
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.520]   Was it some particular person who invested their time into your life?
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.360]   What has made the biggest impact?
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.300]   You know, when I think about out of the years that I've been a Christian, what image do
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.380]   I have in my head that has made the biggest impact that I remember?
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.540]   And if I tell you what made the biggest impact, you're going to think it's kind of trivial,
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.580]   you know, because even as I tell it, it's going to sound trivial.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.480]   But the image that I have in my head that made the biggest impact or made a deep impact
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.220]   in my life was when I was 19 years old, my former youth pastor, who used to be my youth
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.100]   pastor when I was in high school, you know, I met him in college and then he asked if
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.820]   I would like to be discipled by him.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.940]   And of course, I was hungry at that time and said, "Yes, I mean, if you're willing to meet
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.620]   up with me, I would."
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.280]   But he was a man who didn't necessarily have obvious gifts.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.660]   In fact, as a youth pastor, he was not liked by the youth at all.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.980]   You know, he had broken English and he tried too hard.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.740]   He had a bunch of teenagers, you know, who were like hormones going crazy.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.340]   And he would come and he would try too hard to kind of like be one of us and be cool and
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.100]   it kind of backfired on him.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.460]   And so every time he tried to meet up with the students and the students just like, "Oh,
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.140]   that guy," you know, and so he basically just kind of lost control of the group.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.400]   But I appreciated his effort.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.620]   And so by the time I came to college, when he asked to meet up, he's like, "Yeah, I mean,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620]   that's what I want.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.260]   I want to grow."
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.540]   I would say he probably made the biggest impact in my life, but I can't remember a single
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660]   sermon he gave.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.020]   I can't remember a single thing that he said to me that I remember today.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.500]   It's like, "Oh, because of him."
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.260]   You know, I don't remember because that's not what impacted me.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.020]   And when I think of how he impacted me, it was more from just watching him.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.940]   Again, like I said, he wasn't a gifted man.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.860]   He wasn't like a dynamic leader.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.780]   He wasn't a type of guy that can stand in front of a large crowd and gather attention.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.380]   But I remember specifically this one retreat that we went to when I was 19 years old, and
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.500]   there was a bunch of people who gathered and waiting for the, you know, the head leaders
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   to show up.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.580]   And it was kind of chaotic.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.300]   And I forget, it was 100 or 200 people, we're sitting around, and something needed to be
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.140]   done, but nobody wanted to, you know, everybody was kind of awkward and didn't know what to
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140]   do.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.140]   And so my discipler, he kind of stepped up and because there was a need, it was chaotic,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.620]   and he tried to organize people, and he was trying to be silly and playing games and asking
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.660]   people to do this, and it wasn't working.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.820]   He made an awkward situation much more awkward.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.620]   And I remember sitting watching that, you know, just kind of feeling uncomfortable.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.900]   And I think you guys have all been in similar situation, and we were all just like, "What
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.900]   is he doing?"
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.700]   You know, he's making a fool of himself.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.500]   But again, the reason why that made such an impact on me was because as I was observing
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.380]   him, the only reason why he was doing that, and I think he was very aware that it wasn't
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.780]   working.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.100]   And I think he was very aware that people were snickering and kind of like, "What is
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.100]   this fool doing?"
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.340]   You know, he was making a fool of himself.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.140]   But I remember sitting there watching him thinking, "Man, the only reason why he's doing
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.940]   that is because there was a need," and he just kind of stepped up.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.100]   And again, like I said, even as I tell it, he's like, "You got impacted by that?"
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.780]   But the reason why it made such a deep impression in me is it was just purely out of...there
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.820]   was a necessity.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.420]   He wasn't trying to get glory.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.380]   It wasn't because he was good at it.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.660]   It wasn't because he was effective.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.960]   It was just...he was just a man who was faithful, who was just serving and doing his job.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.740]   And I remember thinking to myself, "That's the kind of man I want to be.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.000]   I want to be somebody who just serves because I love Christ."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.100]   You know, our natural tendency, even in the context of serving Christ, our natural tendency
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.260]   is to want glory.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.740]   And that's not just to some people.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.500]   That's every single one of us because that's at the root of our rebellion.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   Our root of our rebellion is to idolize mankind, idolize ourselves, wanting to be recognized.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.320]   And so that's why we shop for clothing.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.980]   That's why we want to get better education.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.320]   That's why we want to make more money because our natural inclination is to get recognition,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.960]   even in the context of doing God's work.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   Remember, when Jesus was going to the cross, he was telling his disciples he's going to
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.560]   be beaten and crucified.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   And the only thing that the disciples were thinking is, "Who's going to sit to the left
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.880]   and who's going to sit to the right?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.420]   Who's the greatest?"
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.480]   So it was by no accident that the very last image that Jesus left to his disciples before
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.360]   he went to the cross was him on his knees serving them.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.520]   He was washing their feet and he said, "Not only am I doing this," he says, "if you want
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.560]   to be my disciples, you will need to do this for each other."
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.840]   So that was not by accident that Jesus did that.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.000]   He said, "You know, this is a great lesson.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.720]   I forgot to tell you this."
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.680]   He left that impression upon them as their Lord, as their Messiah, to humble ourselves
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.920]   because he knows that our natural inclination is to magnify ourselves.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.640]   Now the text that we're looking at this morning is talking about Jesus' suffering.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.720]   I'm going to start with verse 8.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   We're going to get back to verse 7 because verse 8 kind of summarizes what Jesus did
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.480]   to become a sympathetic high priest.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.360]   We talked about last week how a high priest needed to be a man.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.300]   He needed to be a man who was appointed.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.480]   And as a result of that, he needed to be a gentle.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.760]   He neither...it was apathetic towards sin, nor was he harsh towards sinners.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   He was in the middle.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   He was able to be gentle.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   So this week, we're looking at verse 8, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to describe in detail what does
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.480]   that suffering look like?
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.880]   How did he become this gentle high priest?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.480]   Well, it says in verse 5, 8, "Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.440]   which he suffered."
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.160]   Let me stop right there.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.920]   That phrase, you probably have read it many times, maybe you have even memorized it.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.000]   Think about what this is a description of, who this description is.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.680]   Though he was a son, we're not talking about just any son, he's the son of the living God.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:35.080]   In other words, Christ is God himself, is described as a man who is learning to obey
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.560]   in his suffering.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.440]   Every single one of those words does not fit the son of God.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.320]   The son of God had to learn.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.140]   The son of God had to obey.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.960]   The son of God had to suffer.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   It doesn't fit.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.160]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:58.280]   In Psalm 147, verse 5, it describes the God that you and I worship, the son of God.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.080]   Great is our Lord, and abundant in strength.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.040]   His understanding is infinite.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.880]   If you want to find passages in the Old Testament about the omniscience of God, I mean, you'll
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.480]   find tons and tons because there's passage after passage.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.760]   There's event after event to describe our God as being omniscient, knowing all things,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.440]   and yet he said, "Jesus humbled himself and he learned."
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.520]   A God who knows everything had to learn.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   In Colossians 1:16-18, Jesus Christ is the creator and he is completely omnipotent.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.920]   For by him all things were created, both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.960]   In other words, there's nothing above him.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.360]   He's completely omnipotent.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   All things have been created through him and for him.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He is before all things and in him all things hold together.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   There is nothing above him.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.060]   All things were created by him and all things are for him and all rulers and all authorities
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.680]   and all things hold together because of him.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.760]   He is completely omnipotent.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.160]   And yet, it says, not only did he learn, he learned obedience.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.480]   Obey what?
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.160]   How can a God who is on the top of the hill?
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:22.480]   How can a God who has all kings, all rulers subjected under him have to obey?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   And then he suffered.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.880]   Isaiah 40, 28-29, he says, "Do you not know, have you not heard, the everlasting God, the
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.480]   Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, does not become weary or tired.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.220]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.200]   He gives strength to the weary and to him who lacks might, he increases power.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.480]   He's the one who strengthens the weary.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.280]   He's the one that people run to when they need power."
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.100]   And yet, he says, he suffered.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.160]   So this statement that although he was son, Jesus, he learned obedience from the things
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   which he suffered does not make sense.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.680]   How can that be a description of the same person?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.200]   How can an omniscient, omnipotent, immutable God learn obedience through suffering?
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:22.400]   I mean, I think the perfect example of that is we find in Luke 2, 45-47.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.360]   The backdrop behind this is Jesus' mother and father, Joseph and Mary, they, being a
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   good Jew, decided to go down and make a journey to Jerusalem to practice one of their festivals.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.340]   And while they're there, you know, they do their thing and then they go back.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.960]   And on their way back home, after a couple of days on the way back home, they realize
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.780]   that Jesus is not with them.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.020]   So just in case we think like, "Well, that's a really bad mother," you know what I mean?
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.860]   How do you lose your son for two days and not recognize that, right?
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.760]   You have to understand that when they probably made that journey, they did it with probably
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.860]   their whole clan, maybe their grandfather, grandmother, aunt, uncle, cousins, and I don't
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.860]   know exactly how many people were with them, but my guess is it was a huge caravan, right?
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.400]   Maybe 20, maybe 30, maybe 50 of them, I don't know.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.580]   But they went together and it was a large enough group where they didn't recognize him.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.180]   They did not recognize him gone.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:18.400]   So he was probably a preteen, about 11 or 12 by the time that this is written.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.440]   So when they recognize that he is not there, they go back to Jerusalem and it takes them
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.760]   three days to find him because they didn't know where he was.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   And that's the backdrop.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.400]   In verse 45, it says, "When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem looking for
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   him.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.560]   And in those days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.140]   listening to them and asking them questions.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.320]   And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers."
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   This is omniscient, omnipotent, immutable God sitting under the teaching of the very
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.800]   teachers that in his ministry he's going to rebuke.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.920]   He said all of these Pharisees, all of these scribes, all of these supposed teachers of
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   the temple.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.200]   He says of them, "They sit in the seat of Moses."
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:09.040]   So listen to what they have to say, but do not do what they do because they're hypocrites.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.720]   Everything that they do, they do for men to see.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   And it is these same people that he subjects himself under and he's listening, asking questions
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.680]   and learning.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.100]   Some of these people are going to be the same people who are going to crucify him.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.320]   In about 20 years' time, Jesus knowing this, as a young man, he subjects himself to learn
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.840]   under these hypocrites.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   Verse 51, "And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and he continued in subjection
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   to them.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   And his mother treasured all these things in his heart and Jesus kept increasing in
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.680]   wisdom and stature in favor with God and men."
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.280]   That picture alone, I mean, you know, we have so many things about Christianity that, you
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   know, sometimes we have and it's like, "Oh, I can't understand why there's hell.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.360]   I can't understand why there's suffering."
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.440]   To me, all of those things have obvious answers, you know, and I don't think it's that difficult,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.040]   to be honest.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.720]   The answer is pretty easy.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   The God of the universe, who is perfect in nature, is offended and angry with sinners
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.680]   who are rebelling against him and so he's bringing judgment.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.820]   That's the answer.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.480]   We may not like it, but that's the answer.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.320]   But the real question behind the gospel is not why is there judgment because that's pretty
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.120]   clear if we understand who he is and understand who we are.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.240]   The real question is, why would the King of Kings and Lord of Lords submit himself to
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   these people?
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.560]   Why would he be in a position where he needs to learn and to obey and to suffer?
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.220]   That's the big question.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.540]   When he says he learned obedience through suffering, I think the obvious application
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.960]   of that or illustration of that is at Gethsemane.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:12.800]   You know, the word Gethsemane, the title, literally means "olive press" because that's
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.880]   where they collected olives and then they pressed it to make oil.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.800]   And that's exactly what happens to Jesus at Gethsemane, where he gets pressured and by
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.780]   his crushing, life comes for us.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:34.760]   In Matthew chapter 26, 38-39, we have a description of what takes place.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.840]   Jesus says to them, the disciples, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.920]   Remain here and keep watch with me."
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.080]   And if you don't know the background, Jesus is about to go to the cross that very morning
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.840]   and he is in anguish and he's asking his disciples to join him in prayer.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.880]   And when he went a little beyond them, fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.320]   if it is possible, let this cup pass from me."
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.680]   The cup he is referring to, the cup he is asking the Lord to may it pass.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.400]   If it is possible, may it pass.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.320]   This is the same cup that was prepared and prophesied from Genesis.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   From Genesis.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.840]   As soon as Adam and Eve fell, there was a prophecy that the seed of the woman is going
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.520]   to come and he is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.640]   It was prophesied and ordained from Genesis.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.560]   It is that cup he is praying and saying, "Is it possible for this to pass?"
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.680]   Jesus has been telling his disciples that he's going to come and drink this cup.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.160]   His whole purpose of his existence, why he came and why he was born, why he lived, why
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.480]   he called his disciples, was to drink this cup.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.760]   But as he is in anguish about the suffering about to come, he is pleading with his Father,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.920]   "Is there a way to pass this cup?"
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.560]   When the Bible talks about how he suffered, he learned obedience.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.960]   I mean, this is the extent of his suffering that everything that he came to do, but as
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:14.400]   a human being, as a man, just like any one of us, faced with suffering, he was asking
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.640]   his Father, "Is there another way?"
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.760]   You know what's crazy here?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.360]   He says, "Let this cup pass from me, yet not as I will, but as you will."
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.060]   You know what that means?
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:31.860]   At that moment, in his weakness, in his flesh, it was not his will to go to the cross.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.340]   At that moment, I mean, you want to see his weakness.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.340]   I mean, there it is right there.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:44.220]   God ordained, God prepared, deliberately has come, prophesied, telling his disciples, preparing
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:52.020]   to go to the cross, and in his weakness, he's crying out, "Is there a way for this cup to
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.060]   pass?
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.800]   Not my will, but your will be done."
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.460]   Why did he do this?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.740]   For what purpose?
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.060]   Why would a God of the universe put him in that situation?
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.780]   Isaiah 53, 5, "But he was pierced through for our transgressions.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.480]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.060]   The chastening for our well-being fell upon him, and by his scourging, we are healed."
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.840]   This is what makes us Christian, that we see his suffering, that he didn't just suffer
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.100]   for mankind, he suffered for me.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.140]   He put himself in that situation because of me, because of my sin.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.580]   My sin made it necessary for him to learn obedience through his suffering.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:44.620]   Every child who's born in this world is born with an instinct to live.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.220]   Anybody who has children, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.940]   As soon as they're born, you don't sit there in the delivery room teaching them how to
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.300]   eat.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.740]   You don't teach them how to suck.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.100]   They come out wanting to eat.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:04.060]   There is a natural instinct to survive, and that instinct to survive never dies.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:09.880]   Until the day that we have our last breath, we have instinctively a desire to live.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.300]   And this instinct to live is what causes us to stay away from danger.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.660]   If suffering is coming, we do at all costs try to avoid that.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.900]   So when we buy a house, if the neighborhood is not safe, that's not where we go.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.460]   If we go to a certain part of the country where there's danger of certain kind of measles
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:33.060]   or malaria, we avoid it or we get shot.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:38.300]   We buy insurance just in case something tragic happens and that we can't control to minimize
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.880]   the damage.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.340]   So every instinct that we have, we want to avoid suffering.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.500]   Jesus did not get here because He made some poor choices.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   Jesus did not get here because He didn't have the wisdom to avoid it.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.860]   He walked into this.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.500]   He planned to do this.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.860]   And yet, as He was facing the cross in His flesh, He cried out to His Father, "Is this
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.980]   the only way?"
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.420]   Isaiah 53, 7, "He was oppressed and He was afflicted, and yet He did not open His mouth
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.140]   like a lamb that is led to a slaughter and like a sheep that is silent before His shearers,
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.580]   so He did not open His mouth."
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:27.740]   He volunteered for this, even in His anguish, even as He was crying out to His Father.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.260]   And that's what it means when it says that He learned obedience in His suffering.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.020]   As He was suffering in His weakness of His flesh, just like any other human being would
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:44.060]   cry out and look for an escape, Jesus was like any of us.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.980]   Yet His prayer didn't end with, "Lord, save me from this."
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.860]   Though that was in His heart, though that was His instinct, just like any one of us,
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.840]   it ended with, "But not My will, but let Your will be done."
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.080]   That's what it means when the Scripture says He was tempted in every way, yet without sin,
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.980]   that even in His temptation, even in His intense anguish, He never gave into His flesh, He
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.380]   gave into the Lord's will.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.380]   In verse 7, it describes His anguish to another level.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:22.940]   Verse 7, "In the days of His flesh, as a human being, He offered up both prayers and supplication."
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:31.140]   For any other human being, a prophet, even angels, to pray and to offer supplication
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.860]   is obvious, it's noble.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.820]   But this is God.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.100]   There is no lack in Him.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.020]   There is nothing that He needs.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.540]   And yet, the reason why He prays, the word supplication basically means to plead, to
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.500]   plead for God to answer, for God to intervene.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.340]   So what would be obvious, what would be noble for any other human being, but for Jesus to
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.860]   be offering this prayer is an odd scene.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:07.940]   In Psalm 23, one of churches, Christians' favorite verses, "The Lord is my shepherd,
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.540]   I shall not want."
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.100]   In other words, I have no other need but Him.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.900]   I am complete with the Lord.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   He takes care of me.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.420]   He's my refuge.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.200]   In the presence of my enemies, He prepares a banquet for me.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.240]   But the reason why we're able to say that is because there is nothing that He cannot
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:33.500]   provide because He's the omnipotent, omniscient, all-powerful, immutable God.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.740]   And so if I have Him, I have everything.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.340]   That's what Psalm 23 means.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.340]   So He is it.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.020]   It's not like we go through Him to get something else.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.020]   He is the answer.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.140]   And the reason we love that passage is because if we have Him, we have everything.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:55.620]   And the reason why if we have Him, we have everything is because He lacks nothing.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.620]   He doesn't lack wisdom.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.120]   He doesn't lack power.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.560]   He doesn't lack knowledge.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.940]   He lacks nothing.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:09.140]   And for that omnipotent, omniscient, immutable, all-powerful God, in His flesh, He offered
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.300]   up prayers and supplication, pleading.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.020]   He puts Himself in a place where He was in need.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.860]   He humbled Himself deliberately.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:26.300]   And every once in a while, it makes news when somebody who's famous and who's multimillionaire,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.060]   with all the money in the world, that we expect them to be flying out and flying around in
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:36.660]   private jets or limousine with chauffeurs, and then we catch a glimpse of them on a subway,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660]   like everybody else.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.980]   It makes a big deal.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.260]   Keanu Reeves, right?
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:49.420]   They got a video of him in the New York subway, and this guy's been a big movie star for,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.820]   what, three decades now?
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.740]   Maybe more?
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:59.820]   And they catch a glimpse of him on the subway, riding like everybody else.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.340]   And the only difference between him and us is he's better looking.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.820]   I'm not going to say anything about his acting.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.060]   He's very good looking, right?
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:17.060]   A great guy, nice guy, you know, it's not to knock him, but the world is just flipping
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:23.620]   over over this guy because you don't expect him to be riding a subway.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.700]   You don't expect him to be nice like everybody else.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:34.860]   He's a multimillionaire adored by the world because he's good looking.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:46.540]   We as a world fawn over people for being a bit humble, and yet when we think about our
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:52.500]   Lord, God of the universe, who humbled himself, became a man.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.700]   And not just a man, but humbled himself to the point of being ridiculed and suffered
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:04.460]   on the cross, crying out in tears, it says, to the one who was able to save him from death.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.980]   Why does he even have to pray?
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.300]   He's the author of life.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:14.380]   Why does he even pray to God to save him from death?
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.740]   It was already his.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.380]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.340]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.700]   Nobody comes to the Father but through me.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.140]   He says he is life.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.140]   He says he has come to give life and give this life abundantly, and yet in Gethsemane
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:37.100]   he is praying with supplication, pleading with God, crying out with tears.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.780]   Those tears wasn't because he made bad choices.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.020]   Those tears wasn't because he made the wrong turn somewhere or something tragic happened
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.100]   to him.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.780]   Those tears were for us.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:57.500]   He put himself in that situation to save us.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:03.060]   Only time that we've seen Jesus weep like that in the Bible is two other places.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.220]   One is in front of the Lazarus' tomb.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.380]   Jesus comes and he tells them that he's going to bring him back from the dead, and people
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.460]   are weeping, and before he calls him out, he weeps.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.740]   Why is he weeping?
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.820]   He deliberately came late to the tomb.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.380]   He already told them that this is not going to lead to death.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.900]   He's about to bring him from the tomb, but why is he weeping?
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.780]   I believe he's weeping for the same reason.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   In all three instances of his weeping, it's the same.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:38.460]   He's standing before the tomb because the death of man is the most tangible evidence
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.860]   of the curse of man, because God said, "If you break this command, if you do not obey,"
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.460]   he says, "you shall surely die."
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.460]   And death has reigned over mankind from then on until now.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:58.100]   And so in the presence of death, not specifically Lazarus' death, Jesus is weeping over mankind,
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.620]   I believe.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.460]   The second time we see him weeping is as he is riding his donkey into Jerusalem, and as
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.460]   people are parting, saying, "Oh, we're going to be delivered.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.500]   Finally, the Messiah is going to come, overthrow the Roman government."
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.540]   And yet Jesus is weeping.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.820]   If you only knew what would bring you true peace.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.620]   The peace you were referring to was not an overthrow of Roman government or easier life,
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.020]   or establish Israel as the greatest kingdom, because that's what they were looking for,
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.620]   and they completely missed the point.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.300]   Only if you really knew what would bring you peace.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:41.580]   But because you did not recognize the coming of Christ, and why he came, he said, "Judgment
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.580]   is coming."
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:50.360]   And it is over this judgment and destruction of Jerusalem that he was weeping over them.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:57.220]   And so here, when Jesus is crying out with tears, those tears wasn't simply because he
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.000]   was having a hard time.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.480]   He was crying out and tearing, praying, and offering supplication because he put himself
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.040]   in that position to save us.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.560]   What a strange, strange scene.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.780]   As I was preparing for this sermon, I was meditating and thinking about this.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:22.240]   Why would you do this for anybody?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.320]   Why would anybody do it?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's a strange thing to see somebody whose object of honor and worship to be in that
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   position.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.040]   You remember years ago when Kobe Bryant messed up his Achilles?
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.640]   That was a very strange scene.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.320]   Some of you guys who are Lakers fans may remember.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:47.680]   Because Kobe Bryant came into the league as a 17-year-old, cocky as ever.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.140]   I think he's much more humble now.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.560]   People say he was cocky.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:58.160]   He was…17-year-old Kobe was unbearable because they were comparing him to Michael Jordan,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   the greatest basketball player ever, period.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.560]   Truth, fact, right?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.320]   And they were saying, "Kobe Bryant is the next Michael Jordan."
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.480]   And so he's coming around 17 years old and, you know, people are trying to contain him
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.680]   and they wouldn't give him, you know, playing time, you know, early on because he was too
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   raw.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.640]   But eventually he got to playing time and then, yeah, he became a superstar almost immediately.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.280]   And all we've known of Kobe is making spectacular shots.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.000]   And as the years went by, even the unbelievers were beginning to say, it's like, "Maybe
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.520]   he is the next Michael Jordan."
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.600]   And that's all we've known of Kobe.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   That's all we've known.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:49.800]   And then all of a sudden, he breaks his Achilles and he's in that locker room, humbled.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.480]   All of a sudden, he has no words.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:56.760]   He's at the end of his career and there's nothing he can do to work himself, to will
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   himself.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.080]   There's no mamba mentality that was going to save him from his broken Achilles.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.560]   And it was a very, very strange scene because we've never seen that in Kobe because he was
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.680]   always on a pedestal.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.800]   As long as we've known him, he was always on a pedestal.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.880]   He was the one bailing, you know, Lakers out.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.320]   He was the one winning championships.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.360]   He was one on the table, you know, flashing his jersey number.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:35.160]   But as strange as that scene was, the son of God crying out in tears, pleading to save
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:44.680]   him from death, is a mystery that will take eternity for us to realize.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:51.080]   Why would the son of God do that for us?
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:59.320]   And that mystery should keep us asking and in wonder and worship for all eternity.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.300]   That is a love that you and I cannot possibly begin to comprehend.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.680]   We can say it's like this, it's like my mother's, it's like my grandfather's, it was like this.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:16.720]   But all of that are grossly, grossly imperfect in comparison to what Christ has done.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.560]   He says, "Jesus prayed to God who was able to save him from death."
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:26.320]   He prayed to God in Mark chapter 14, 37 to 38.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.620]   In his humanity, just like any of us, when we are suffering, we are looking for partners
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.180]   and other people to suffer with us or at least sympathize with us.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.320]   And that's exactly what Jesus did.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.260]   He says in verse 37, "Simon, are you asleep?
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.840]   Could you not keep watch for me for one hour?"
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.560]   You know, I don't believe Jesus was trying to disciple them at this moment.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:54.380]   I think Jesus, in his suffering, genuinely wanted the support and sympathy of his friends.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.920]   Those were his closest companions.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.280]   And as he was crying out to God, he wanted his friends to join him.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.320]   "Could you not pray with me?
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.220]   Didn't I tell you what's coming?
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.000]   Didn't I tell you what's about to happen?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.260]   I'm about to be crucified.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.180]   The very people that I came to love are going to whip me and beat me, and they're going
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.780]   to nail me to the cross.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.640]   Could you not pray with me for one minute, for one hour?"
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:28.180]   He says, "Your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak."
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.240]   Every single one of us.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.260]   We may have good intentions.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:39.440]   We may have desire, but we will always fall short in our flesh.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.920]   We may have every intention to be holy.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.660]   We may have every intention to be gracious.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.940]   We may have every intention to be a better father, to be a better son, to be a better
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.420]   husband, to be a better wife.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:59.640]   And we may have that intention, but only God could save us from our own sins.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.040]   And he says, "Because of his piety, he heard him."
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.380]   What does it mean, "he heard him"?
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.340]   Because he was crucified.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.980]   What does it mean, "he heard him because of his piety"?
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.980]   The word for piety literally means, and the NIV is the only one who translated it this
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.060]   way, "because of his reverent submission."
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:23.060]   In the NASB, it says "piety," in the King James, it says "fear," but literally, it means
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.860]   "reverent submission."
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.960]   Instead of demanding security, demanding, and Jesus, if anybody was justified to demand
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.500]   that he be delivered, it would have been Christ.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.980]   None of us, no matter what we had, there is no way we can ever come to a holy God, demand
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   anything.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.620]   How can you be unfair?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.100]   Don't ever pray that prayer.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.020]   Don't ever come to a holy God and say, "God, you're unfair."
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.460]   And if God says, "You want me to be fair?"
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.500]   My children ever say, "It's unfair, okay, let's be fair from now on."
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.220]   This is how much it's going to cost to live in my house.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.340]   This is how much your car costs.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.140]   This is how much it costs to raise you.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   "You want to be fair?"
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.140]   It's like, "No, I don't want fair."
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.020]   You don't want fair, you don't want justice.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:17.260]   You definitely don't want that when you come before God.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.980]   Sinners can only beg for mercy.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.980]   Sinners can only beg for grace.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:29.140]   If there's one person who could have asked and demanded justice was Christ.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:35.780]   Yet as he came before God, he humbled himself in reverent submission.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.460]   What does it mean that he heard him?
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.100]   Clearly it wasn't that he saved him from the cross because it was the Lord's will.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.740]   It was God's will to crush him.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:53.900]   Our problem of mankind, even though so much of our prayer is to make this life better,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.540]   is not the length of our life.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.900]   Whether you die when you're 80 years old or 90 years old, whether you die when you're
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.020]   15 or 10, that's not the problem of mankind.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.180]   Whether you live a healthy life or a difficult life, whether you live nicely in a nice home
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:13.260]   or whether you're homeless, because all of this is temporary, that is not the problem
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.660]   of mankind.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:20.140]   The quality of life, the length of life is not our greatest problem.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.320]   It's the second death that the Bible describes.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.360]   In as much as it is appointed for all men to die once, after this comes judgment.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.220]   So when Jesus pled with his Father to save him from death, he's not simply talking about
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.500]   the cross.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.920]   It's the effect of every sinner who dies with sin.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.260]   And when he says he was answered because of his reverent submission, he's talking about
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.740]   his resurrection.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.380]   That he didn't stay dead.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:57.340]   He was resurrected and his name was exalted high above every other name.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:06.380]   When we recognize that, when we recognize our greatest problem is our sin, our prayers
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.780]   are all answered already.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.740]   Our prayers are all answered already.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:18.260]   Now we may struggle with these trivial things, that in the path of eternal life, I want to
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.100]   have a better seat.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:26.380]   It's like somebody who's been saved from Titanic and you get on this boat to get to safety
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:30.620]   and then you're wrestling with who gets to have the nice window view as you're headed
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.140]   home.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:38.020]   That's how our prayers are sometimes so trivial.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.420]   Because sometimes we're fighting to see who gets to sit in the captain's seat, who gets
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:50.460]   the window seat, who gets to get the better snacks, all on the way to safety.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.740]   When we recognize that our greatest problem is not the length or the quality of this life,
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.980]   but it's our sins and the effects of sin.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.100]   And this is the reason why Christ came.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:13.180]   Why we see this strange scene of our Savior humbled, crying out in tears, pleading for
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180]   safety.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.540]   Hebrews chapter 5, 9 through 10, it says, "And having been made perfect, he became to
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:22.580]   all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as high
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.060]   priest according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.860]   Now we'll get a bit more deeper into Melchizedek when we get to chapter 7.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.460]   But here when it says, "He was made perfect," he wasn't made perfect because he was imperfect.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:42.620]   The word perfect, "Heleos," basically means God's appointed purpose to be brought to completion.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:48.940]   Christ humbled himself, emptied himself, became nothing, and through his suffering, obedience,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.700]   he became the perfect Savior for us.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.500]   There's only one person that qualifies to be our Savior.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   One person.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.820]   And his name is Jesus Christ.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:06.460]   And if we look anywhere else for refuge, anywhere else for rest, anywhere else for help, it
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.060]   is no different than Jesus going to his friends.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.860]   Couldn't you stay for one hour?
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:18.140]   They may have good intentions, they may be loving and gentle, they may be kind, but they
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.020]   cannot save us.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:26.260]   Only Christ fulfills that purpose.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:33.060]   All of his suffering, all of his humiliation, all of it was ordained for this purpose.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.140]   As Christ learned obedience through suffering, he became the source of salvation for those
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.500]   who obey him.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:46.700]   He learned what obedience looked like in the flesh, made weak.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.940]   In every way, he was tempted.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.340]   And you could see it in his prayer.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.780]   Can this cup pass from me?
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.980]   We could look at that and say, "Jesus, how can you pray that prayer?
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.060]   You put yourself in this.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.100]   You volunteered, you prophesied, you've been preparing your disciples for this, and yet
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:15.420]   in his flesh, just like any of us, can this cup pass from me?
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.560]   Not my will.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.660]   In his flesh, he experienced temptation to the point where he made no sense.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.580]   That prayer made no sense to everything that he did up to this point, but that's how tempted
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.940]   he was.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.500]   That's how weak he was.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.820]   That's how humble he became.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.340]   Yet without sin, not my will, your will be done.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:50.300]   All for the purpose to be able to say to us, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:58.260]   Come to me," because he is gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.380]   souls.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.300]   Are you restless?
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.300]   Are you restless?
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   You know, restlessness is revealed in all kinds of ways.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.620]   Depression, anxiety, anger, frustration.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.500]   Restlessness is found and expressed in all kinds of ways.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.340]   But in the end, it's because there is no rest in Christ.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.420]   Only Christ can save us from ourselves.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:37.180]   Let us draw near to the throne of grace so that we may find help in times of need.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:44.580]   Let's pray.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.080]   And as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray and come before the Lord
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.720]   in honest prayer and honest confession of where we are.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.860]   If our hearts have become hardened and the revelation of his suffering for us doesn't
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:06.260]   sound any different than hearing bad news on the news.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.500]   There's indifference, there's hardening.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.980]   That already shows that we've drifted away from God.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:16.140]   And if that's where we are, ask the Lord, soften our hearts.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:21.300]   What has caused our hearts to be callous when we hear the suffering of Christ and it does
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.900]   nothing other than to add more information, to plug up holes that you didn't understand
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.940]   about the cross.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.700]   And it doesn't cause you to have affection for him.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.900]   That already is a revelation that our hearts have drifted so far from God.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.220]   Let's be honest before the Lord in honest prayer and ask the Lord, "Lord, soften my
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.740]   heart.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:46.740]   Not only that I may understand, but that I may be impacted, that the revelation of Christ's
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:52.940]   suffering would cause me to desire to offer my body as a living sacrifice."
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.300]   So again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
