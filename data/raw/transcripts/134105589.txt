[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   Wisdom, however, not of this age nor the rulers of this age who are passing away.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.760]   the ages to our glory.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.200]   The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood, for if they had understood
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.140]   it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.940]   But just as it is written, things which eye has not seen or ear has not heard and which
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.420]   have not entered the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love him.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.080]   Let's pray and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.140]   God we thank you for your word.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.420]   We pray Lord, God that every time we open it up, that first of all our hearts will be
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.100]   prepared and that Lord we would cause our, we would determine in our hearts to really
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.340]   receive your truth, but also God through your spirit help us to understand.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.380]   God through your spirit help us to have conviction.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.100]   Help us to have lasting memory of the things that you teach us Lord through your word.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.740]   Father we thank you for your truth and we pray that we would gain much fruit from it
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.740]   today as we study.
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.380]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380]   Okay.
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.900]   So as we look at this passage, what I did was I did not like an extensive diagram, but
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.100]   I did a essentially a kind of a pseudo outline for us when I looked at verse six through
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.780]   nine and in our warmup I asked you guys to do the same thing, which is try in your simplest
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.620]   form to do an outline because it helps you understand the passage a lot.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.140]   If you want to get real technical, you could actually start diagramming each verse in ways
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.020]   when which you show each phrase has a connection to another, right?
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.860]   So you show the syntax basically between each word.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.820]   Here what I did was I was getting kind of a little bit confused by all the repetitive
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.700]   wording by this little paragraph.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.740]   And so what I did was I said, okay, verse six he's talking about, we're speaking about
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.980]   wisdom and wisdom happens to be the main thing.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.020]   Okay.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.060]   From that he describes what wisdom is and then he repeats himself in verse seven saying,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.600]   we speak this wisdom and he describes it again.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.740]   And then pertaining to this wisdom, he describes how, again, whether people understand it and
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.300]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.740]   So I want to begin by asking you as, as I tried to outline here that the wisdom is what
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.900]   he's trying to unpack.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.080]   Again, he's trying to describe this wisdom that he's now speaking of.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.620]   Question to you at first for a first point is what descriptions have you found from this,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.660]   these verses about wisdom?
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.780]   And that was the homework from the last week.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.780]   Okay.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.380]   What are the descriptions that you see of the wisdom that Paul speaks of in verse six
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.300]   through nine?
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   And if you haven't done it, take a moment to just start underlining real quick or maybe
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.660]   even numbering one, two, three.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.980]   What are the descriptions of wisdom from these four verses?
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:15.020]   And then as you find them, just yell it out.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.020]   Great.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.380]   That's part B of verse six.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.260]   It's not of this age nor the rulers of this age.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.260]   Okay.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.260]   What else?
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.260]   Great.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.900]   So jot these down if you want to, or again, underline and number.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.420]   It's secret and hidden.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.700]   The ESV, I believe it says secret and the NASB it says it's a mystery.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   Okay.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.860]   And that it's hidden wisdom.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.860]   What else?
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.860]   Great.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:50.200]   I'm glad you didn't just, you know, these are these little phrases.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.540]   It's both mystery and it's hidden, but then it was also predestined before the ages.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540]   Okay.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:07.660]   What else did you guys find?
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.780]   The wisdom is among those who are mature.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.780]   All right.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.820]   So the wisdom is spoken to those who are mature.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820]   What else?
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.820]   Okay.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.100]   Revealed through the spirit.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   What else?
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.980]   Okay.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.380]   So you guys can kind of see as we're doing this again, the main focal point, he's talking
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.980]   about this wisdom again, which essentially we've been talking about for the last several
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.260]   weeks.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.260]   But as you think about this wisdom, or as you think about how he's describing it, if
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.020]   you were to try to highlight certain major thoughts from that, like what are we supposed
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.260]   to gather from this description of wisdom?
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.060]   What's something that stands out?
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:04.380]   What's the general feel you guys is describing this?
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:14.940]   Great.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.980]   That's a great way to put it.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.500]   I would actually just kind of highlight that first part of what Alex said.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.780]   Alex said, this wisdom is not attainable without the spirit.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.500]   And that's exactly what Apostle Paul is trying to describe.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.860]   And that's something that we need to take a moment to think about and meditate on.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.580]   So one of the things that we should gather from this description of wisdom is it's not
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.620]   attainable by natural man.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.140]   And if you think about this for a moment, we're reminded that natural man, I guess,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.920]   or human wisdom has been incompetent.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.420]   And not only has it been incompetent for a long time, but broadly speaking, all of mankind
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.060]   has been incompetent.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.460]   And so if you look at that verse, looking at your Bibles, you know how one of the first
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.740]   descriptions that somebody mentioned was, it's not of this age or the rulers of this
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.080]   age.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.500]   If you think about this, he's talking about timeline in terms of this age or this generation.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.240]   But not only that, he says basically that it's all passing away.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120]   And so you get the sense of wisdom, okay?
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.980]   Wisdom is not attainable and it never has been because man's wisdom in total has been
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980]   incompetent.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.460]   We're weak for the entire time.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.120]   And there's a sense in which from the previous passages that we've studied in this book,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.780]   it was taught to us that whether we're trying to figure things out internally, whether we're
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.500]   trying to figure things out rationally, whether we're trying to figure things out experientially
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.100]   and empirically, we are not going to obtain to God.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.300]   And we're not only going to obtain to God, but we're not going to obtain to the things
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.780]   of the Lord by our own human measure.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   Okay?
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.700]   By our own human measure.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.860]   But as you think about that, I want to highlight something that's something that we've probably
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.140]   all known, but it is a little bit like shocking.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.540]   It is a little bit like not just in our common thought.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.580]   And that is this question.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.620]   Has God intentionally hidden his truth from people?
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.660]   It's a yes or no question.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.780]   You know the answer to this.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.900]   He has.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.620]   He calls this wisdom a mystery, which essentially the reason why there's this different translation
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.660]   of mystery or secret is because oftentimes it's translated mystery, but in its full sense
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.180]   of the word, it's like a secret.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.020]   It's something that's not like, "Oh, it's mysterious.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.660]   No one's going to ever figure it out."
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.940]   That's not the meaning behind it.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.460]   When they say mystery, it's more like it was hidden and it's to be revealed.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.460]   So essentially, what is that?
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.460]   A secret.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.460]   Okay?
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.660]   So he describes it in two terms, that it's a secret and it's hidden.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.820]   So in answering the question, has God ever withheld his truth, his wisdom from mankind?
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.340]   Yes, he has.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.960]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.300]   Do you know of any other references?
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.420]   Do you know of any other times when God has done this?
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.420]   Right.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.420]   Excellent.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:42.220]   So if you remember, when Jesus was on earth, Jesus started speaking in parables at a certain
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.540]   point and the disciples were like, "Why?"
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:52.300]   You know, I think it's actually good for us to go to that passage for a little bit in
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.300]   Matthew 13.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   Okay?
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.100]   So let's go to Matthew 13.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.300]   So go to your Bibles in Matthew 13.
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   Okay.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:15.180]   In Matthew 13, starting from verse 10, he says, "And the disciples came and said to
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.700]   him," so we're at Matthew 13, verse 10, "Why do you speak to them in parables?
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.480]   And Jesus answered them, 'To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.620]   of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.580]   For whoever has to him, more shall be given and he will have an abundance, but whoever
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.740]   does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.740]   Therefore I speak to them in parables because while seeing, they do not see, and while hearing,
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.700]   they do not hear, nor do they understand.'"
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.700]   Wow.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.620]   So he actually almost uses the same verbiage as we see here, or Apostle Paul uses the same
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.380]   verbiage that Jesus said.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.380]   Right?
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.380]   Why?
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.980]   Because they were actually quoting a passage in Isaiah.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.340]   Okay?
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.260]   If you guys remember, Isaiah was a prophet, a prophet of the Lord.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.000]   And Isaiah experienced an incredible scene with God on the throne.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.460]   But when Isaiah told God, "Here I am, send me," Isaiah said, "You're going to go, but
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.460]   guess what God said?
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.380]   They're not going to understand you."
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.060]   So what's really interesting about this passage is, as we look to this idea of men and their
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:30.800]   wisdom were incompetent, but God also intentionally withheld his wisdom.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:41.460]   And so what we learn from that is this idea that unless God grants, it's literally impossible.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.700]   Men will not reason, men will not have in their ingenuity, in their, you know, like
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.500]   investigation, they will never discover the truth of God.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.060]   They will never understand him.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:11:00.380]   And if you think about that, really it's just this idea like, how can a lesser creature
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.460]   understand a greater creature?
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.460]   Okay?
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.700]   How will a fly understand a cat?
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   You know?
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.380]   How will a cat understand a human person?
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.380]   How will a human person understand a divine being?
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.460]   You know, right now I'm living with Bia's parents and they have this dog that's cute
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.020]   because he's a small little white dog, but he's like insane.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.380]   He's nuts.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.060]   So if the garage door opens, just goes, you know, darting off, barking like crazy, he
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.060]   won't stop until you go over and you like grab him.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.980]   The gardeners come, the kids come out, everything.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.980]   He just goes nuts.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.580]   And I'm always thinking, why in the world do people have dogs?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.820]   Like this is, this is insane to me, you know?
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.780]   And, but one of the things that happens obviously is when you try to vacuum, it's like a whole
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.780]   nother story.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.300]   Like, it's worse than all the other stuff that's going on.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.700]   You start vacuuming and the dog just goes wild.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.900]   He's like biting at the vacuum.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.420]   He starts jumping on your leg and you're like, what are you doing?
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.780]   And then, you know, you try to hold him and you put him in his little like little room
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.780]   or whatever.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.780]   He starts going nuts.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.780]   He's clawing at the wall.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.940]   He just hates that vacuum, you know?
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.740]   And I'm sitting there like, what are you doing?
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.780]   Like my, my phrase, my favorite phrase at the house right now is like, what are you
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780]   doing?
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.780]   What are you doing?
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.780]   What are you doing?
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.780]   What are you doing?
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.780]   What are you doing?
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.780]   Dumb dog.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.780]   Like it's just the whole time, right?
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.260]   And Bia, he's, she's on the side just laughing cause I'm going like getting all frustrated.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.780]   And she's like, it's a dog.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.780]   What do you expect?
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.900]   You know, sermon illustration.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.660]   It's a dog.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.180]   How does a creature understand what the human is doing when he's trying to clean the house?
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.940]   You know, small creature is not going to understand something more advanced.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.020]   There's a sense in which no creature is going to reason to above his stature and then also
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.100]   all of a sudden reason to the Lord on high.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.740]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:54.100]   The thing about it is again, this whole passage we're talking about still connected to the
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.100]   idea of division and the division because of pride.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:06.180]   Remember that people are divided because of their arrogance and they need to be reminded
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.300]   you're not where you are because you discovered it.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.840]   You're not where you are because you figured it out.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.300]   You will not have any of this unless what the Lord grants it.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.380]   And that's the lesson.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:27.180]   And so we take those first couple of verses and I want to ask you, how would you summarize
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.220]   that first section from verse six through nine?
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.580]   How would you kind of encapsulate?
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.860]   Because for me that's part one of the outline and it's simplest form part one is what we
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.160]   just covered now in verse six through nine.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:56.220]   How would you summarize it?
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:22.460]   Something like a short phrase or one sentence.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.260]   I'm going to call on a few people to try.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.340]   How's about sincere?
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.700]   Okay, great.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.180]   The wisdom of God is, did you say profound?
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.180]   Yes.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.180]   Okay.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.180]   Wisdom of God is profound.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180]   What else?
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:15:03.860]   Any other way of summarizing that first section of verse six through nine?
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.820]   I'm going to call on a few guys.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:13.460]   How's about John Kim?
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:22.660]   You.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.660]   But is what?
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.660]   Okay.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.660]   So God's wisdom is profound.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.580]   It's hidden, but his spirit reveals.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.580]   Okay.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.900]   So I want us to think about that a little bit more.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.940]   Just kind of like soaking in the main point.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.940]   Okay.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.380]   I don't know if it was for you.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.980]   I've had you guys kind of read some of this section.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.220]   You know, this first several chapters, the first three chapters of first Corinthians,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.780]   it's actually really elaborate.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   You know, there's like multiple points he's making.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.460]   And then the reason why I started drawing all these lines is because I couldn't figure
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.300]   out where his trail of thought went, you know, but the main point is really clear.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.860]   God's wisdom is hidden.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.180]   I said God's wisdom is not discoverable by man.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.580]   God's wisdom is only revealed.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.740]   God's wisdom is profound.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.540]   And you can describe the wisdom of God in all these ways.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.260]   Now I want you to go back to verse 13, or sorry, chapter 13 of Matthew.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.260]   Okay.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.460]   So if you're still there, cool, but go back to chapter 13 of Matthew and I'm going to
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.820]   read the whole little section that Jesus says.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.900]   So you know, he says, again, in verse 11 to you, it has been granted to know the mysteries
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:38.340]   of the kingdom of heaven, but to them, it was not granted for whoever has to him, more
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.420]   shall be given and he who will have an abundance, but whoever does not have even what he has
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.060]   shall be taken away from him.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.740]   Therefore, I speak to them in parables because while seeing, they do not see and while hearing,
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.740]   they do not hear, nor do they understand.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.580]   In their case, the prophet says it is fulfilled, which says, you will keep on hearing, but
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.940]   will not understand.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.980]   You will keep on seeing, but will not perceive.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.580]   For the heart of his people has been dull with their ears.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.700]   They are, they scarcely hear and they have closed their eyes.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.220]   Otherwise they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears and understand with their
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.920]   heart and return.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.540]   And I would heal them.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.220]   But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:28.180]   For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desire to see what you see
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:34.900]   and did not see it to hear what you hear and dear and did not hear it.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.580]   I hope we can take a moment to meditate about that a little bit because we're looking at
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:47.100]   a truth where people are being arrogant and they're being rebuked by saying, God has granted
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.860]   this to you, you never discovered it.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.260]   What are you to think about that?
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.620]   How does Jesus talk to the people about this?
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.220]   Basically it's like, you better be grateful.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.780]   You better be humbly grateful.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.700]   You better feel blessed.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:14.740]   As opposed to feeling arrogant and self-confident and doing one of these, I understand.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.300]   You better feel blessed by God.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.180]   Because many men before you wanted to hear this, many men before you wanted to see this
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.580]   and Jesus himself says, but to you it has been granted.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.540]   And that's just grace upon grace upon grace.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.420]   You know?
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.980]   And for us, we need to feel that way.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.420]   In application this is one of those things where we need to have appreciation where for
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:46.300]   those of us who are here looking at the scriptures, you know, having been granted to understand
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.420]   the gospel, we recognize the truth.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.980]   God has in many times through history allowed people to remain in their ignorance.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.100]   God has actually hardened the hearts of men and God has made their heart dull.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.100]   Why?
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.380]   He says so that they could not return.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.780]   So that he would not heal them.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.480]   That's God's prerogative, you know?
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.740]   And so that's how we're to respond to that section.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.100]   So as we think about this, going back to our first Corinthians passage, as we think about
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:25.620]   it, because men cannot obtain to the knowledge of truth on their own, because men cannot
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.860]   attain to the knowledge of God on their own, what does God have to do?
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.820]   Let's get the next section, verse 10 through 13.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.460]   It says, "For to us, God revealed them through the knowledge of truth."
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.740]   Through the spirit.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.700]   And then he starts describing the spirit.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.620]   "For the spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.380]   And he describes the searching.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.860]   "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.060]   in him?
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.260]   Even so, the thoughts of God no one knows except the spirit of God."
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.700]   Okay?
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.500]   And then he goes back to the spirit.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.940]   "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit who is from God, so
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.500]   that they may know the things freely given to us by God.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.980]   These things are the things we speak of, which things we also speak, not in words taught
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.540]   by human wisdom, but in those taught by the spirit, combining spiritual thought with spiritual
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.540]   words."
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.540]   Okay?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.860]   I don't know, does my line thing help you, or does that just confuse you more?
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.940]   I spend a lot of time on these lines, okay?
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.100]   And if you guys have ever tried to do lines on Microsoft Word, nightmare.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.100]   So appreciate these lines, you're blessed, okay?
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   I'm just kidding.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.500]   All right.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.820]   So in thinking through this entire section, you have three concepts that are most repeated
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.160]   in this passage.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.420]   The first obviously is wisdom, but then the second is, especially in verse 10 through
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.340]   13, what's the second term that's repeated?
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.900]   Spirit, okay?
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.960]   It's talking mainly about the role of the spirit.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.060]   It's talking about what the spirit does, okay?
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:17.340]   But then also, another concept that we have to understand, hint hint, is it's repeated
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.020]   many times in kind of synonymous words.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:29.500]   So the concept is repeated in synonymous words.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.500]   Verb, huh?
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   Thought?
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:44.980]   Not the thought, but search.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:51.660]   He says, so search, he extrapolates that and says, "For who among men," what?
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.660]   Sorry?
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.740]   Reveals, not reveals, but knows.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   Okay?
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.260]   So in this whole paragraph, the concept, again, so it's not the exact word that's repeated
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.740]   a bunch, but the concept that's repeated a lot within this entire paragraph, and especially
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.900]   here too, is the concept of understanding, okay?
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.140]   The concept of knowing.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:22.020]   So if you look, like for example, so in verse 10, he talks about how the spirit searches,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.540]   but then as he extrapolates that out, he says in verse 11, "For who among men knows the
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.260]   thoughts of man, the spirit of which," and then he says, "Even so the thoughts of God
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.620]   no one knows," and in verse 12, he says, "So you receive this spirit," not the world, but
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.620]   you receive the spirit of God, and he says, "So that we may," what?
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.820]   Know.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.900]   So actually, he's repeated that concept of know about three to four times already.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:53.460]   And so what you're finding is this, is he's saying, "There's no way you can know," right?
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.700]   That was verse six through nine.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.340]   "There's no way you can discover.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.140]   You're not gonna investigate and find."
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:04.640]   And then he says, "So that you know, what had to happen was God had to reveal.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.980]   He had to reveal through the spirit."
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.980]   Okay?
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.460]   And so, why did I leave that as a blank?
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.940]   But number two, it says, "First thing we learn about the wisdom of God from the second half
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.980]   of the paragraph, natural man cannot discover, so it must be revealed by God through the
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.980]   spirit."
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.980]   Okay?
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   Through the spirit.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.020]   Now, I wanna ask you an important question.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.860]   So in my little diagram of my line, so essentially, what I could've done is just draw a straight
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.860]   line.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.300]   He's talking about the spirit, but there is a side note, right?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   Verse 11.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.940]   It says, "God revealed him through the spirit, for the spirit," and then he says, "You receive
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.260]   the spirit," and so he's essentially talking about the spirit, but then there's a side
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.900]   note, verse 11, "For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.660]   man which is in him?
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.060]   Even so the thoughts of God, no one knows except the spirit of God."
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.060]   Right?
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.620]   My question to you is, how does verse 11 fit into this discussion of wisdom or even the
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.620]   spirit?
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:06.380]   It's like a side note that's just in there, and when I started it, it just confused me
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.020]   like crazy.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.020]   So I had to draw this little thingy.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.380]   How does that fit into his thinking?
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.380]   Yes?
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:30.180]   >> Kind of the idea that no one can know what's really going on in us more than us, so we
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:37.180]   would be the best people to reveal what's going on in our minds and hearts, things like
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.180]   that.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   So, likewise, the spirit of God knows the thoughts of God, therefore the spirit would
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.180]   be the one who can actually reveal it.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.180]   It's not just some outside entity.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.180]   >> Great.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   Absolutely.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.580]   So if you didn't hear him, basically he's saying, God revealed, right, the truth to
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.100]   you, but he did it through the spirit.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:07.260]   But what I want you to understand is, God, God's thoughts, the way God works, the truth
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.220]   that God wants to reveal, the best qualified person is who?
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.820]   The spirit of God.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.660]   Right?
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:21.780]   And so that's what Mitch said, that is basically the best person qualified to speak anything
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.320]   really is you, right?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.260]   Because you know your thoughts.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.660]   You know, roommates, they know each other quite well, they know how dirty they are,
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.820]   they know their bad habits and stuff.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.780]   If you get married, then you know the other person real well, but guess what?
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.380]   There's still hidden things in the heart you don't know.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.100]   But the thought of the man, the spirit of the man knows all the depths of the man.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:48.180]   And so this passage is saying the spirit is most qualified to reveal this to you.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.500]   But in order to make this, I guess, as profound as Apostle Paul thinks of it, because the
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.340]   way he like reveals this, he's almost giving you an argumentation.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.700]   He gives an analogy of the man and the spirit.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.780]   And so he's making kind of an emphatic point.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:09.900]   Think about this, and this is the, again, just the amazing thing about God.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.980]   For us in the New Testament, we should feel absolutely blessed.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.460]   Why?
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.060]   Because to us it was granted to know.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.500]   But not only that, in ages past, God spoke through different medium.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.480]   God spoke through angels, God spoke through dreams, God spoke through miraculous signs
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.880]   and figures of stuff, right?
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:44.140]   How much would he have to care where he does not send an angel with this message, where
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:51.500]   he does not send just a nebulous sign with this message, but he is making sure it goes
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.980]   the way exactly how he desires it by sending his spirit.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.100]   Do you get my point?
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:02.880]   There's a degree of carefulness, there's a degree of attention, there's a degree of,
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.800]   I've got so much invested in this, I'm not gonna make an angel go deliver this message.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.260]   He's gonna send his spirit, the most qualified person, to reveal his truth.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.260]   That's the way I think of it.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.180]   And I think that's the way Apostle Paul is saying, God is designed to reveal, and he
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.680]   revealed it through his spirit, and his spirit is the most qualified, okay?
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:34.780]   Now in thinking about this, we gotta realize that the spirit then reveals in, I guess you
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.500]   can say, different ways, so to speak.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:45.020]   In the next verses of chapter two, let's take a look at the next part here in verse 13.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:53.140]   In verse 13 he says, "So you've not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit who
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.580]   is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God."
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.500]   Verse 13, "Which things we also speak, not in the words taught by human wisdom, but in
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.380]   those taught by the spirit, combining spiritual thought with spiritual words."
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.260]   Okay, so, for those of you guys who are members, you guys better get this answered quickly,
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.460]   'cause it was on your quiz.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.380]   What is the biblical doctrine that teaches that the Bible has its source in God?
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.380]   Thank you!
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:24.220]   It's like, "Oh no!"
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.340]   Inspiration, okay, inspiration is the blank there.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.180]   That we covered in BCC class.
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:36.260]   This is to say, this is another passage that teaches us that the Bible has its source in
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.260]   God.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.260]   Why?
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.980]   Because it says, "These are words not taught by human wisdom."
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.940]   This isn't like, you know, words of wise men and sages, experienced pastors just giving
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.220]   you ministry experience and life wisdom.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.620]   No, these are words given by the spirit.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   Okay?
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:57.940]   And so, something I want to let you guys kind of, again, review with you is, there is in
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:03.380]   the theological world what's called plenary verbal inspiration.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.860]   I personally think they can just do away with that, you know, like high-wording plenary
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   verbal inspiration.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.620]   But what that really just means is, the idea is that the verbal aspect of it is simply
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.620]   every single word.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.860]   Okay?
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.580]   I believe that in the original manuscript, every single word that's in there is inspired.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.660]   And that's why we study stuff like grammar.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.140]   That's why we study stuff like, you know, doing the prospects of Jesus.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:35.700]   And we're able to deduce, "Hey, because this word is in the present ongoing way, that's
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.180]   what He expects of you."
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.580]   If I didn't believe that every word was inspired by God, guess what?
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.340]   All I'm really doing is reading way too in the lines.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.300]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.380]   Because the biblical doctrine is that every word has its place, because it's from the
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.140]   Spirit, we preach in the way that we do.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:59.700]   What's more, the plenary sense is essentially saying all of the Bible.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:06.340]   When you say somebody has the plenary authority, that means all authority, unlimited authority.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.300]   Basically in every aspect of the Bible, whether geography, whether genealogy, whether historicity,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.180]   whether scientific, some of the stuff that a lot of the liberal people in our day and
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.580]   age have said, "Dude, the Bible is an ancient text.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.860]   How is it going to get that right?"
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.700]   And they've completely denied its authenticity or even accuracy.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:32.060]   We believe that every aspect of the Bible in every single page is the inspired Word
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.420]   of God.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.420]   And so, the other part is Holy Scripture.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.100]   And I just put a bunch of blanks there because it would have been lame to have a blank, for
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.820]   inspiration and then to have the answer there.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:55.220]   So anyway, so the whole idea is plenary verbal inspiration is saying every word, every page,
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.100]   all inspired.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.740]   Any questions about that?
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.460]   There's a passage that is really good for you to know.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.860]   If somebody asks you, "Why do you put so much?
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.380]   Why do you put so much weight?
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.460]   Why do you put so much importance and why do you give so much authority to the Bible?"
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:21.300]   It's because the Scripture says very clearly that these are the words of God.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.740]   First Peter chapter one, verse 19 through 21, it says here, "So we have the prophetic
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.660]   word made more sure to which you do well to pay attention as a lamp shining in a dark
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.380]   place until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:42.420]   But know this first of all," okay, know this as like something super crucial, "that no
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.460]   prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.940]   For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.980]   spoke from God."
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:01.020]   So this passage in 1 Corinthians that we're studying, this is a passage that proves to
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.940]   us, a lot of people ask, "You know, Apostle Paul, I don't think he understood that he
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.100]   was giving the word of God."
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.140]   No, I think he clearly understood he was giving the word of God.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.140]   Why?
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:19.540]   Because he says very clearly, "We speak these things that the Spirit has given to us."
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:27.140]   So this passage really goes to prove and show us that the inspiration of Scripture is true.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.420]   Any questions about that?
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:38.460]   All right, then in the next section, he goes on to give us a contrast between a natural
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.380]   man and a spiritual man.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.820]   And in so doing, he shows us another way in which the Holy Spirit gives us the wisdom
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.820]   of God.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.820]   All right?
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:53.020]   Verse 14, "But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:59.380]   are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised."
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:05.820]   "But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.540]   For who has known the mind of the Lord that he will instruct him?
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.860]   But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.060]   Okay?
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:22.340]   So if you look on your packet, what I've done is, because in the passage, he sets up a contrast.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:28.300]   He says, "But the natural man," and then in verse 14, "But he who is spiritual."
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.220]   And if you guys look at how I kind of put those in the column, you guys can see the
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.860]   contrast, right?
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.140]   He says, "The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit, for they are foolishness
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.980]   to him, he cannot understand.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.900]   On the flip side, he who is a spiritual man appraises all things," and then at the very
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.740]   end, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   Okay?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.140]   One cannot understand, the other has been granted the mind of Christ.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   Okay?
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.180]   So, I asked this question.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:07.780]   Although we believe that the Bible is powerful, why is it that many people can read the Bible,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.100]   maybe even a lot, but yet don't understand?
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.380]   This is a question for you guys.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.940]   There's sometimes, you know, people who are against Christianity, or people who've been
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:27.100]   jaded by Christianity, will sometimes ask questions similar to this.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.260]   Why is it that you got a Bible, but like the vast majority of your entire faith is disagreeing
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.260]   with each other?
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:42.100]   Like, you know, why is it that you've had this Bible for so long, but you guys are still
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.220]   trying to interpret it?
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.700]   You guys have never received those questions?
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.740]   I'm pretty sure you have, you know?
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.740]   Like, why?
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   What gives?
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.260]   You know, you've got all this Bible professors, and you've got all this stuff, but there's
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.660]   a whole lot of people who don't understand.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.260]   How about you guys try to answer that question?
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.460]   Give me, you know, whatever thoughts you guys have.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.380]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.300]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.220]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.140]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.060]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.980]   (insects chirping)
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.940]   - Okay, how about let's have somebody
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.140]   from Mark Ballas' table.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.400]   Any one of you guys wanna try just,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.340]   again, I know some of it, some of it you guys
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.280]   can just answer from other things you've read.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.220]   Or, you know, we're talking about it today,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.740]   or we're looking at the past,
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.840]   and it's like there's a natural man
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.540]   and there's a spiritual man.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.540]   What's an answer you can give to somebody who says,
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.420]   you know, we've had the Bible literally for like 2,000 years.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.180]   Why are we still in so much confusion?
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.600]   How come we don't understand?
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:29.040]   - We're talking about like,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.960]   most Christians, like,
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.020]   - So, maybe just work at it from the hypothetical scenario
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.940]   that one of your non-believing friends asks you.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.860]   Here's the Bible, you've had it for a whole long,
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.360]   there's a lot of disagreement, what gives?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.340]   (coughing)
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:58.720]   - So, you guys hear him, he says,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.540]   because you need faith to understand it,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.040]   you have to have belief to know what it's saying.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.340]   What else can you say?
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.060]   What other answers are there?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:10.900]   Yes.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.840]   Sorry, I took a hear.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.500]   Okay, maybe God has not revealed it to them.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.340]   Okay.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.300]   Hmm.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.140]   So, okay.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.940]   I can potentially see the guy coming back at you
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.300]   and be like, well, that sucks.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.780]   (laughing)
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.760]   You're telling me to read this thing
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.060]   and God's not gonna reveal it to you.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.000]   But anyway, but, from what we're reading right now,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.440]   Paul going on so that you need to probably
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.860]   give more inclination to.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.700]   Okay.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.780]   (typing)
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.360]   - I have a question.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.200]   - Yes.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.060]   Speak up a little bit.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.380]   I've got the computer going,
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.120]   my old computer fan is like, hmm.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.960]   - Sir.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.940]   I just have a question, like,
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.100]   as a Christian, how come the Spirit reveals all the time?
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.880]   I guess what makes sense, but,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.800]   how come you don't know everything?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.840]   The Spirit is truly on,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.040]   just because the Sister of Peter is saying that.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.880]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.040]   - So, it's in the reading.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.000]   People are understanding,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   let's say, the Sister of Peter is murder,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.160]   or I'll read the parables,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.520]   and each year it sounds different.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.800]   Like, I'm learning.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.640]   - Yeah.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.400]   - So, my question is,
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.020]   how come you don't understand that,
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.940]   that's the one question I just want to ask you.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.060]   What are your thoughts?
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.280]   - Okay, so you guys hear this question,
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.700]   it's like, so, why is it that sometimes
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.620]   we don't know in full, basically?
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.620]   We read the Bible, and then we have to read the passes
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.860]   multiple times, and then you're like
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.660]   constantly figuring out stuff.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.260]   If the Spirit is revealing stuff to us,
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.600]   why don't we just know, you know?
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.300]   And there's multiple ways to think about that a little bit.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.700]   And the reason why I'm asking this question is 'cause,
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.940]   two part, one, is because I feel that
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.300]   in the Christian community,
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.800]   there is a fear of telling people straight up,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.720]   you know, yeah, you can't know,
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.520]   you don't understand,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   because your spiritual intellect is dead, right?
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.840]   Like, that's a spiritual reality we have to teach people.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.420]   Sometimes we fear telling people that,
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.640]   but that's a spiritual reality.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.840]   The second part we have to understand is
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.160]   there is confusion between the Spirit's role of revelation,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.540]   inspiration, and illumination, okay?
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.620]   So, to answer your question in brief,
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.060]   is between a non-Christian and Christian,
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.980]   obviously, the Spirit has to do his regenerative
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.680]   and illuminating work in our heart,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.920]   open our eyes, and then to understand.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.700]   Otherwise, we won't.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.980]   But secondly, two parts.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.500]   One, people sometimes mistake, say,
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.060]   God's gonna just like reveal stuff to me.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.300]   Well, I believe you can't be too, like,
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.020]   too wide-stroke to be like, because the Spirit reveals,
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.000]   he's gonna just reveal stuff to me.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.580]   God did that definitely with the apostles.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.120]   When Apostle Paul is saying here, saying,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.380]   we speak and God has revealed,
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.360]   I actually believe he's not saying every single Christian,
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.580]   we all speak and we all have been revealed to.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.040]   I think he's actually specifically speaking to the fact
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.660]   that yes, God has moved in them to pen the scriptures, right?
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.840]   But secondly, God has never removed us
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.800]   from the process of knowing him.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.500]   He calls us to search.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.100]   He calls us to hunger and thirst for him.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.800]   He calls us to look deeply and to dig his word,
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.880]   and he calls us to keep looking, you know what I'm saying?
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.860]   God has never removed us from the process of knowing him
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.220]   and experiencing him through the word.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.000]   So, those are some things to keep in mind about.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.680]   Of course I've wished, like,
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.260]   just, you know, jump drive it in, God,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.800]   like, help me understand, you know?
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.000]   Do the file transfer and just let me know.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.900]   And I'm pretty sure that in life situations,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.160]   you've wondered, like, God, it'd be really, really nice
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.700]   if you would just reveal to me exactly what I should do.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.160]   But God has, again, called us to be a part
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.100]   of that experience of knowing and determining
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.780]   and discerning his will, okay?
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.360]   But in thinking about this,
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.860]   we wanna emphasize that point.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.700]   You know, I ask, like,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.040]   why is it that people don't understand?
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.060]   Well, the fact of the matter is,
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.140]   one, we do need to train.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.120]   We need to exercise the capacity
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.880]   to divide the word of God, right?
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.720]   I mean, there's a sense in which,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.740]   not thinking through, like, you know,
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.760]   all that the Bible has to say,
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.700]   but practically and legitimately speaking,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.880]   think about the people who have gone before us,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.580]   who are saints before us, who have devoted their lives
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.200]   to say, for me to understand the wisdom of God
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.820]   and the will of God, what I'm going to do
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.980]   is literally devote myself
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.320]   to understanding the word of the Lord.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.280]   And so you have people who've devoted
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.700]   so much time and energy, typically speaking,
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.460]   typically speaking, that ends up bearing a lot of fruit,
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.960]   because that's how the Spirit works, through his word.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.680]   Now, the fact of the matter, though,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.360]   is that in of itself going to provide
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.200]   the spiritual wisdom?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.740]   Absolutely not.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.660]   The Pharisees, prime example.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.700]   If you look at the traditions of the Pharisees,
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.280]   it's actually quite impressive.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.500]   By a certain age, they were already memorizing
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.200]   so much of scripture.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.740]   They're called scribes and Pharisees for a reason.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.460]   They're the leaders for a reason.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.740]   They weren't dumb people, you know,
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.600]   to kind of say it frankly.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.280]   They were impressive in their habitual discipline, you know?
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.660]   They understood so much of the scriptures,
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.240]   but the fact of the matter is,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.540]   they missed the main point.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.620]   And in this passage that we're studying, it says,
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.260]   they obviously did not understand,
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.040]   otherwise they would not have crucified, right?
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.680]   They would not have crucified the Lord Jesus.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.280]   They did not understand.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.820]   They missed the right picture of the Messiah.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.460]   Rather, they ended up hating him.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.440]   And what's really interesting is, in verse 15,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.960]   it says, in a kind of unique way,
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.360]   that they're gonna end up hating you too.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.660]   But he who is spiritual appraises all things,
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.100]   yet he himself is appraised by no one.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.000]   You, as a Christian, as a spiritual individual,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.760]   exercising spiritual appraisal,
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.360]   spiritual judgment and discernment of the world,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.520]   you are going to be appraised by no one,
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.960]   in a sense that you're not gonna be
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.180]   respected, valued by anybody.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.400]   Everybody's gonna think you're weird.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.600]   Everybody's gonna think you're off.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.500]   Everybody's gonna think, like,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.060]   you're all messed up in the head, you know?
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.800]   That's kind of like what we expect as Christians.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.240]   But my whole point in all this is the whole idea of,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.620]   without the Spirit of God,
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.680]   without the Holy Spirit in us, moving through us,
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.440]   without the exercise of discipline
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.520]   and the Holy Spirit combining his work to us,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.780]   we are not going to discern.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.280]   We're not going to understand.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.400]   And so we have the biblical doctrine that teaches us
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.560]   we need the Spirit to help us,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.580]   to understand and discern appropriately,
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.820]   and that is, I think I said it earlier,
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.600]   the doctrine that we need the Holy Spirit
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.140]   to understand the Bible is,
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.800]   (pages turning)
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.420]   illumination, okay?
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.480]   Illumination.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:45:01.360]   And so I want us to think about this
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.680]   in a kind of wrapping up here.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.520]   The illumination is required.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.880]   And I wanna kind of end the point by saying this.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   To me, a humble man is a man who has a good grasp on reality.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:26.160]   On the flip side, a prideful man, he what?
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.480]   He always thinks more than he really is.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.640]   He speaks more than he really knows.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.040]   He throws himself.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.680]   He, you know, kind of wears it big.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.520]   But the humble man knows reality, okay?
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.560]   Well, if you look at verse 16, there's a rhetorical question.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.080]   It says, "For who has known the mind of the Lord
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.920]   "that he will instruct him?"
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.320]   Okay?
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.360]   I write in your conclusion,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.820]   a prideful man thinks he knows a lot.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.240]   A prideful man likes to talk a lot.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.960]   He likes to show people how much he knows.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.920]   A prideful man thinks he can figure it out.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.520]   A prideful man would actually prefer
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.880]   to solve things on his own.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   The humble individual will ask of the Lord,
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.920]   "God, open my eyes."
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.040]   Okay?
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.320]   King David says in Psalm 119,
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.880]   "Open my eyes that I may behold
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.440]   "wonderful things from your law."
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.100]   A humble person who recognizes reality
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.160]   will realize he actually understands very little.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.040]   As a matter of fact, when it comes to discovering things,
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.200]   as a matter of fact, when it comes to figuring things out
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.800]   on his own, it is nearly, almost impossible.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.760]   I say nearly, almost, because the only hope
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.200]   of understanding is what?
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.680]   Asking.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.880]   God, instruct me.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:47.640]   I can only understand what you give to me freely
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.400]   and I receive it.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.640]   The humble man knows his position,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.320]   that God is his instructor,
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.080]   and he dare not in his arrogance try to instruct God.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.120]   All right?
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.640]   Verse 16, that's what it says.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.280]   Who knows the mind of the Lord that he will instruct him?
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.320]   But arrogant people, they always know what's best.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   They will always try to teach others,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.080]   and in turn, God, what's right.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.360]   In line with what we've been learning so far
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.440]   about division and pride,
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.120]   I think this is probably one of these heavy-hitting notes
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.760]   of do you recognize where you are?
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.480]   Do you understand how understanding
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   and knowledge actually works?
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.360]   You don't know.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.200]   What you have is only given by the grace of God.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.560]   He's given it to you freely,
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.400]   and your attitude should be that of thank you.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.320]   Thank you for opening up your truth to me.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.160]   Thank you for giving me light of the word
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.900]   rather than pride having absolute humility.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.600]   All right, any questions about the passage
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.640]   or things that you guys noticed?
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   Yes, Eugene.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.360]   Can you move your hand from your, yeah.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   I'm having such a hard time.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.460]   Okay, sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:14.960]   Okay.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:23.840]   Right.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.180]   (audience member speaking off mic)
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:38.000]   Okay.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.680]   All right, good question is how do you respond
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.600]   to when you're evangelizing?
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.960]   How does this affect your evangelism and stuff like that?
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.640]   I remember Eric asked a really good question
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.840]   about apologetics and stuff like that, that's roll,
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.800]   and I remember last week saying,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.480]   the Bible is solid, it's sufficient.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.080]   Believe me, I actually taught a class on evangelism,
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.280]   and I actually really enjoy apologetics.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.840]   I've read a lot of books on it.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.720]   So there is a place for reasoning with people,
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.560]   and there is a place for practicing
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.600]   the kind of like winsome and also winning of the argument,
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.840]   so to speak, with people.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.080]   But a couple things.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.560]   And you guys can maybe talk about this
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.080]   in your small groups and discussion groups,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.360]   but how does this kind of affect
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.760]   the way that you evangelize?
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.120]   Great question.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.200]   Well, a couple things.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   One of the things that I find is this is
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.960]   somebody says like, okay, so I'm kind of a newbie
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.520]   at evangelism, I've got some verses memorized,
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.880]   I've got my Bible, I'm gonna go share with people.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.960]   Here it is, ta-da, and the person's like,
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   wah-bam, you know, shuts the door on their face,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.680]   and they go, boo-hoo.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.480]   The thing about it is, most people,
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.840]   the way they respond is, so it doesn't work.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.640]   We need da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.200]   My response is no, like, don't think that.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.120]   It's not that it didn't work.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.760]   You just can't conclude now we need a new method.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.200]   So that's my first application.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   Second application is, what really is required is
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.240]   we have to be like really, really prayerful.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.360]   We have to literally rely on the Lord and say,
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.600]   okay, I'm gonna say something now,
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.400]   and unless your spirit works,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.480]   it's not gonna happen at all, okay?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.120]   And I tell people all the time,
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.440]   so in my mind, again, there's a balance.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.560]   I believe in apologetics,
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.800]   and I believe in winning arguments.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.200]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.600]   certain people get saved when they see a little piece
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.240]   of paper with four truths on it,
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.840]   and they're like, oh my God, you know?
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   So there's a balance in assessing what's working,
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.920]   what's effective, just based on what you experienced.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.080]   You can't do that.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.560]   We have to realize this passage is telling us
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.360]   that God is, again, opening the hearts of men,
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.400]   and there's inspiration of scripture,
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.580]   and he illuminates the word to the people to understand.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.920]   So for me, I actually believe in casting the net
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.640]   wide and far, so I tried different types of methodologies.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.360]   I like this whole personal approach
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.360]   where you get to know them,
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.880]   and you start asking about their lives,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.240]   and oh, they care so much about their kids,
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.560]   and you're like, what do you hope for your kids?
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.160]   And then you start jumping in there and saying,
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.240]   don't you wish that your kids were spiritually well too?
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.640]   And then you get into that conversation.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.440]   I actually am a fan of the open air preaching.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.520]   I'm a fan of what I like to call
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.080]   divine appointment evangelism.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.000]   It's basically cold turkey evangelism.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   You go out and just meet people.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.360]   I'm a fan of all of that.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.180]   Why?
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.560]   Because you just cast the net wide and far.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.640]   You just get the truth out,
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.000]   and then you just trust
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.840]   that the Holy Spirit is going to work.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.560]   For me, that's the kind of application I have
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.620]   of that kind of stuff.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.280]   I'm not sure if I'm really answering your question.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.880]   I hope that helped a little bit.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:52:00.160]   Okay.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:09.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.460]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.780]   You know, so did you guys hear his question?
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.900]   I don't want to just spend a couple of minutes,
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.140]   and then we'll just kind of move on,
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.380]   but there's a guy, he's stuck on the fact,
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.620]   I don't think Bible's reliable.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   I can't believe it.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.560]   Then before getting on a long trail,
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.340]   I'll ask him, so if there is clear evidence
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.260]   that the Bible's reliable,
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.860]   will you give it a legitimate shot,
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.500]   or are you determined to not believe it?
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.100]   'Cause I have to deal with that with him.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.360]   And if he says, no, yeah, I mean,
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.080]   if there is reasonable evidence that it's reliable,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.500]   then I would.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.520]   It's 'cause for me, I completely believe
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.700]   that the Bible is textually reliable,
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.160]   and there's so much evidence we can just spend
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.320]   probably like a 10-week series apologetically
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.280]   on why the Bible is reliable, right?
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.180]   But it's a whole other story when you say
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.940]   the Bible is authoritative and demands your faith, right?
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.180]   That's kind of like that subjective experience
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.480]   he needs to have.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.320]   So I would push him on that.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.800]   So I do the research about, okay,
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.040]   there's some sufficient articles here,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.860]   there's manuscripts, there's early documentation.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.040]   Compared to any other historical document,
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.020]   this is probably the most well-documented thing
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.600]   in the universe.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.440]   The copies are consistent.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.320]   They have libraries where they have ancient manuscripts.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.160]   The earliest manuscripts are not 400 or 500 years out.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.920]   Some of them are early as only less than 100 years out,
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.120]   you know, which is better than any other documents
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.280]   that we have that's considered ancient.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.080]   And you go through all these argumentation,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.880]   but then the fact of the matter is you gotta just say,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.640]   see, so your prejudice was wrong.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.200]   Now can we really give a shot as to
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.000]   the scripture says you're a sinner.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.800]   Do you understand what that's saying, you know?
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.920]   And I have to get back to that.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.280]   So I'm not gonna spend all my time trying to prove to him,
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.800]   see, the Bible's reliable, you dummy, you know?
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.040]   'Cause at that point, that's all I've done.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.960]   I need to get to the point of there's a moral decision
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.840]   to be made about the gospel, yeah.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.520]   All right.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.040]   All right, any other questions?
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.720]   Oh, sorry, go here and then there, yes?
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.080]   I don't know, but go ahead and then.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.760]   - So illumination, the last appreciation,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.280]   the true believers have the Holy Spirit
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.880]   to help us understand the scripture.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.920]   - True.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.640]   - I did miss the 1 Corinthians 1, 10,
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.920]   or, you know, number two in session two.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.080]   But this has always got to be that
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.360]   we're supposed to all agree and have no division.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.560]   So let's say you and me,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.800]   we both say we have illumination by the Holy Spirit.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.760]   Why is it that strong Christian men like you,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.200]   Parker, don't believe in Jesus,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.240]   and bring fire and chaos,
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.320]   whereas you are like, or C.J. Mahaney,
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.400]   and you strongly agree,
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.480]   and because of that, we can't be at the same church,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.960]   or, you know, we can't be together,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.600]   or other stuff like covenant-verse dispensation,
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.280]   or churches splitting.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.520]   It's wrong because my Mormon co-workers
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.560]   are next to me,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.360]   and their advantage is that their prophet,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.840]   or whatever system they have,
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   tells it as it is.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.960]   This is what we believe, this is what we know.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   - Right.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.840]   - That all these Christians,
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.480]   that the Holy Spirit,
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.360]   have a different illumination.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.560]   - Yeah, so it's not necessarily
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.080]   that there are different illuminations, you know.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.680]   The way I like to put it is,
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.840]   well, the fact of the matter is,
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.680]   there is what is a difference of saying
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.960]   God has sufficiently revealed something,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.320]   as opposed to God has exhaustively revealed something.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.600]   And so the fact of the matter is,
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.160]   there are certain things that God will say,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.440]   and so in the end times,
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.920]   there is this dragon who's Satan,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.520]   there is this beast,
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.760]   and there's this prophet.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.400]   Like, whoa, that was a lot
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   in just a couple sentences, right?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.240]   So he has sufficiently revealed to you
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.800]   that something's gonna happen,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.760]   but he did not exhaustively reveal to you
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.800]   what that's gonna look like,
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.640]   when it's gonna be,
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.960]   how that's gonna affect us,
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.200]   you know, what kind of effects will it have
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.720]   on the social, economic, religious atmosphere of the world.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.920]   He did not exhaustively reveal everything.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.120]   But what do we tend to do
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.800]   as we try to interpret the scriptures?
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.720]   We're trying to, to the greatest degree we can,
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.080]   understand something.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.120]   So in that room, there is room for disagreement.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.760]   And no Christian's gonna look at each other
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.960]   and be like, and so because I disagree with you,
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.880]   we have two different,
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.320]   completely different illuminations,
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.080]   or the fact that we have two different faiths,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.040]   or anything like that.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.360]   We call those just simply in-house debates.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.720]   I believe MacArthur's a brother,
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.080]   I believe C.J. Mahaney is a brother,
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.560]   we all agree on the same core essential doctrines
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.440]   that cause us to be saved,
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.000]   but we have other parts of revelation
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.480]   that God has, again, sufficiently revealed,
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.640]   but not exhaustively,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.880]   and so we have questions.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.000]   Does that help at all?
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.600]   (laughs)
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   And the fact of the matter is, I mean,
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.200]   like, again, the Mormons have that, like,
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.760]   you know, accusation, so to speak, on us and whatnot.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.080]   And, you know, to the,
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.280]   'cause to me, the Mormon mind is a pagan mind.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.520]   They're looking at us,
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.640]   and they're looking at us like fools.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.440]   We're looking at this and saying, like,
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.200]   this is my authority that God has given me,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.880]   and no man stands above this.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.960]   God has said, and that, you know,
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.280]   this is what I submit to, right?
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.560]   And the Mormon is sitting there saying,
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.400]   he has said, and I submit to him.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.120]   He has no right to accuse us of being stupid,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.540]   or that it's being false.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:54.000]   He's, they're looking at this, you know what I'm saying?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.880]   So, religion to everybody who's a pagan
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.800]   is gonna look foolish,
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.360]   because they're just looking at one source and saying,
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.680]   well, there's my authority.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   But a Mormon has no greater, like,
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.800]   like intellectual or even moral grounds to say,
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.560]   oh, therefore Christianity is less right,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.040]   or less, you know what I'm saying?
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.840]   Yeah, so I hope that helps a little bit.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.240]   Last question, and then you guys can jump
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.680]   into your guys' small group.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:16.360]   - I guess it's, I mean, I touched upon it,
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.280]   but I guess my question is, like,
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.680]   obviously God reveals something in the parts that he's not,
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.720]   but sometimes the scripture, like, I wonder, like, why,
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.520]   so for example, there's, like, instances,
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.320]   I think it's in, like, Samuel and Luke,
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   where they talk about the same event,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.280]   but, like, the numbering is different,
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.480]   and then I, like, Googled things,
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.760]   and they said, like, oh, it's because, like,
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.400]   they think he's a woman, or whatever,
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.600]   but my question is, like, why does,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.400]   in my mind, like, why does God allow that
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.200]   in the scene to be the happy,
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.560]   rather than the happy in the scene,
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.880]   so you don't see the pain?
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.720]   - Yeah.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.320]   - 'Cause it kind of, I mean, I understand, like,
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.480]   it's the same event,
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.240]   but it's different ways,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.520]   and I don't think you can see it as a shared.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.360]   - Yeah.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.880]   - So don't doubt.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.240]   - Yeah, so to tell you honestly,
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.560]   did you guys all hear her question?
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.560]   Good.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:09.120]   So to tell you honestly, it goes both ways.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.040]   So if somebody's looking at the difference
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.520]   of two accounts and saying,
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   ah, that causes me to cast a shadow of doubt,
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.720]   another person looks at that and says,
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.920]   hey, that tells me that it actually happened,
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.320]   because it's personal testimonies from two individuals
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.080]   about the same events, okay?
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.760]   So if you were to go in a court of law,
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.800]   and you talk to lawyers,
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.400]   and Lee Strobel did this with his whole case for thing,
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.440]   whatever, and he makes this case that
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.240]   if you were to take the witnesses of scripture
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.960]   and go to a courtroom, to a judge,
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.840]   and to a lawyer, experienced courtroom lawyer,
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   and say, take these witness accounts,
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.520]   'cause that's what it is, when you see stories, okay?
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.760]   Some of the Bible is poetic,
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.200]   some of the Bible is allegorical,
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.160]   some of the Bible is didactic teaching.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.840]   A huge chunk of it is personal testimony witness stuff,
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.160]   like this is my account of what happened.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.440]   You take that to lawyers and say,
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.280]   do these things, would it hold up in the court of law
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:08.720]   as valid testimonies, and they said, absolutely, right?
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.800]   So it goes both ways on that.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.560]   I think also, for me, it just makes sense too.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.320]   So the prime example I use all the time
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   is the whole Jesus, you know, is resurrection thing.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.160]   So they make this case like, in the Gospel of John,
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.240]   in the Gospel of Matthew,
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.440]   the number of angels they see is different.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.360]   One says one angel, and the other says two angels, right?
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.040]   But the fact of the matter is,
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.160]   God spoke this revelation to us
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.880]   and carried it down to us through people,
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.000]   and we have a way of speaking.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.320]   It's our common lingo.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.680]   So I use this case example.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.320]   If you were at a basketball game,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.640]   at the NBA, you're watching the Lakers,
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.880]   and nowadays, all these guys have long hair sometimes,
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.720]   but then they're like, wait a minute, that's a girl, right?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.440]   Now, one guy says, that's a girl,
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.720]   and the guy next to him is like, oh my God, you're right.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.600]   Wait a minute, there's two.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   Are they in disagreement with each other?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.800]   No.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.400]   If you see something miraculous,
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.920]   it's completely legitimate for you to say,
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.680]   hey, that's a girl, there's a girl on the court.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   He didn't lie, he wasn't inaccurate,
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.880]   he wasn't just as precise as we would like him to be.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.800]   And sometimes, people approach the Bible like that
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.720]   as a, I don't know, accountant or something.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.960]   It's like, okay, you weren't very accurate in there,
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.200]   so it's not reliable.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.640]   No, that's a way of speaking in various contexts of life.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.480]   And so one guy says, there's two.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.520]   When you experience something
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.760]   that's completely out of the norm,
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.800]   like seeing an angel over an empty tomb
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.240]   of the crucified Messiah,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.880]   it's legitimate for them to be shocked
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.800]   and say something like, there's an angel.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.240]   There's two angels, okay?
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.160]   For the cases of the Old Testament and numbers,
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.040]   you have to also realize there's limitations
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.480]   to the Hebrew numbering system.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.280]   So look into that a little bit.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.220]   I personally believe you do your homework
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.880]   on any passage that people say there's a discrepancy,
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.680]   good explanation why.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.240]   And in the end, the people who try to see
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.780]   whether this is a good testimony or not,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.240]   I think they'll notice this is a genuine,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.920]   personal testimony of what really happened, okay?
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.440]   All right.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.640]   I hope that was good review for like,
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.960]   yeah, the Bible's reliable.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.280]   The Bible is from the Spirit of God.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.820]   Again, for all of us,
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.600]   we're at a Bible teaching church,
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   and is it a possibility we take for granted
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.320]   how available the Bible is to us?
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.160]   Absolutely.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.280]   You know?
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.040]   Let's be super thankful that we are allowed,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.360]   again, we are allowed to receive the Word of God
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.040]   so freely as we are, okay?
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:51.880]   Let's pray.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.840]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.520]   God, we thank you for, again,
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.880]   God, this world is a dark world.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.560]   Our hearts was a dark place.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.160]   We thank you, Lord, that you shined
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.840]   the light of your truth, the light of your Son.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.920]   And I pray, Father Lord, that we would be humble people
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.560]   that doesn't think that we need just some of it
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.920]   and the rest we can figure out,
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.880]   or that doesn't think that we absolutely
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.380]   are dependent on the Spirit, even to understand.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.720]   Some of us, we have a hard time just disciplining ourselves
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.520]   to open up the Bible and read.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.920]   But then not only do we need to get past that foundation,
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.080]   but we need to understand.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.760]   And I pray, Lord, that you'd grant to us
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.320]   strength for both.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.960]   I pray, Father God, that our hearts would be submitted.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.600]   I pray, Lord, that our hearts would be truly devoted
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.640]   to applying your word into our lives.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.440]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
