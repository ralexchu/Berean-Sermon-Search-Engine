[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.820]   the questions together.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.100]   But I do hope that in your own time,
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.720]   you guys are able to really dive into those questions,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.620]   'cause I'm trying to use those questions now
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740]   as also like major,
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.460]   setups for the major points that we are studying, okay?
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.560]   And to tell you honestly,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.340]   sometimes coming up with these questions are pretty hard.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.980]   Coming up with discussion questions is like extra difficult.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.340]   If you guys have, like,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.280]   as you're doing your own observation and stuff,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.460]   email me through the week, like,
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.200]   "Hey, this seems really interesting
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.660]   "and hard to decide how to interpret."
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.060]   All your observations and questions,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.140]   you can shoot me emails,
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.980]   and then I'll be sure to bring them up too in the study,
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.140]   okay?
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.060]   So again, for next week,
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.580]   if you guys are studying the passage,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.600]   please email me, okay?
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.820]   Well, let's take a road
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.280]   of just kind of reviewing what's been happening
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.420]   by looking at the flow of thought, okay?
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.100]   So I'm not gonna say, "Oh, first is this,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.380]   "then this is exactly this,"
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.980]   but looking more so at the flow of thought
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.980]   that's been happening with Apostle Paul
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.900]   writing this letter to the Corinthians.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.420]   So these are all kind, some of them are really obvious,
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.740]   so I want you guys to just yell it out, okay?
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.940]   In the first section, as he opens this letter,
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.660]   he thanks God that they are.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.060]   I saw all of you guys go over to write,
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.460]   but what did you guys write?
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300]   He thanks God that they are?
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.460]   Saints, yeah, that they're saints and they're saved, okay?
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.300]   And then, in the next section,
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.540]   he quickly goes into, "But," this is what I hear,
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.740]   he hears that there are?
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.540]   Divisions among you, all right?
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.820]   Divisions among you.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.900]   And he believes that these divisions exist
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.500]   because there is worldly,
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500]   what was that?
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.280]   Worldly wisdom, okay?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.300]   They have this worldly wisdom that's divisive,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.840]   and typically, I mentioned that the worldly wisdom,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.240]   typically, think about all the advice you get
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.040]   when you're young about how to date,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.320]   what career to pick, and how to choose this path
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.000]   and that path, and it's all about becoming greater.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   There's a sense of pride, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.900]   And I showed you that the topic of arrogance and pride
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.520]   came up in almost every chapter, right?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.680]   And we just listed those off.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.720]   And number four, Apostle Paul counteracts that
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.160]   by saying God's wisdom is superior.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.680]   So what you have is him explaining to you,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.240]   this is the difference between the world's wisdom
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.860]   and God's wisdom, and God's wisdom is permanent.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880]   God's wisdom is powerful, okay?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.760]   And then, he not only talks about God's wisdom in general,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.560]   but he points to the people and says,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.480]   think about your humble,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.680]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.880]   close, beginning, or calling, okay?
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   So that goes hand in hand.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.480]   When you were called, what was your life circumstance, right?
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.080]   So you can say, think about your humble calling.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.720]   And I made mention of this fact,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.400]   Apostle Paul's kind of getting personal.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.520]   He's like, so there's these divisions, huh?
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.280]   You guys are sitting there trying to one-up each other.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.360]   You guys are saying, I'm of Apollos, and I'm of Paul.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   Some of you are saying, I'm just of Jesus only,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.160]   'cause I don't need any of you guys and all this stuff.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.560]   And they have this arrogance, and he says,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   personally, think about yourself, right?
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560]   Now, in so doing, Apostle Paul showed us
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.360]   that God functions upon completely different standards
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   than the world.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.440]   The world functions on stuff like strength,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880]   stature, birth order, nobility.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.800]   And God, he says, his standards are,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.880]   his wise standards come from things of righteousness,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.240]   holiness, and redemption, right?
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.600]   In this last, or in this next section
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   that we're gonna study today,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   he's still on this whole train of thought,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.320]   and that's why we have to review.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.280]   He's still in the train of thought,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.360]   and in still talking about it, he says,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   okay, think about you, but now also think about my preaching.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.400]   Okay?
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.960]   Think about my preaching to you.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.220]   Like, how and what did I teach you when I preached to you?
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.420]   Okay?
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.660]   And this is the section that we're studying
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.180]   in verses one through five of chapter two,
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.740]   preaching God's wisdom, okay?
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.140]   And I wrote a little mark.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.060]   I know, sorry, I had you guys study verses all up until 12,
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.540]   but lo and behold, we can only,
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.380]   I think we can only cover the first five verses.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.500]   All right.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.300]   So let's begin here by reading this section in verse two.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.180]   I'm gonna read the whole section,
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.700]   a paragraph, verses one through five.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.780]   And when I came to you, brethren,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.180]   I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom,
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.780]   proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.860]   For I determined to know nothing among you
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.800]   except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.100]   I was with you in weakness and in fear
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.940]   and in much trembling, and my message and my preaching
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.800]   were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.820]   but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.940]   so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men,
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.420]   but on the power of God.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.500]   Okay?
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.340]   All right.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.180]   In this section, we wanna begin with verse one.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180]   And he essentially, you know, as typically
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.780]   when you write an essay, the first sentence
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.420]   of the paragraph essentially gives you the punch.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.640]   It gives you its proposition.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.820]   And likewise, Apostle Paul does the same.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.180]   He says, when I came to you, brethren,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.580]   I did not come with superiority of speech or with wisdom,
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.840]   proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.540]   Now this is one of those verses where it's just plain.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.500]   There's a simplicity to it.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.860]   But I would like us to try and put it in our own words,
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.800]   so to speak.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.940]   So let me ask you guys, in your own words,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.540]   what is he simply trying to say?
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:08.580]   Anybody?
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.900]   This one's one of those, you know,
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.820]   just clear statements, hey, I'm,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.540]   what's he saying, I'm,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.300]   (laughs)
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.120]   I'm leaving it to you to just summarize for me.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.260]   If you were to put it in your own lingo, so to speak,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.300]   how would you say it?
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:40.620]   Great.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.700]   Commenting at you plain and simple.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.540]   Excellent.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.380]   Anywhere else to put it?
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.900]   Or any, anywhere else to put it?
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:53.180]   He's just kinda saying,
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.980]   I actually haven't really been eloquent with you,
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.860]   but I just gave you the truth, right?
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.580]   And the reason why I'm saying this,
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.420]   in terms of asking you guys to kinda give me the obvious,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.820]   I know it's a little awkward.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.700]   (laughs)
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.980]   Those are always our most fearful.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.220]   It's like, teacher asks you a,
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.720]   I was in seminary one time, and,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.700]   you know, I was in the class for the book of Hebrews.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.100]   Teacher looked at me, and he said,
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.180]   who do you think the book of Hebrews were written to?
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.680]   And I went, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, you know?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.100]   It's too easy to say, I don't know.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.260]   (laughs)
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.900]   And I said, pass.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.340]   (laughs)
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.300]   It's like utter fail moment in my life.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.640]   But sometimes it feels like that.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.940]   But the reason why I'm asking you for an obvious answer
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.660]   is because sometimes the Bible's really plain and simple.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.780]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.280]   I wanna ask you this question.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.700]   There is a perspective to gain.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.100]   It's a plain and simple statement.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.680]   It's like, you know, I don't use the eloquence
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.340]   that all these other guys use.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.540]   And although you might seek, some of you Greeks,
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.580]   the kind of philosophy and wisdom that your other,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.740]   you know, orators and articulators might practice,
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.140]   I don't have that stuff.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.820]   He could, actually, but he says,
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.940]   I'm not gonna do it like that.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.260]   I just gave you the truth, plain and simple, right?
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.500]   And I think the thing about it is,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.780]   though, as he's saying this, there is a perspective.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.580]   There is a, what I like to call, worldview reality
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.900]   of what he is doing, how he paints himself.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.780]   And so I wanna ask you this question,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.860]   letter B in your packet,
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.520]   in what context do people give a testimony?
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.660]   What sort of context do people give a testimony?
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.820]   He says there, I came to you,
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.980]   I didn't use impurity of speech or wisdom,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.260]   proclaim to you testimonies of God.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.820]   In what context do people give testimonies?
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.980]   Courtroom, exactly, okay?
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.780]   And that's essentially what I would like you to envision.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.260]   There is this kind of question, you know,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.900]   Apostle Paul, you were kind of like a privileged few.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.460]   You had an incredible education, you had nobility status,
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.140]   you had the greatest teachers.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.780]   So essentially, if you think about it in our day,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.620]   if you think of Harvard,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.700]   and then the best professors at Harvard,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.300]   he was mentored by them,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.500]   and then here he is, speaking plainly,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.060]   like somebody who wasn't, you know,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.780]   just like average Joe, so to speak.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.980]   And so you gotta ask, why?
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.260]   Well, in my mind, the why comes from him revealing the fact
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.180]   that he essentially says, what I'm doing
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.020]   is I'm giving a testimony of God.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.260]   And when you think testimony, you think courtroom.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.060]   As you guys know, and when I say as you guys know,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.180]   people have said this a lot,
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.180]   and I know Pastor Peter has said it a bunch,
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.020]   that when you think testimony,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.060]   there's a Greek word that basically is a root
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.860]   for where we get the term martyr.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.260]   And that root is from the word that signifies a witness.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.980]   Someone is giving a testimony as a witness.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.300]   So we're called witnesses,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.140]   which means we have a story to tell,
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.580]   but is it any old story?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.520]   No.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.780]   Does a witness go on the stand
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.660]   to give a dramatic presentation,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.100]   and then they go off saying,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.140]   and the sound was like whoosh, you know, whatever?
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.780]   No, they just need to give the what?
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.460]   The straight facts.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.860]   They need to tell how it happened,
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.020]   exactly how it happened.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.460]   Their job isn't to make the crowd
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.220]   as the audience of the courtroom
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.540]   to be wooed and wowed or the judge be impressed by you.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.100]   You just need to give your statement.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.060]   That Greek term is also sometimes used to signify a proof.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.680]   Like if you were to have a case to make,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.340]   and here is the proof behind it,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.960]   sometimes that's the word that's used.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.740]   So how does Apostle Paul view himself
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.280]   and perceive his reality when he is preaching?
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.580]   Does he see himself like the leaders of their day?
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.300]   The people might want, you know,
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   the Hermes, the messengers,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.660]   and they want the philosophers,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.740]   they want the Aristotle's,
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.300]   and they want all these people.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.560]   Apostle Paul dare not try to fill that role.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.600]   What was his perspective, his worldview on his reality?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.800]   He was a witness.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.240]   He got slapped, you know, like knocked off his horse.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   He had a dramatic experience.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.360]   I have a story to tell, and the story is Christ redeemed me.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.440]   Christ saved me.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.180]   I encountered the Lord, right?
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.800]   And so here is Apostle Paul saying,
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.620]   and remember the way I taught you.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.480]   Think about what I was accomplishing, okay?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.720]   And that's really important.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.560]   So in this first verse, it's just a plain verse saying,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.640]   I didn't use the stuff of the culture,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.040]   I didn't use the stuff of eloquence,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.920]   the purity of speech and wisdom,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.840]   but I proclaim to you the testimony of God.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.240]   But he gives us a greater reason
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.360]   why he did it the way he did.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   So let's take a look at the next verses.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.140]   Oh, actually, ugh, sorry.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.960]   Before we get there,
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.600]   I wanted to ask you this question.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.160]   There's a sense in which a lot of verses
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.540]   actually are plain Jane and easy.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.080]   There are a lot of verses that are hard.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.560]   But I believe the vast majority of the scriptures,
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.440]   the important thing is God repeats in our plain.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.940]   But isn't it true that sometimes it's hard to apply, right?
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.680]   Let's brainstorm a little bit.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.540]   Just from this first verse,
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.420]   just from that kind of worldview of reality,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.420]   what are some applications that can come
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.480]   from thinking like a apostle Paul thinks?
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:48.140]   - Be straightforward and witness.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.060]   - Okay, when you witness to non-Christians,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.100]   there's a sense in which you need
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.180]   to be quite straightforward, okay?
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.020]   What else?
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:01.380]   What else can you guys think of?
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.740]   Just from this straightforward verse,
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.140]   what are some applications that you guys can think of?
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:21.580]   Sorry, a little here and here, go ahead.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.580]   - Everyone think about the gospel.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.900]   - Okay, there's a sense in which everybody
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.580]   is equipped to share the gospel.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.220]   Why, because every single one of you are witnesses.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.220]   And that means you all have a story to tell, right?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.980]   And so for the people who think evangelizing
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.100]   is very not much, meaning I'm getting real shy
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.100]   and I don't know what to say, I just mumble my words.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.180]   So I'm gonna give them money, I'm gonna give support,
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.020]   but I just never wanna do it.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.320]   You don't have to be a everyday street preacher,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.180]   but you're a witness.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.860]   You have a personal encounter, you have a story to tell.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   Okay, so everybody's equipped to share the gospel.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.700]   What else?
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.500]   You actually don't have to fear not being eloquent.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.380]   I think one of the greatest fears that people have
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.380]   is getting stuck, not knowing what to say, right?
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.020]   But what are some other applications
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.660]   that can just come from this?
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.920]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:30.820]   Okay, good.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.020]   So there is a place for apologetics.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.060]   In this specific circumstance,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.940]   that was not Paul's approach, right?
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.580]   Okay, yes?
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.920]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:08.300]   Right.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.640]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.700]   Right.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.960]   So there is, your question is actually pretty huge.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.060]   I can't answer it right now.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.940]   That's not to say it's a bad question,
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.500]   it's a great question.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.540]   Huh?
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.460]   Definitely, we'll go out to lunch, we'll talk.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.260]   But just to, did you guys hear his question?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260]   It's like, how do you balance?
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.420]   And there is a balance.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.140]   But let me say this, though.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.740]   Hands down, I believe in the sufficiency of scripture.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.260]   And there's a sense in which,
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.580]   should you know the revelation of God,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.460]   you have all that is necessary to win a soul.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.340]   Right?
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.700]   That's my personal take.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.940]   But I'll also reference to some books.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.840]   There's books that's just written on the topic
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.420]   of where is the place of apologetics
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.580]   in our Christian ministry.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.380]   And there is a place, you know?
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.920]   There is a place of understanding
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.040]   both science, history, culture, social,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.500]   you know, economics, all this kind of stuff
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.640]   in order to give a good defense of the Christian faith.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.960]   But I also believe that, you know,
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.300]   the scriptures, when we say it's sufficient,
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.600]   I don't think of it as, oh, it's sufficient.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.160]   I think of it as it's powerfully sufficient
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.800]   to overcome any thought, okay?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.640]   All right.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   It's a great question.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.920]   Well, that's not the only answer to that.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.480]   That plays a role, but it's not the only answer to that.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.160]   Yeah, but, you know,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.320]   just kind of thinking about the question, though,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   a little bit about, you know, the application of this,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.480]   I think, let me put it this way.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.920]   You know, for me, I really think that
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.680]   one of the easier ways to apply this,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.520]   and for me, you know, I'm an individual
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.040]   that's ultra-cautious of my words.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.880]   When I was, you know, my very first year
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.920]   in preaching, almost every single sermon that I gave,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   I had a full-on manuscript that I almost,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.400]   like, kind of memorized.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.520]   It was like 12 pages, and that was bad, okay?
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.080]   That was a bad way to do it,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.800]   but because I'm ultra-cautious,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.720]   and I always had this fear of, man,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.400]   how do I, you know, communicate in a way that's winsome?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.960]   That's important, but to me, the application of this,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.080]   and in line with what you're saying is,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.800]   I'm trying to shoot for clarity.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.880]   Clarity.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.720]   And to shoot for clarity, I just need to be
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.360]   super-duper accurate to reality,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.240]   spiritual reality, to the Bible.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.080]   I don't need to necessarily overcome
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.160]   every single argument of the guy that's talking to me.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.080]   I approach it with my apologics the way I do it is,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.280]   he might throw at me 50 questions,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.640]   but for me, I just need to have this guy
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   clearly understand spiritual reality,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.640]   so I'm only going to tell him what I think
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.140]   is going to help him be clear and accurate to scripture.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.320]   So my ultimate goal in my speaking,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.440]   in evangelizing, in counseling,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.320]   I want you to understand accurately what God sees.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.280]   My goal is not to answer all your 100 questions.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.640]   I'm not your, you know, whatever that is,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.800]   the little, like, wind-up, yeah, I'm not Siri.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.040]   So, that being the case, that's how I reconcile
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.880]   some of the difference between the two.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.360]   I am, I want to be ready to, you know,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.560]   take hold of every false thought and, you know,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.880]   all that kind of stuff, but my goal ultimately is,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.320]   I just need to have you accurately understand what God says.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.920]   But this one verse has a lot to say, you know,
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.280]   has a lot to say.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.960]   Well, let's move on a little bit.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   And, again, Apostle Paul, through this paragraph,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.600]   conveys to us further reason and rationale.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.640]   You know, he's trying to explain to them,
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.320]   I want you to consider my preaching,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.720]   and there is an important reason why I did what I did,
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.080]   okay, which is to speak to you plainly,
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   without eloquence and without persuasive speech.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.800]   And this is what he says.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.680]   For I determined to know nothing among you
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.760]   except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.120]   I was with you in weakness, and in fear,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.680]   and in much trembling, and my message and my preaching
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.840]   were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.640]   but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.080]   so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240]   but on the power of God.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.600]   Again, it's in there, it's in the paragraph,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   I know it's obvious, but please answer for us.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.400]   Why does he not use eloquence?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Why, when he is a smart guy, you look at the scriptures,
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.240]   you look at what he's writing,
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.320]   and it's penned through Apostle Paul,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.840]   and it's incredibly eloquent.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.160]   As a matter of fact, if you ever have outlined his letters,
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.680]   it's incredibly structured,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.120]   his arguments are always supported,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.740]   there is an outline or a structure
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.880]   to all the things that he's saying,
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.360]   but there's a sense in which, in certain cases,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.600]   in moments when he's preaching,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.960]   he will choose to not use eloquence,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.060]   the question is why?
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:29.680]   So what do you see there in the paragraph?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.820]   Why does he choose to speak in such ways?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.280]   - He wants to make sure that Christ is there
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.320]   and foundation for the faith, nothing else.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.980]   - Excellent, he wants to make absolutely sure
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.040]   that their faith is not based on anything shaky.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.640]   He wants to make sure that their faith
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.280]   is founded upon Christ, the solid rock, right?
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.040]   And he's so concerned about that.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.760]   And so as he's speaking here,
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.640]   he explains in multiple ways,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.920]   not just one way or two ways,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.720]   but he repeats himself, saying about how my message
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.920]   right, but in the demonstration of spirit and power,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.240]   and so he says, I want you to make sure
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.360]   that your faith is grounded on the right thing.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.440]   Well, that's something, again,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.280]   if you've been a Christian more than a year or two,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.880]   that's something you've heard, right?
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.720]   That your faith needs to be grounded on the right thing.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.360]   That your practice of coming to church,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.920]   your practice of being involved
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.840]   and participating in the membership of Berean
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.680]   or whatever church you may go to and all that stuff,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.240]   that it's grounded on the right thing.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.780]   But I want to ask you guys,
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.520]   practically, in living it out,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.000]   what would be an example of somebody
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.280]   whose faith is not grounded on Christ
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.120]   but is grounded on the wisdom of men?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   So let's try to flesh it out.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.680]   Like, in reality, what would this look like?
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.940]   Or I guess in, you know,
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.760]   in observable expression, you know,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   in action, how would this look like
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.080]   if somebody is grounded on the wisdom of men
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.680]   as opposed to the wisdom of God?
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.340]   (audience member speaking indistinctly)
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   Okay, so if you guys didn't hear her,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.620]   that's a great example and I think it covers a lot.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.280]   She said there are people who experience difficulties
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.360]   in their lives, hard circumstances,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.600]   and in those moments, a lot of people turn not to God,
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.820]   spiritual things, but perhaps just counsel from people.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.520]   Perhaps like, what did you do, you know?
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.680]   And sometimes there are so many different,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.360]   you know, so many different counsel that people receive.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.680]   There are people who will counsel, get away for a while,
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.120]   try to forget about it,
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.240]   as though that's gonna solve anything.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.480]   There are people who get different counsels like,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.320]   you know, if you, you know, wanna resolve this,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.240]   you gotta, you know, take it by the horns
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.640]   and you just bull those things, just get through it,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.060]   you know, does that really take care of situations?
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.820]   Is that what God is saying in Scripture?
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.440]   Okay, what else?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.100]   (faint talking)
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:39.120]   - You feel like basing your standard based on rules,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.240]   why don't you, like, if you go to church
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.960]   like one time a year for Christmas,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.360]   and you tell your non-religious co-workers,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.320]   like, man, you're pretty religious.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.880]   - Right. - I mean, well, I guess I am.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.960]   - So, do you guys hear him?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.760]   Like, there is an assessment sometimes
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.160]   that's really just faulty, and that's a key word here,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.520]   assessment, evaluation, okay?
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.920]   Remember, God evaluates on a different standard.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.640]   So many times I have seen stuff like that,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.920]   where, you know, Kevin said, maybe, you know,
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.240]   there's co-workers, a guy goes to church once a year,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.700]   and then his other co-worker's like,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.360]   oh, you're like crazy religious
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.560]   'cause you go to church on Easter, you know?
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.720]   Well, funny thing is, you don't know how many times,
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.680]   you know, you sit down with somebody
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.420]   and you ask them about their Christian walk,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.040]   and they're like, yeah, right now I'm doing okay,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.200]   and then I'll ask them about, well, what about your past?
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.440]   Like, how did you become saved,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.360]   and how did you meet the Lord?
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   And it's like, I've always been a Christian,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.120]   because my parents were Christian,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.720]   and my parents told me this was the right thing to do.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.540]   And then I'll ask them,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.880]   so when did you take that Christian faith,
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.280]   that stuff that your parents taught you,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.560]   and make that your own, like, this is my faith.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.080]   I believe it, I surrender to Christ, I repent, I believe,
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.320]   I trust in God's promises.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.680]   And they're kinda like, what are you talking about?
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.260]   It's always been mine, you know?
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.900]   And I'm like, no, if, you know,
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.740]   faith is like a house that your parents leave you
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.220]   as an inheritance, then sure,
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.960]   but this is supposed to be a reconciling with God,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.020]   where has that been?
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.420]   See, sometimes the parents have taught their children,
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.100]   having a religious facet of your life
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.580]   is really good for you.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.260]   And so, in evaluation of my life, I'm fine.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.540]   I'm doing all right, says the guy,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.120]   because I've been in it all my life.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.720]   Is your faith grounded on Christ,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.260]   or is your faith grounded on what your parents
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.440]   taught you was good for you, you know?
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.660]   Well, what I'm talking about is getting back to this idea
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.440]   of how the world evaluates what's good for you,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.880]   what's better for you.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.240]   And the world is always about self-improvement.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.120]   The world is always, always about, yes, you can.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.260]   And there's a sense in which evaluating that
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.700]   is incredibly difficult.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.400]   Evaluating that becomes incredibly muddy,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.880]   especially when it happens in the context of religiosity.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.000]   And so, think about that for us for a moment,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.660]   and try to dig a little bit into that question.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.860]   What would be an example of someone whose faith
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.920]   rests on the wisdom of men?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.280]   Perhaps individuals who are in the Christian culture,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.980]   or in the Christian circles,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.520]   trying to use the Christian environment
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.960]   as a means to stand out,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.880]   have a sense of notoriety, you know?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.160]   Have a sense of purpose?
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.460]   Have a sense of meaning?
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:29.600]   Is that resting on, your faith resting on that of Christ,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   or is your faith resting on certain ambitions,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   certain belief systems that tell you
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.120]   this is good for my life?
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.040]   So again, it's not limited to that,
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.600]   'cause again, the worldly wisdom is broad,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.140]   and what Apostle Paul is tackling is broad.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.800]   But I felt like we needed to give some detail
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.240]   to what he's talking about there.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.600]   So, in thinking about this, though,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.800]   Apostle Paul is concerned
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.280]   that if he uses eloquence,
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.640]   they might come for the wrong reasons.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.080]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.240]   What would be the result of people's faith
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   being based upon a preacher's eloquence?
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.400]   Where people go to church because there's a,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.640]   you know, standout figure, a Christian celebrity.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.040]   People choose a church and go there
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.960]   because that person, obviously,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.680]   has the spirits working there, 'cause it's huge, right?
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   What would be the result of someone going
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.840]   purely for that reason?
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.920]   Yes?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.720]   - They'll get tired of it, and they'll go somewhere else
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.680]   because they eventually get to know it.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.120]   - Exactly.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.320]   Time will tell.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.920]   You know, time will tell.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.040]   And that's something that, you know, as a young guy,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.360]   I've been kinda like learning a little bit,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.600]   and I still need to learn that a lot.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.960]   There are days when, because I'm a young guy,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   I'm like, oh, this guy's gonna be a leader.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.800]   Let's invest into him, and let's give him position,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.320]   and move him along.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.280]   But you know, time will tell.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   Other times, this guy's just not moving,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.800]   you slow, humongous glacier.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.240]   I'm gonna leave you, you know?
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.360]   But time will tell.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.160]   Stuff like that, I mean, there's,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.360]   there's an element in which you have to give things time.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.600]   Well, aside from that side note,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.080]   the fact of the matter is, in due time,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.680]   if they're there for the wrong reasons,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.440]   that will also be revealed, okay?
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.840]   And what will be revealed is,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.280]   much of what Jesus Christ says in the book of Matthew,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.200]   chapter 10, you guys do all this stuff,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.800]   but you just don't know me.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.840]   And what Christ says is, away from me, I don't know you.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.120]   And so, if you look at that,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.920]   if you look at all that in light of this,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.280]   you think, why, you know?
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   Why does he choose not to do this?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.080]   And why does he choose not to do that?
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.680]   And why is he doing this, and why is he doing that?
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.920]   For me, that is why verse two is there.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   For when he says, for I determine to know nothing among you
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.040]   except Jesus Christ and him crucified,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   it's because he doesn't want anybody's faith
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.880]   to be based on all this extra fluff, right?
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.960]   Now, we have to take a moment to evaluate this verse,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.360]   verse two, because in recent history,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.320]   meaning like in the last two, three years,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.600]   four, five years, it's become like a significant passage
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.160]   and a point of great debate in the Christian world, okay?
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.840]   So, in light of why he doesn't use eloquence
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.240]   and stuff like that, how would you personally interpret
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.320]   and apply this verse?
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.360]   For I determine to know nothing among you
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.600]   except Jesus Christ and him crucified, okay?
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.920]   And I give you some options here.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.920]   There is Paul, he's simply saying,
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   maybe like, you know, Eric, you gave a case
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.200]   in which somebody is evangelizing,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.120]   the other guy's like, yeah, but what about evolution?
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.480]   And he's like, forget evolution, you just need Jesus,
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.520]   you know, and then all he says is Jesus,
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.280]   that's all you need, right?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   There's another example, Jesus Christ and the crucifixion
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.840]   are foundational to godly wisdom, so that's your foundation,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.800]   everything starts from there, so let's start from there
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.120]   and let's begin there and focus there.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.040]   Another one, Jesus and redemptive sacrifice
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.000]   should be the only thing we teach.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.280]   Teaching commandments, teaching expectations of holiness,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.520]   teaching works, teaching deeds, unbiblical, why?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.840]   'Cause apostle Paul determined to know nothing
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.440]   but Christ and Christ crucified.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.520]   Another one is Paul saying,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.080]   I only preach evangelistic sermons.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.120]   When we preach sermons, we have to preach
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.320]   what will save people, Jesus and crucifixion,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.400]   the redemptive theme, the theme of redemption
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.640]   in every sermon.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.920]   There are other interpretations too that can come,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.480]   or applications that can come.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.360]   But what do you guys think?
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:56.260]   If you guys can try to like sum it up in your own way,
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.600]   what does he mean by determined to know nothing
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   but Christ and him crucified?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.360]   Yes.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   >> I think it's partly about the content,
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.520]   the key aspect of the content of what he speaks,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.640]   is Christ and him crucified.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.360]   But I think he goes much further than that
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.280]   because he says, I decided to know nothing among you
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.680]   except Christ and him crucified.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.080]   So in the context of talking about
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.480]   how all this other wisdom has been demolished,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.400]   he's saying that I'm gonna throw out this old worldview,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.160]   this old way of, this old starting point,
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.720]   and now I have a new starting point,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.960]   which is Christ and him crucified.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.520]   And I have to rethink everything that I believe and do
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.160]   and base it all on the core of the gospel.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.000]   >> Great.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.280]   I hope you guys heard him 'cause it was great.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.480]   [laughs]
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.800]   I'm not gonna repeat all that he said, okay?
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.640]   Good.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.080]   Yeah, I think if you look at it in context,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.120]   you know, there is such a huge contrast
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.440]   between the old wisdom and this new wisdom
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.760]   and this new wisdom has at its core foundation,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.120]   Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.120]   And Christ being crucified is truly
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.160]   the wisdom and power of God.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.960]   And it stumbles, you know,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.760]   it stumbles these religious higher ups
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.900]   and it stumbles the Greeks and the Jews all alike, you know?
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.880]   But by saying that the foundation is laid there
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.240]   and by saying that the core of the wisdom of God is there,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.640]   definitely we do not take this to an overstatement of
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.920]   and so therefore, Apostle Paul has denounced
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.240]   the teaching of other commandments
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.280]   or denounced the teaching of imperatives, okay?
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.440]   And I am talking about there has been a movement to,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.600]   not the whole movement, it's been good.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.400]   To focus on the gospel isn't good, is good.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.760]   But there have been some who have made
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.600]   a sloppy application to say,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.400]   and so therefore, let's make a rule.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.160]   Every sermon has to have the gospel proper.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.520]   Everything that we teach, how we counsel Christians,
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   how we evangelize the lost,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.800]   and all that has to look a certain way
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.440]   and has to have certain verbiage in there.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.000]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.760]   the gospel of God really is,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.980]   it can have a broad context of the truth and wisdom
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.680]   of God's saving graces, you know?
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.320]   And so I just wanted to make a note of it
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.400]   because I've seen it used,
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.700]   I've seen it applied a bit sloppily.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.320]   But for me, the point of it really comes back
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   to something important.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.640]   And I ask in letter C,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.080]   what was Apostle Paul trying to, whoa.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.240]   How does that read in your,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.480]   (laughs)
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.880]   it's like the craziest phobie mistake
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.020]   I think I've made so far.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.960]   I can't even read it 'cause it's like throwing me off.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.800]   Okay, what is this trying to say here?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.760]   What was he trying to avoid, okay?
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.480]   I left out a verb.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.600]   What was he trying to avoid
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.920]   by determining to know nothing other than Christ?
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.560]   What was he so concerned about?
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.040]   And we said it earlier, he was so concerned
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   that their faith would be based on his eloquence
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.720]   and not the truth.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.840]   And so that's why, and if you think about that,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.160]   verse three is there.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.840]   I was with you in weakness,
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.820]   and in fear, and in much trembling, right?
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.840]   What was Apostle Paul's weakness?
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.680]   What was his fear?
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.880]   What was his trembling?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.120]   Was it a physical trembling?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.520]   Was he a guy who had a speech impediment and he stuttered?
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.080]   Was he a guy who was a nervous wreck
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.760]   when he was in front of people 'cause he was too shy?
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.720]   I ask these questions, but we've already mentioned
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.920]   the answer that's been quite obvious
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.680]   throughout the whole passage.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.840]   But I wanna highlight something here, okay?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.200]   Apostle Paul is so concerned
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   that their foundation be Christ,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   I believe that is the reason why he is in fear and trembling.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.640]   We know for a fact Apostle Paul's not afraid
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.160]   to lose his own life, 'cause he just keeps going back
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.440]   after being beaten.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.520]   He just keeps going.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.060]   It's like, dang, you just got stoned.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.960]   You could go another way, you know?
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.660]   But he goes back.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.600]   We know he's not afraid of being isolated and imprisoned.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.400]   He will go gladly where the gospel leads him,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.280]   to preach to the lost, to go where the gospel is needed.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.480]   He's not in fear and trembling for his own neck.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.000]   But something that you notice in the passage,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.120]   he says, "I was,"
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.360]   and there's a little prepositional phrase, "with you."
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.440]   His concern is for them.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.580]   His concern is for their well-being.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.480]   For me, I wish that my understanding of spiritual reality,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.400]   my worldview of reality,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.460]   would impact my view of people such that
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.000]   the drastic weight of the result,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.440]   the consequence of your faith being grounded
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.680]   on something other than Christ, right,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.480]   would move me to the degree
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.920]   that I would have fear and trembling.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.560]   The weightiness and seriousness of what I preach to you,
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   and the result, if I veil the truth by my eloquence,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.920]   if I adulterate this by my showmanship,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.100]   he's trembling.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.120]   And the weakness he has is the weakness with the gospel,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.240]   with the people.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.640]   And it makes sense.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.860]   Right?
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.440]   It makes sense to me.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.320]   Why would division be the first thing he addresses
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.760]   when there's stuff like incest,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.280]   and stuff like immorality,
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.680]   and stuff like suing each other?
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.240]   Because as a pastor, his heart is for his people.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.120]   He loves them to the degree
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.160]   that it's causing him this great fear and trembling.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.240]   He is the pastor who planted this church.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.760]   He is the first pastor they had,
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.040]   and he was with them the longest.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.800]   He loves them to the degree, and he says,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.480]   "I am so concerned that your faith
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.400]   "would be grounded on something else,
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.100]   "and that's why I am determined to speak in such a way
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.520]   "to you, to give you the clarity of truth."
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:23.800]   So, how dare you guys divide amongst yourselves
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.560]   by loving worldly wisdom,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.600]   trying, you know, being the forerunners of saying,
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.960]   "I am better, I am better."
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.160]   How dare you, you know?
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.480]   And I think that's the pastoral heart coming out
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.100]   with Apostle Paul saying this paragraph,
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.280]   "Remember my preaching to you guys."
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.360]   And he wants them to remember his intent
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.640]   in the preaching as well.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.480]   All right, so by way of conclusion,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.160]   because Apostle Paul desired, right,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.600]   and that's an understatement,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.240]   how deeply he was committed, devoted, and determined
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.840]   that their faith would rest upon the wisdom
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.360]   and power of God,
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   he preached clearly and accurately the truth, right?
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.960]   Without fluff, without eloquence,
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.940]   without persuasiveness of speech,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.960]   but in its plain, plain form, okay?
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.400]   All right, any questions about this passage?
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.600]   Or thoughts?
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.800]   Yes?
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.200]   - Just one quick one.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.160]   So, without eloquence and all that,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.080]   why do you need to teach a seminary,
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.640]   why do you need to take a preaching course
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.600]   and spend all these hours practicing what you preach?
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.240]   - Well, number one,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   Apostle Paul made very, very clear.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.840]   He says give attention to the reading of scripture,
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.920]   to exhortation.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.960]   Pastor Peter just recently preached
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.120]   whether in Caesar and in Attasidon,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.560]   preached the word of God.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.960]   But he also taught that the man who preaches,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.560]   he has to be able to accurately divide the word of God.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.840]   Right?
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.040]   So, there's a sense in which, yes,
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.960]   can anybody as a priesthood of saints
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.920]   read the Bible, understand, and be able to share?
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.480]   But you have to realize there is a difference
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   because God has given very specific instruction
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.640]   that there be preaching in the congregation.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.840]   So there's a time actually I wondered,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.680]   why do we do this?
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.160]   Like, the pulpit, why is this the main attraction on Sunday?
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.520]   You know, this takes 45 minutes, an hour.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.720]   You know, there was a movement called
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.640]   the Emerging Church Movement
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.600]   where they tried to do away with it, right?
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.640]   They just gathered everybody in a huge big circle.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.560]   They said, "We're gonna have a talk.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.920]   "And we're gonna discuss stuff."
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.640]   And everybody kind of got a chance.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.080]   And they wanted to get rid of the high church feel
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.040]   of like, here's the pastor on the pulpit preaching.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.120]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.780]   scripture is really clear that the preaching
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.860]   and exhortation of the word of God
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.240]   needs to be done both in, again, accuracy,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.360]   it needs to be rightly divided,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.880]   and needs to be done by men who are trained,
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.780]   tested, and have godly character.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.600]   So in order to do that, there has to be training, you know?
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.440]   So yes, there is a sense in which
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.680]   he is saying, I'm not using eloquence,
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.360]   but he's not talking about in broad brush stroke,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.160]   any kind of speech that has an element of,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.360]   I don't know, like refined, you know,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.760]   talking or definitive talk.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.640]   That's all bad, that's not what he's saying.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.240]   He's saying resting on worldly wisdom.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.720]   And especially in their context,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.280]   where they loved eloquence,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.120]   they loved guys who'd come over
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.960]   and throw out new and innovative talk,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.080]   throw out new and innovative theories,
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.680]   talk about meaning of life,
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.440]   give them something to peruse about,
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.900]   they loved that stuff.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.440]   They had debaters and philosophers,
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.100]   that was their profession in life, you know what I mean?
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.560]   So that being the case, Paul made sure,
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.160]   because of the context he's in,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.000]   I'm not gonna use any of that,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.360]   but I'm going to give to you what's true and clear
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.520]   and accurate to God.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.500]   So, yes.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.460]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:14.620]   It sounds like Paul's kind of supportive of the church,
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.900]   and the kids were inviting people from different faiths
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.520]   to show them that's wrong.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.100]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.680]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.260]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:37.840]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:43.340]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.920]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:56.320]   Right.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.980]   (audience member speaking)
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.640]   Right.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.240]   Okay.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.040]   Yeah, so I mean, this would be good
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.620]   for you guys to discuss too.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.880]   The question is a good one,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.980]   and what you say is a good one too.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.100]   Given the context, there's a certain way we speak.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:19.000]   But definitely, we're trying to apply a principle,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.840]   and we have to make sure that we apply the principles
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.120]   in the parameters of scripture,
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.920]   and the kind of balance that scripture gives too.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.080]   You know, Apostle Paul, remember we learned,
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.840]   he is not using worldly wisdom,
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.800]   and he's not using worldly eloquence,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.100]   but he is using a kind of speech
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.400]   that's pleading with the people,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.840]   and he's winning them over, right?
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   So there is a balance in that too,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.800]   that we have to recognize.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.240]   But I like what you said, that given the context,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.960]   he's getting at them at the core of where they're wrestling,
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.360]   he's getting at them at the core of their pride,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.200]   and he's in the moment where he's rebuking them, you know?
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.720]   So again, context kind of dictates sometimes how you speak.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.520]   Good, any other questions?
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.480]   Okay, then I hope you guys have a good time in small group,
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.320]   let me pray for us, and then we'll wrap up.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.280]   Father God, we want to thank you, Lord.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:14.400]   God, I pray, Lord, that for us as Christians,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.000]   the stuff that's attractive would not be the same thing
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.160]   that the world finds attractive.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.600]   Lord, the world finds attractive, you know,
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   stature, physical beauty, reputation, high education,
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:34.640]   and the accomplishments that, in our foolish minds,
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.300]   think in this world and in this lifetime took a long time.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.800]   God, I pray and hope that our evaluation
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.000]   of what is attractive, or what is powerful,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.620]   or what is good, would come truly
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.280]   through the lens of scripture.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.360]   And Lord, that not only would be able
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.000]   to evaluate appropriately, God,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.640]   then that would turn then into us
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.360]   not seeking to accomplish those things,
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.260]   but rather, God, that we would be desiring
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.040]   to accomplish the things that are spiritually weighty,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.200]   the things that matter,
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.760]   and the things that have eternal value.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.240]   Lord, I pray for every single one of us
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.160]   that you give us true wisdom.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.620]   God, a lot of the teaching that we talked about today,
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.140]   there are good principles to take home,
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.360]   but applying them, Lord, we need your spirit,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.000]   we need your guidance, and we need your light every day.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.160]   So I pray that you would provide that for us
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.120]   through your grace, and it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.320]   Amen.
