[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 5, I'll be reading from
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.200]   verse 1 through 7 this morning. Hebrews chapter 5 verses 1 through 7.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840]   Reading out of the NASB. "For every high priest taken from among men is appointed
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.000]   on behalf of men in things pertaining to God in order to offer both gifts and
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.200]   sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided since he
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.080]   himself also is beset with weakness. And because of it he is obligated to offer
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.560]   sacrifice for sin as for the people so also for himself. And no one takes the
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160]   honor to himself but receives it when he is called by God even as Aaron was. So
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120]   also Christ did not glorify himself so as to become a high priest but he who
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.840]   said to him you are my son today I have begotten you. Just as he says also in
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.240]   another passage you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. In
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.360]   the days of his flesh he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.760]   crying and tears to the one able to save him from death and he was heard because
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.440]   of his piety." Let's pray.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.800]   Heavenly Father we thank you and we thank you for continuing to be gracious
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   to us. Lord no matter how much we study and contemplate and meditate we know
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920]   that we're only scratching the surface of all your thoughts, your love and grace
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.880]   that you poured upon us. I pray that you would help us to recognize even a
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.280]   portion of that grace that we may be in awe, that we may worship you in spirit
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.200]   and in truth and all that we do may be a reasonable response to your great mercy.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.840]   So we ask for your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.080]   You know yesterday I was talking to a missionary who's been out in China and
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   obviously there's a lot of things going on over there and if you don't know you
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.280]   know our church has been engaged in the ministry out there just in various
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.880]   capacities since 1999 and the genesis of our mission there wasn't because I was
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.200]   praying and God gave me this this heart for China. Early on in the church in
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   order to pay the bills I had to work as a ESL teacher and it was just random I
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.800]   had a friend who was teaching and then he was going out to missions and he said
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.320]   Peter you want to take over and the only qualifications that I had to have a
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.120]   master's in something so because of my seminary degree I qualified I've never
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.080]   taught you know ESL before I just went in and started winging it you know and I
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040]   just learned how to do it as I was going but I spent about five years teaching
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.840]   Korean grandmothers and mostly grandmothers and everyone said I would
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.320]   have a grandfather literally one lesson for five years mainly because they just
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.160]   kept forgetting and so it was easy for me because there was nothing to prepare
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440]   so you know it helped pay the bills it gave me insurance for the kids and so I
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.480]   did that for about five years but as time went by even though was paying the
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.560]   bills I was starting wrestling why why am I doing this because I put all that
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.040]   time preparing and studying and then I'm spending about 30 plus hours a week you
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   know teaching ESL to grandmothers that really isn't going anywhere you know it's
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880]   a lot of it is just to kind of give them something to do in the morning and as I
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.440]   was wrestling with this I got an email from our denomination saying that they
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   needed people to come and teach ESL and again at that time people didn't come in
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.760]   and out of China that's that easily like it is now there weren't a lot of foreign
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.280]   companies in there and so you have to have a special reason so I thought maybe
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.160]   this is it and so all the five years of training I told them what I was doing
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.640]   for a living and so that was how I got our church together you know did the
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.160]   training and then we started going out to China and so that was kind of our our
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.480]   entrance into China the reason I share this with you is during that whole time
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.040]   I was wrestling with what is this for you know I really felt like I was
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.680]   wasting my time but I'm sure all of you have different stories of how there are
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.720]   things that happened in your life that you didn't fully understand and then
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.240]   later on how God kind of connected the dots and that's what led you to where
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.040]   you are so whether you believe in predestination or not I think everybody
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   in some sense at least recognizes it it's hard for us to explain predestination
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   here like God's sovereign election and and how it goes forth but when we talk
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.960]   we always say well this event or that thing or sometimes very painful
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   experiences to how God used that to orchestrate something that he had
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.200]   planned and so any Christian could clearly see that now the reason why I
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.160]   share the story is because so much of Scripture when we read through the Old
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.800]   Testament that didn't make sense like a whole book of Leviticus there are
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.440]   certain events that take place that said what is this for and so when you first
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280]   read it you just kind of skim over it because you don't quite get it but the
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.180]   more you dig into the scripture the more you begin to see there's a clear purpose
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.400]   for every little thing even the thing that seems so insignificant the more you
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.440]   dig the more you see why that was there in fact not only was it there but it
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.600]   plays a huge role in connecting the dots ultimately brings to Christ now the
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.800]   theologians call that type the word the technical word the theological word is
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.600]   type that God has placed different types of Christ to prepare for the coming of
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.040]   Christ so basically is keep embedded into the Old Testament in history
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.760]   through the laws of tabernacles things that ultimately point to Christ so that
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.240]   when Christ came it was clear that that was talking about Christ so the
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.400]   tabernacle was a type to teach the nation of Israel the need for sacrifice
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.440]   and what Christ was going to do Adam was a type of Christ he was the first Adam
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.560]   that he comes and he as a as his fruits the whole world multiplied but Jesus is
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.920]   is the second Adam the sacrificial lamb is a type of Christ that the blood of
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.280]   the lamb covers the sins of Israel and so Christ becomes the lamb so he's that
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.240]   lamb was a type of Christ the Passover the sacrifice or at least attempt to
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:20.000]   sacrifice Isaac was also a type pointing to the sacrifice of the Son of God Jonah
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.760]   him being in the belly of the well for three days and then coming out of that
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.400]   was a type of his death and resurrection but all the types that are implanted in
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.000]   the Old Testament one of the clearest and one of the most important types was
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.200]   the high priesthood the high priesthood that is explained that we we took a lot
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.000]   of time studying through the book of Leviticus of the requirements of the
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.080]   high priests we're gonna be looking at chapter five six seven why this type of
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   high priest was placed in there and how that ultimately points into is fulfilled
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.920]   in Christ and it is so important for us to do that because you know a lot of
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.320]   times when you read through the Scriptures because we don't understand
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.280]   it we just assume like well it's not for me I think our elder James at the
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.240]   retreat did a in my opinion did a great job presenting the canonicity of
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.640]   Scripture like why do we believe it's authoritative and I know there was a
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.520]   quite a bit of information and so because it went over your head it's like
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   well this is too complicated well he spent most of the time describing the
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.080]   authority of the Scripture by quoting Scripture and it may seem like circular
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.880]   argument but the primary evidence of the authority of God's Word is in the Word
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.920]   itself because no man could have orchestrated all that we see in
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.520]   Scripture no man could have been intelligent enough he would have had
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.120]   enough information or the power to be able to bring all of this together and
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.480]   so the more you dig into the Scripture the more you begin to see how all of
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.360]   these things are connected to each other the end conclusion in an increasing
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   manner is this is divine man could not have done this and then the more you
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.680]   begin to understand it the more there is clear evidence that this isn't written
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:16.120]   by human hands again one of the clearest of these things is the high priesthood
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.160]   of Christ so today and probably for the next few weeks we're going to be talking
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.760]   about Christ as how he fulfills that type of high priesthood so the first
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   thing that he says about that is that Jesus had to be a man in Hebrews chapter
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.840]   5 1 it says for every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.040]   men in things pertaining to God in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:48.520]   sin so he said he had to be the priest had to be a man appointed on behalf of
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:59.200]   men so he had to be a man now again just to take a step back if we understood
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.960]   that there's a holy God who's angry with us because of our sins and we need to
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.360]   choose somebody to represent us to go on our behalf and to plead on our behalf
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.280]   not to be angry with us who would we choose what are the qualities that we
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.320]   that that that person needs to have okay do you understand the question so if we
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.840]   were to let's say we don't we were we don't have the access to Jesus we don't
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:35.000]   know him and if we knew that our sins has caused the God who created us to be
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.960]   angry with us he's just withholding his anger and we are choosing the person to
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   represent it as a goal and plead on our behalf who would we choose what are the
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.800]   qualities I think the first one that we would think of is he has to be one of us
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.640]   because if he's gonna plead on our behalf he needs to understand what our
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   problem is he needs to know what we need to plead for he needs to he needs to
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.320]   represent us so first thing he needs to be a man chosen among us and that's
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.720]   exactly what he is saying here that the high priest was chosen among them
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:16.640]   because his primary role is to plead for the people that he represents but then
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.880]   not only does he have to be a man he has to be a man who who can even have access
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.320]   to this God because any man who comes before the presence of God and has any
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.440]   sin what happens to him he dies no man can even see him it being the presence
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.080]   of his glory and so whoever represents us has to be able to get into his
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:47.440]   presence so he cannot have any sin because if he has any sin he wouldn't be
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.160]   able to represent even if he's the best of us if he even if he understood us
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.720]   perfectly and he knew exactly what to say he can never get to him he had to be
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.360]   perfect without sin but not only did he have to be perfect without sin his
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.120]   purpose of getting to God when he has access to God is to plead for mercy for
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.800]   our sins how do you do that well that's what he says the whole point of the high
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   priest sacrifice was on our behalf to make sacrifices to give offerings again
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:26.240]   for the purpose of appeasing his anger if you look at all three qualities Jesus
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.120]   walked among us he became one of us he lived a sinless life he was tempted in
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.840]   every way yet without sin so he has perfect access to God but not only does
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.120]   he have perfect access to God the sacrifice that he made to appease his
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.680]   wrath and his anger was his own life was his own self so if we look at those
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.600]   qualities there is only one person that qualifies and that's exactly what first
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.120]   Timothy 2 5 says where there is one God and there's only one mediator also
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.920]   between God men the man Christ Jesus only one person qualified to be able to
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.640]   do this task and that was the man Christ Jesus and John 1 14 is that in the word
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.600]   became flesh and he dwelt among us he walked in our shoes and he became a man
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   because he had to represent us before God now I think every single one of us
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.480]   like when you first came to church right those of you who've been here you know
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.080]   in the last maybe four or five years you know when you first come to a church one
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.720]   of the first things that we look for is to see who is like us right so if you're
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.320]   a college student you gravitate toward college students because you can relate
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.880]   to them better you know if you're a certain age you know a certain
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.920]   background whatever it may be you kind of naturally tend to look for and
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.840]   gravitate toward things that you you are familiar with you know I know that from
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.540]   talking to many of you that that many of you some of you were raised in a
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.760]   pastor's family right and so immediately I don't have to say a word especially if
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.480]   you're the middle child of that pastor's family right if you happen to be a male
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.280]   middle child of that pastor's family right and if you happen to be an
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.880]   immigrant of a pastor's family who happened to be a male middle child I get
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.040]   you right I get you immediately without any having any conversation we our
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.280]   natural tendency is we gravitate toward people that we are familiar with so once
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.760]   become familiar we can kind of venture out outside of that the purpose of why
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:36.120]   Jesus did what he did because his whole purpose was to bring us to God and he
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:42.320]   stepped in our shoes and he invites us if you notice the sportscasters usually
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.560]   they choose exports the athletes and reason why even though they're not the
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.320]   most articulate you know most of them did not go to broadcasting school they
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.600]   weren't communication majors they were just athletes you know but the reason
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.000]   why they are chosen to be the broadcasters is because they can relate
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.400]   to the athletes and so when they call the plays and when they analyze they're
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.280]   analyzing from a athletes perspective that this is what they're thinking this
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.040]   is what they're struggling with and so they represent the athletes well to the
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.920]   people who are watching and so the scripture says that Jesus was made a man
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.320]   because his role was to represent us to God it wasn't just that he was
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:31.400]   representing God to us he is our representative to him you know those of
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   you who've been to India with us I remember the very first year that we
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   went I think about six six or seven years ago we went to the boonies I mean
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.880]   it's about five hour drive into the countryside so when we first got there I
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:51.960]   would say the two-thirds of the road was not paved and even my even my friends
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   you know my Southern Baptist friends were asking me Peter do you know what
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.840]   you're doing you know this is a little bit further away and so we said you know
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.240]   what I I want to at least go and meet this guy and I want to meet his dad and
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.920]   see you know what kind of ministry and if anything that he said was true I just
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.040]   want to meet him and so we took a team out there and it was the boonies I was I
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.480]   would say about two-thirds of the road was not paid right now about two-third
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.360]   is paved and then the one-third is not paid but at that time was a two-third
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.240]   wasn't paid and so I remember going there thinking in the back of my mind
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.000]   what did I do right because it was it was in the boonies and when finally we
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.020]   got it to the city and when you get to a city that you're not familiar with what
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.960]   is the first thing that you do those of you who've traveled and typically when
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.240]   we travel we travel to places where you know where there's a lot of tourists
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.600]   gathered together and and every once in a while you might go somewhere where
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.080]   where you don't see anything familiar but when you when you go somewhere where
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.040]   you're not familiar what's the first thing that you look for something
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.600]   familiar right so the first thing we look for is McDonald's right is there
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.280]   are there is there any McDonald's here because even though everything looks
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.880]   strange once you enter into McDonald's everything's familiar
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.000]   apple pie Big Mac well not in India okay those of you who know what I'm talking
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.280]   about right but maybe Starbucks or something but we look for something
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.440]   familiar because that's our connection when it is foreign so when we think of
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:25.160]   God when we think of God oftentimes we see an image of God that is far and
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   distant so Almighty God who who created the universe and in a few donor pieces
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.360]   anger that he he comes and brings judgment and so we admire him and love
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:40.320]   him from a distance but Jesus came and he walked in our shoes and he suffered
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.800]   along with us for a whole purpose of defending us and representing us to God
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:52.840]   pleading on our behalf you know the public defenders typically in at least
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.760]   in our culture get a bad rap because when public defenders are really good at
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.400]   their job criminals get to walk you know what I mean and so is that all your
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.920]   public defender or how do you live with yourself you know and so we want them to
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   slack off a little bit because then more more bad guys go to jail at least that's
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.520]   what we think until we become a criminal or somebody that we love gets into
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:23.320]   trouble then all of a sudden this this public defender becomes our best friend
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.000]   the scripture tells us that Jesus is playing that role as a public defender
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.600]   but instead of being paid to do this he pays himself with his own blood to stand
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:41.560]   before a holy God this judge and he is pleading on our behalf does that give
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:49.320]   you some comfort I'm sure it does I mean when I think as I stand before this holy
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:58.680]   God that Christ himself is standing on my behalf pleading with his father right
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.840]   he says so he became a man for that purpose and the whole purpose is so that
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:09.040]   he can invite us so that's something familiar when we look at Christ that he's
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:17.000]   something familiar that we can go to to get us to God secondly the high priest
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.840]   had to be appointed by God now why was this important he was up to 5 4 3 5 no
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.280]   one takes the honor to himself but receives it when he is called by God
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.580]   even as Aaron was so also Christ did not glorify himself so as to become a high
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:37.080]   priest but he who said to him you are my son today I have begotten you today I
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:45.360]   have begotten you why is it important that that they were appointed now you
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.520]   have to understand that the nation of Israel was not like any other nation
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.400]   that the king of Israel was not the final king that those offices were
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.280]   separated so you can't just decide one day so you know what maybe maybe let me
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.440]   try the sacrifices you will get into trouble in fact we have examples of
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.520]   examples in the Old Testament these Kings who are presumptuous and they
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.880]   thought you know what instead of instead of going over to Jerusalem going to the
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.480]   temple I'm just gonna give the sacrifices myself and God brings
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.720]   judgment upon them because they didn't they didn't take heed God's warning and
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.840]   a high priest couldn't by himself decide one day you know what I want to be the
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.600]   king let's overthrow King David and I'm gonna be the king those two offices were
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.440]   completely separate you had to be appointed as a king and you had to be
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.720]   appointed as a high priest now the reason why this is important is because
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:47.800]   he mentions that Jesus came in the order of Melchizedek now this name it appears
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.000]   in Genesis chapter 14 18 just as a blip this is one of those things that when
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   you read it's like oh that's weird you know Abraham is coming back and he runs
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.200]   into this king of Salem and then he offers sacrifice and gives him a tenth
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   and then says hi bye and he blesses him and he disappears and then we don't know
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.280]   much about him so if you remember Melchizedek it's probably because you
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.600]   read it and probably asked that question and if you don't it's because it didn't
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.640]   make sense and you just kind of buried it somewhere and so that was placed in
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:25.760]   there and then now he's going to explain what that was again we're not gonna go
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.160]   too deep into it today it's gonna come out you know as we go forward from
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.040]   chapter 5 but the reason why this is important is because in the nation of
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.700]   Israel you could not voluntarily do that God kept this offer separate because the
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:46.960]   whole point of this King priest office was reserved for Christ and Christ alone
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.560]   so to take that role as a king to make sacrifice was no different than the high
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   priest entering to the Holy of Holies and sitting on that mercy seat that I'm
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.040]   gonna try this seat and God said no remember when the high priest came in
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.760]   there there was such reverence for the things of God he put it on a bell and
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.720]   he's to do his work you need to hurry up and get out because that was not his
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.600]   place the whole purpose was to with the sprinkling of blood to cover the sins of
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.920]   Israel to cover himself with his sins and then hurry up and get out because
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.680]   that mercy seat was reserved for Christ and so his high priesthood just as the
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.320]   human high priesthood could not appoint himself Christ himself had to be
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.760]   appointed meaning that his king priesthood that the throne that he sat in
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:46.440]   that he also was the high priest making sacrifice was uniquely Christ and all of
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.120]   that was prepared in the Old Testament and he gave bits and pieces of that so
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:58.640]   when Christ shows up there he is an aha statement I didn't know who Melchizedek
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.880]   was where does he where does he come from why is Abrahams giving tithes to
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.260]   him and all of a sudden he says Jesus Christ comes as king priest in the order
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.120]   of Melchizedek because the only king priest that we see in the Old Testament
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.520]   that didn't get into trouble is the king of Salem king of righteousness now if
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.160]   you fell asleep even for two seconds you probably what is he talking about right
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   but if you stayed with me this is huge this is one of those things that again
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.680]   in our life we have certain things that happen and we can't connect the dots but
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:40.520]   years later we realize wow God used that to bring me here this is one of those
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.480]   big things that God was doing behind the scene that they didn't understand but
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:51.080]   now when Christ comes he sits at the throne of mercy and that was his throne
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.200]   it was reserved for him and so no man could come in and say let me rest here
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   for a second that was reserved for him that's why it was important they say it
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:09.440]   was appointed to him not only was it appointed to him thirdly it says that
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.160]   not only was he a man not only was it was this prepared and appointed he said
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:21.200]   he was a sympathetic high priest in Hebrews chapter 5 - it says he can deal
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.520]   gently with the ignorant and misguided since he himself also is beset with
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   weakness he didn't just he didn't just establish he didn't just establish a
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.120]   mediator he established a mediator that was going to be compassionate and
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:45.840]   gentle now why was that important because if you send an ambassador to
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.240]   represent you the whole purpose of this is to bring grace and mercy so that
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.280]   people can come to him his whole purpose and Jesus's existence and his and his
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:04.880]   sacrifice was to draw us to to his Holy God so the sacrificial system was an
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   expression of his mercy even the sacrifice even all the slaughter of
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.760]   animals we may look at that and say wow that's harsh why are you killing these
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.120]   animals all of the slaughter of the animals was because God was trying to be
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.840]   merciful to sinners if God didn't care if he wasn't merciful none of that is
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.660]   necessary as soon as you sin you're squashed but everything that God was
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.600]   doing in the Old Testament was an extension of his arm inviting sinners to
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.000]   come and so the man that was sent to do his work must also be a gracious and
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.720]   compassionate man and why did he do that all for the purpose of inviting us to
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:55.960]   him inviting us to the mercy seat inviting us to the throne of grace in
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.680]   order that we may be able to be reconciled with this Holy God it says
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.040]   that because he was beset with weakness he can be gentle you know the word for
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.760]   gentle is really interesting because some of your translation says it's
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.200]   compassion but the word literally means to be in the middle right it doesn't
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.440]   sound exciting right that because he was beset with with weakness he can be in
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   the middle right now that's a literal translation of that word what that word
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:31.000]   means is he's neither harsh nor apathetic he's neither harsh nor
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.440]   apathetic that's why this word is so perfect for this scene because if he was
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.160]   harsh he would crush them the sinners come is that again you're gonna
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.920]   sacrifice again you're gonna bring that again forget you I'm not gonna sacrifice
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.000]   for you so if he was harsh he would just squash them when they send and they
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.960]   would deserve it or on the other hand is that you said it's like you know we all
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.160]   sin you know I mean we all sin and just kind of sweeping it's not that big of a
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.280]   deal don't worry about it we're not gonna go through this all them oh you
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.480]   don't have much money for these sacrifices you know let's just kind of
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.240]   you know do a little bit of this and just kind of sweep it under the rug what
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.000]   this word means was neither was he apathetic towards and he hated sin and
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.160]   yet he was compassionate and so he was a perfect mediator because he understood
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.760]   the wrath of God because he himself was God so he understood how his father
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:31.440]   hates sin and he knew that he couldn't just sweep it under the rug he couldn't
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.520]   just look the other way so I'm gonna pretend like that never happened he
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.000]   wasn't apathetic towards sin he understood that if something did not
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.520]   happen the wrath would come and crush all sinners and yet because he was a man
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.920]   he understood our weaknesses he was beset with weakness he was surrounded by
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.440]   weakness and so yet he had hatred towards sin he was compassionate toward
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.000]   the sinners and that's why this word gentle is such a perfect word to
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.560]   describe that's the priesthood of Jesus Christ and that's why you have this
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:13.920]   juxtaposition of the mercy seat as a throne of grace you don't think of
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.640]   thrown as being gracious you don't think of grace as having power and authority
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:26.080]   and yet Jesus's position is a throne of grace he's neither apathetic towards sin
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:34.400]   nor is he harsh towards sinners he's in the middle he is compassionate he will
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.200]   deal with our sins he will appease the wrath of God by his own sacrifice and
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.600]   that position was appointed to give to him since the beginning it was something
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.360]   that only he could do and that's what all that priesthood was for everything
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.680]   that we learned about the high priesthood was to prepare so when Christ
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:03.320]   did it that all mankind would see that and say aha he didn't just he didn't
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.920]   just on a whim say you know what we tried everything nothing is working it
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:17.840]   wasn't plan B from the very beginning that was his plan he himself was beset
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.040]   with weakness he surrounded himself and he tasted what it was like to be in
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.400]   sinful society learning on their sinful men being surrounded by simple siblings
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   even being raised by simple parents that he may be a sympathetic high priest we
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.240]   have a team right now that has gone to Ecuador and they went to visit we have
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.760]   about a hundred and forty three different children that are being
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.960]   supported by our church and I think we have about 16 or 17 members that have
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.960]   gone there they're gonna come back on Saturday and they'll give us an update
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:57.440]   on Sunday what they saw now we all know if you're one of those families that are
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.040]   supporting these children we're getting a letter so we have an idea we've seen
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.600]   pictures but it's a completely different story when you walk in their shoes when
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.200]   you go into their homes you know I had a chance to go to Philippines through
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.040]   Pastor Peter and my wife and an elder Philip but we all had opportunities to
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.760]   go typically when we travel we travel to the nicest places go to the nicest
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.480]   hotels they need the nicest food and I want to encourage you that if you get an
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.660]   opportunity I'm not sure if we're gonna go next year or not if you get an
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.600]   opportunity to to really invest that money and go see for yourself because it
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.960]   really is paradigm shifting and it's not like you didn't know like we know right
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   we know because we read it we watch films and television but it's completely
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.600]   different when you're engrossed in it and you begin to understand why certain
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   things are happening in the world when you watch from a distance you know there's
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.000]   a lot of young people especially so you know what the sex trafficking we need to
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.360]   stop the sex trafficking and so we need to find out these men who are doing
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.780]   these things and stop it and and make sure that the law goes and stop it but
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.560]   the when you get in there and you walk in their shoes you realize that so much
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.640]   of this sex trafficking is happening voluntarily part of the reason why it's
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.160]   so hard to stop is because they can't eat if they don't do that so it's not
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.520]   like these men are going into these villages and and they're preying on
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.240]   these young children all they do is they go on a tour bus and get in a nice
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   hotel and these young girls come to the hotel of course they don't want to do
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   that and a lot of times the parents send them because a lot of them it's a choice
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.840]   between selling their bodies and eating so when you step into their shoes and
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:46.480]   you you're engrossed in that poverty the problem is not that simple but we get
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.640]   into problems when we watch them from a distance and say oh that's a problem
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.360]   this sex trafficking has to stop and we try to get involved without fully
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:59.160]   understanding what's going on and that's why these trips are very helpful because
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:07.200]   you see poverty while you're there in a different light see our Savior came and
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.680]   he walked in our shoes and the scripture says in verse 7 the days of this flesh
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:16.760]   in days of Jesus's flesh he offered up both prayers and supplications with loud
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:24.760]   crying and tears to the one who was able to save him he didn't just taste the
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:32.480]   suffering of mankind he experienced agony he says he was crying in tears he
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.920]   understands he understands the agony that would bring him to tears to get on
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:44.160]   his knees and to pray till our sweat turns into blood that's how that's the
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.080]   kind of agony he experienced so now that Jesus who experienced that kind of pain
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.480]   Romans 834 says who is the one who condemns Christ Jesus who died yes
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.840]   rather who was raised who is at the right hand of God who also intercedes
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:09.000]   for us because he cried out in pain because he shed tears because he pleaded
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.680]   with the father he knows how to plead for us these aren't just empty words his
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:25.000]   compassion was earned even though he was a son he learned obedience he learned
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:34.600]   obedience he stepped in our shoes all of this for what purpose to invite us that
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   he's sympathetic high priest and he says come to me all who are weary and heavy
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:45.120]   laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.200]   gentle and humble in heart you know what's crazy about all of this the
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.120]   scripture says if you abided my words and my words abide in you ask whatever
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:02.400]   you wish it shall be done for you right but the problem that we have is rarely
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.160]   do we feel completely confident rarely do we feel completely confident that we
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.400]   are abiding in him and his word is abiding in us completely so we pray and
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.040]   we plead but there's always a doubt in my mind that I haven't done enough and I
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.000]   remember the compromises in the sins so even though we cry out there's always a
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.200]   doubt in our mind that maybe my prayer is not effective Jesus has no problem he
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.520]   cried out to God but God heard him it says because of his piety because there
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:38.320]   is no sin in him he has full access to God because he was tempted in every way
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:46.200]   without sin it is that Savior that is pleading on her behalf and if we have
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.240]   any doubts that maybe God doesn't hear us because of our sins there is no doubt
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.680]   that our intercessory our high priest when he cries out and he is praying for
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:02.760]   us that God hears him perfectly that's the high priest that's the king priest
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:08.760]   that we worship and that is the Savior that invites us to come to him and find
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:15.720]   rest there is no barrier there's only one mediator there's no other man
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.040]   there's no other system there's no other church there's only one mediator between
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:27.720]   us and God and is the man Christ Jesus come come to Christ stop coming to
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:35.120]   church come to Christ come to Christ and find rest that you will only find in his
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:44.760]   presence all this he did so that he can bring us to him how can we resist this
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:50.200]   guy I pray that the more we dig the more we are in all the more we are in all
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.720]   that we would truly become worshippers who worship him spirit in the truth
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.800]   Let's pray.
