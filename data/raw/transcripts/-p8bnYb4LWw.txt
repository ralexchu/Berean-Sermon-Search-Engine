[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   >> Good morning, church family.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   It's good to be with you, and I've just been meditating on just our gathering week to week,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and so challenged by what we are doing.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And we come week to week, and oftentimes it gets into a routine.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And why we gather together is to come together as the body of Christ to gain motivation,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   to gain insight, to gain a rallying, so to speak.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Whether we're doing things that are difficult or things that are happening week to week that are difficult,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and many of us are going through those kind of things.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But this is a time where we can come and focus our attention on who God is, what he's done for us,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   that as we sing these songs, that we reflect our love for him.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   So this first song, it's a call to worship.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's a big song, but we're going to have you remain seated.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   But just understand, and I hope and pray that as we continue to gather together week to week,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   that we come with a sober mind, that we come with a desire to see our God's name magnified.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   [Silence]
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   [Music]
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Let's come and praise.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Come praise and glorify our God, the Father of our Lord.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   In Christ he has in heavenly realms his blessings on us all.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   For pure and blameless in his sight, he destined us to be.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And now we've been adopted through his Son eternally.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Yes, Lord.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   To the praise of your glory, to the praise of your mercy and grace.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   To the praise of your glory, you are the God who saved.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Come praise.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Come praise and glorify our God, who gives his grace in Christ.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   In him our sins are washed away, redeemed through sacrifice.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   In him God has made known to us the mystery of his will.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yes, that Christ.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That Christ should be the head of all, his purpose to fulfill.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   To the praise.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   To the praise of your glory, to the praise of your mercy and grace.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   To the praise of your glory, you are the God who saved.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Come praise and glorify our God, for we believe the word.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And through our faith we have a seal, the Spirit of the Lord.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The Spirit guarantees our hope until redemption's done.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Until.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Until we join in endless praise to God the free and one.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Yes, Lord.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   To the praise of your glory, to the praise of your mercy and grace.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   To the praise of your glory, you are the God who saved.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   To the praise of your glory, to the praise of your mercy and grace.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   To the praise of your glory, you are the God who saved.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Amen.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Let me get started with our announcements.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   First of all, just to kind of give you a heads up, we have a church -- all church praise and prayer that's coming up.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Not this coming Friday, but the Friday after, just to make sure that you put that on your calendar.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Also, the family ministry retreat, again, August 12th through the 14th.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   So as you go outside, as you're entering to the cafe, you'll see a booth over there.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   If you haven't signed up yet, please go there and sign up after service.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   At least let them know that you are planning to come to that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And then, SAM245, their meeting is going to be happening on 5/28.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   So if you've already signed up for it, you should have gone -- be getting contact and let you know what's going on with that.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And then, summer VBS.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   So those of you parents who have small children, elementary age, it's happening July 11th through the 15th.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So the preparation for that is already happening.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   So they've already had several meetings to get things ready for that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So to kind of give you a heads up.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And then, one last thing is that our service auction, the fundraiser for the adoption fund that's taking place, that's taking place tonight.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Tonight, online.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   So you should know what's going on.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   All the information is on the church membership page, the Facebook page.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   So if you don't have access to that, please try to get on that page if you're a member.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And so all the information is there.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So you can go there and then you can check out what kind of things are already there.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And then I think you can bid for that, I think, tonight.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Tonight is the bidding.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   No?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Huh?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Two weeks.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Okay, I got it wrong both services.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Okay.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   So what's tonight then?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Oh, they're bidding for two weeks.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   All right.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   You can read it yourself, but it's happening today.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Okay?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Starting today.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Right?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   There's nothing live going on.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Close of auction.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   All right.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I need to review this stuff before I get up here.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Okay.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   All right.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   So let me give you a minute.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   I'm going to pray for us, our offering.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Again, if you are new to our church, our physical offering box is in the back.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   You can drop off your checks and cash or whatever you have in the back in that.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But the rest of us will give you an opportunity to give electronically.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for this week.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   All the ups and downs, Lord God, of living in this fallen world.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   The temptations that we struggle with.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Our desire, Lord God, to be near you and yet being distracted constantly.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Lord, we really need your grace to give us strength, help us to be focused,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   to continue to be united, Lord God, in our passion and pursuit of you.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   We ask, Lord God, that your spirit would lead and guide us so that what we engage in
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   is not simply putting in our time, but true worship, Lord God, that you deserve.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I pray that even this offering may be given in true worship, in spirit and in truth.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   May it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   30, 60, 100 fold.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   [Music]
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Church family, let's all rise together as we sing before our God.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   [Music]
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Praise to the Lord.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   [Music]
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Oh my soul praise him for he is the health and salvation.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   All ye who hear, now to his temple draw near.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Praise him in glad adoration.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   [Music]
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Praise to the Lord, all things so wondrously reigning.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Shelters they under his wings, yes, so gently sustaining.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Hast thou, hast thou not seen how thy desires have been
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   granted in what he ordained?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Praise to the Lord who doth prosper thy work in defending.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Surely his goodness and mercy here daily attending.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Ponder anew what the Almighty can do if with his love he be friendly.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   One more time, praise to the Lord.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Praise to the Lord, let all that is in me adore him.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   All that hath life have breathed down now with praises before him.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Let the amen sound from his people again, and gladly for all ye adore him.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Praise to the Lord, praise him.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Who else can make every king bow down?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Who else can whisper in darkness, tremble?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Only a holy God.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   What other beauty demands such praises?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   What other splendor outshines the sun?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   What other majesty rules with justice?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Only a holy God.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Come and behold him, come and behold him, the one and the only.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Come and worship the holy God.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   What other glory, what other glory consumes like fire?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   What other power can raise the dead?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   What other name remains undefeated?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Only a holy God.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Come and worship the holy God.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Come and worship the holy God.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Who else could rescue me from my failing?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Who else would offer his only son?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Who else invites me to call him father?
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Only a holy God.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Only my holy God.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Come and worship the holy God.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Come and behold him, the one and the only.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Cry out, sing holy, forever a holy God.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Come and worship the holy God.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   >> All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   I'm going to be reading from 17 through 25.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Okay, reading the NASB.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   [Reading Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25]
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Let's pray.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Gracious Father, we pray that your word would speak to us, revive us, renew us,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   help us to have a clear vision of Christ.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   What he has done, who he is, what he has said.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   May it all have a deep impression in our hearts, Lord God, in our lives.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   That we may continue to be sanctified according to your will and purpose.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You know, one of the benefits of being at our church, I think,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   is that there's an emphasis on the word of God.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And I'm very encouraged to see so many of our church people
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   who are engaged in the study of God's word,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   to the Bible study prepared, ready to engage.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And so I believe if you're at our church, you are, again,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   not just at our church, but you are growing in knowledge of the word of God.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And so there's a benefit that you know more and more about what the Bible says.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   But the danger that also comes with being at a church
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   where there's a heavy emphasis on the word of God
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   is that you gain a lot of knowledge.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And if you're not careful, one of the first things that happens to somebody
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   where knowledge comes in is that you get puffed up.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   That you tend to think that you are more mature than you really are
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   because you have more knowledge of God's word.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   The power of the Bible is not knowledge.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   It's not you have more information.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Now, information is important.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Because not knowing what the word of God says,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   you can have passions that are not based on the word of God.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   You can have passionate feelings and opinions of things
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   that's not based on what the word of God says.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   But the power of the word is not knowledge.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   The power of the word is your faith.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   That when you hear the word of God, when you study the word of God,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   do you believe it?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And that's why Jesus says in John 11, when he was talking to Martha,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   he said, "For indeed, we have had good news preached to us,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.'
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And he said, 'Do you believe this?'"
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Do you believe this?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   That's the important part.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Not did you hear it?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Not can you recite it?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Not do you know the intricate theology?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Because the hardest people to be around,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   the most difficult people to be around,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   are people who throw out theology.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Without affection for Christ.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   They can quote scripture without knowing who Jesus is.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And all it does is puff up and the word of God just becomes a tool
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   to examine other people's lives.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And it is a miserable person to be around when knowledge puffs up.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Power of the word is at the end of the study, do you believe that?
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   In Hebrews chapter 4, it says,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   "For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   but the word that they heard did not profit them,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   because it was not united by faith in those who heard."
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   So the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   are those people who heard the word of God,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   who heard the gospel, and did they believe it?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Did they actually believe it?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And it's also true of sanctification.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Sanctification isn't simply behaving a certain way.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Sanctification is you hear the word of God.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Every Sunday, every Bible study, you hear the word of God,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   but the next question after you've heard, after you've studied,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   after you've memorized, is do you believe that?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Because until you believe that, there is no change,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   other than adding more knowledge.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   There is no transformation taking place.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Your life doesn't look any different than what other people value,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   except your peers are in the church.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   So because your peers are in the church,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   the pressure you feel is not from the world,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   the pressure you feel is in the church.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   So you try to compete with other Christians to be more knowledgeable,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   to be more godly, to know the Bible more.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And so you conform to all of this because you're trying to move up
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   the recognition ladder in the church.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   But it's not breaking you.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   It's not humbling you.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Your love for Christ isn't growing.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   The way we look at eternity hasn't changed.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   In fact, it's a miserable place to be
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   when we have a church filled with people who are growing in knowledge
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   without growing brokenness and affection for Christ.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Because the key to everything that we are learning
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   is the question, do you believe?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Not do they believe it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Not what do they say.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Who do you say Jesus is?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   The text that we're looking at this morning,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   in Zacharias' response and the angel Gabriel's response
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   to Zacharias' unbelief,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   gives us some insight as to not only what God does with them,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   but how God deals with us.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   It says in Luke 1, 17,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   after he gives his prophesy, this old couple
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   answered prayer for them and through them
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   answered prayer for the nation of Israel,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   that their Messiah would come and deliver them.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Zacharias said to the angel,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "How will I know this for certain, for I am an old man
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   and my wife is advanced in years?"
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Now we can understand why Zacharias had a hard time believing this.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Because he was already advanced in years.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Humanly it's impossible.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He wasn't simply tweaking certain things.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   He's saying something supernatural is going to happen.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   It's like, how am I going to know this?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And on top of that, God hasn't spoken through a prophet
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   for over 400 years.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   So this was not a regular occurrence in the nation of Israel.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Every priest that went in there to burn incense
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   didn't come out speaking to the angel.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   There were 400 years of dead silence
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   and then finally when he speaks,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   he says something supernatural is going to happen.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   So we can understand that other human beings,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   why he had a hard time believing this.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Now this is not new.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   If you look at redemptive history,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   we see men and women whom God has chosen
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   because of their faith to work mighty things
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   and yet they themselves struggled with this.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Remember Abraham?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   God calls him out.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   He walks out to the desert risking his life, family's life,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   all because of the simple promise that God made.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   That if you follow me, I will make you a great nation.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   I will bless you and all the other nations
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   will be blessed by you.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And yet, if you look at Abraham's life,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   as he was wandering and following God,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   remember there were periods when he was so scared
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   for his own life that he would lie about his wife
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   and say, "Hey, make sure that you say you're my sister."
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And so we see a fragile man,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   even though there was a man of faith,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   he was a fragile man, just like us.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Remember Sarah?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Finally when God says that they're going to give him a son,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   just like he promised,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   remember how she responded?
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   She laughed in unbelief.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And as a result, God says,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   "Your child is going to be named Laughter,"
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   just to remind you how you responded.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Remember Gideon?
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   How God raises up Gideon
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and that he was going to dwindle down his army
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   to a few hundred people
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   to overcome tens of thousands of Midianites
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and Gideon's response is like,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   "Well, how am I going to know
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   that you're really going to do this?"
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   So he says, "Send out a fleece
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and it's going to keep it dry,"
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   and he's like, "to prove."
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Like God telling him wasn't enough.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   He's like, "Prove yourself."
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   He struggled with doubt.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Remember Hezekiah?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   When he was a prophet that came,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   that he was going to die,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   and then he pleaded with the Lord
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   and then he asked God,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   "How am I going to know this is going to happen?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   How am I going to stop or to move forward?"
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And so we see this pattern repeated
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   through mighty men,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   men who are supposed to represent faith
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   at certain periods of time, they doubt it.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   If we're honest with ourselves,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   we're no different.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I think the greatest struggle that we have is faith.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Sometimes our faith feels so small.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Even as we say we believe,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   even as we profess,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   even as we surrendered our life to Christ,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   from time to time,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   we feel like our faith is no bigger than a mustard seed.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I mean, just practically speaking,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   when we see Matthew 7, 7,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   it says, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Seek and you will find.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Knock and it will be opened to you."
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   I mean, we memorize that passage
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and we teach that to Sunday school,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   but the power of that passage is not,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   is not that do you know this passage,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   have you memorized this passage,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   have you dissected this passage,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   have you exegeted this passage,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   have you preached this passage?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   The power of that passage is do you believe it?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   That if you seek, you will find.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   If you knock, you will open.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   If you ask, you will answer.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Because if you believe it,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   you would pursue, you would ask, you would knock.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But part of the reason we struggle with that
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   is because we hear it,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   but it's not coupled with faith.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   You guys know that passage,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You know that passage.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   If you grew up in Sunday school,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   you may have memorized that passage.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   But the power of that passage is not,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   do you know it, did you memorize it,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   did you tell other people about it,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   but do you believe it?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   That if you seek His kingdom,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   if you put His kingdom first,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   that God will take care of all the other stuff.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   How much of our lives is flipped the other way?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   If I take care of all the other stuff,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   and I'll leave the stuff that I can't do in God's hands.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And the reason why we live like that
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   is because we profess this, we teach this, we exegete this.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   But when we ask, do you believe it?
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   We don't have confidence.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   We struggle.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   He who finds his life will lose it.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   We know that's the fundamental thing that Jesus taught.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   And when He was going to the cross,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   He said, "You must also pick up the cross and follow me."
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Deny yourself.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   This is the fundamental thing that is taught in discipleship.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   But again, the power of these words is not,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   do you know it, have you heard it,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   can you exposit it, do you know the context of it?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   But the question is, do you believe it?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Do you believe that if you live your life
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   to make something of yourself, you will lose it?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Do you believe that all the pursuits of life,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   so that you can have a better life here,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   that you're pursuing something
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   that eventually is going to ruin your life?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Do you believe that forfeiting
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   all the temptations of the world
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   will actually lead to greater life?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Not do you know that, have you studied that,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   memorized that, but do you believe that?
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Because if we believed it, our life would change.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Our pursuit would change.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   We struggle with that.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Finally, in Romans 8.32 it says,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   how will he not along with us give us all things?"
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Think how inconsistent our faith is.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   From week to week, to sing songs about God himself
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   took on human form and he gave himself
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   while we were yet sinners. He died for us.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   How will he not? If you believe and we sing, we memorize,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   and we preach the gospel to other people,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   that this is what God has done for us,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   and yet day to day we struggle with,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   does God really care?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Is God actually listening?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Is he really going to take care of my needs?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   And so we work hard to take care of all this other stuff,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   and then only the things that we feel like
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   we have no power over, we just kind of hand it over to him.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   So again, the power of these words is not
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   do you know it, have you studied it,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   did you exegete it, did you memorize it,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   have you taught other people about it,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   but at the end, do you believe it?
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   In response to Zacharias' doubting,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   the angel says in verse 19,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and I have been sent to speak to you
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   and to bring you this good news."
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Now, for us, we say, "Oh, I am Gabriel."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   What does that mean?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   A Jew would have immediately understood
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   when he says, "I am Gabriel,"
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   because the Bible actually only names three angels.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Number one, Archangel Michael.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And again, they're not everywhere,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   but when you look him up, Archangel Michael is the chief angel.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   And whenever you see Archangel Michael
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   appear in the Bible, he's in some kind of battle.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   He's the one fighting with the dragon
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   in the book of Revelations.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   He's the one who is gathering the other angels
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   and basically going to war, spiritual war.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   That's Archangel Michael.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   He's the chief of the angels.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   The other angel that's mentioned in the Bible is Lucifer.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Lucifer basically was a worshiper.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He was the chief worshiper in God's creation.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   But instead of worshipping God in the context of worship,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   he was trying to get worship himself.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Just like, you know, he was a great worshipper.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Imagine if you met the best worship leader
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   that you've ever met in your life,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   and he is trying to get attention for himself
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   as he is worshipping.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   So he may be the most skilled,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   but he's the least person that you want up there.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   And that's exactly what Lucifer was.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Lucifer's rebellion is that he wants worship for himself.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Isaiah 14, 12-14, it says,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   "How you have fallen from heaven, O star of morning,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   son of dawn! You have been cut down to the earth,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   you who have weakened the nations,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   but you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I will raise my throne above the stars of God,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   and I will sit on the mount of assembly
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   in the recess of the north.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   I will make myself like the Most High.'"
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And that's Lucifer.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   So you have the Archangel Michael
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   who is in conflict with Lucifer.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Typically we think God is in conflict with Satan.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Right?
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   The good and the bad.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   That God is good and Satan is bad.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Satan is under God's sovereign control.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Every time Satan, Lucifer, needs to do something,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   he has to get permission from God.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   The conflict that the Bible describes
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   is a conflict between Archangel Michael.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   In fact, in Jude chapter 9 it says,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   "But Michael the archangel,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   when he disputed with the devil
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   and argued about the body of Moses,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   did not dare pronounce against him
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   a railing judgment, but said,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   'The Lord rebuke you.'"
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   So the two other angels that are mentioned in the Bible
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   is Archangel Michael,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   who is in conflict with Lucifer.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   So the only other angel
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   that is named in the Bible is Gabriel.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Gabriel appears in Daniel chapter 8,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Daniel chapter 9,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   and he's the one who was sent as a messenger
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   to interpret the dreams
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   that was coming through the people at that time.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And so Gabriel is widely understood
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   in the Jewish community as the messenger of God.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   So when Zacharias hears when he says,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   "I am Gabriel,"
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   I mean he would have known immediately.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   My guess is he probably was floored.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   He was to the ground, he was like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Gabriel is here.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   That's what he means because the promise,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   the promise of the angel
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   is only good as the one who is promising.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   And that's why we have credit scores, right?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Like if your credit is like 500 or 400,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   you signing a name on something
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   doesn't mean a whole lot, right?
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Because you just don't have good credit.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   So when he says, "I am Gabriel,"
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   in other words he's saying,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   "I am the one who stands in the presence of God."
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   In other words what he's saying,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   what I am saying to you is from God himself.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   That's how he answers his doubt.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   I am Gabriel.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   I am the one sent from God.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   That's exactly what happens, remember,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   when Moses asked the Lord in Exodus chapter 3,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   "When you send me to Pharaoh and to the Israelites,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   who are you to demand that my people be set free?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   What do I say to them?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Tell them," what? "I am has sent you."
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   You're not going with your authority.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   You're not speaking on your behalf.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   I didn't choose you because you are the most articulate.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   I didn't choose you because you are the greatest leader.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Tell them, "I am has sent you."
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   The power comes from the sender, not the messenger.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   So when Gabriel says, "I am Gabriel,"
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   the one who stands in the presence of God
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   is speaking to you,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   he says, "That should confirm for you."
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   You know, typically, we ask ourselves in the end,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   I said, "The power of everything that we're studying
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   is at the end, do you believe this?"
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Right?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Not, "Do you know this?"
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Nobody cares what you know.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Let me say that.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Okay, does it sound harsh?
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Nobody cares what you know.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Let me say it one more time, right?
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Nobody cares what you know.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   If it fills you with pride.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   If what you know doesn't lead you
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   to point to a greater Christ,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   nobody not only cares what you know,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   nobody wants to hear what you know.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   The question is, "Do you believe this?"
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Do you believe this is the word of God?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   That God is speaking to you?
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   What do you say?
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   Who do you say Jesus is?
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Do you believe this?
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   You know, the typical way that somebody
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   would dismiss the word of God,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   if you've ever tried to evangelize,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   and say, "Oh, the word of God,"
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   and say, "I don't believe the word of God,"
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   because it was written by man, right?
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Have you heard that before?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   That's a common argument against
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   this being the word of God.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   "Oh, the man put it together,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   the church put it together."
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   And so if the church put it together,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   if man wrote it, it can't be divine.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   That's usually the argument that you will hear.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   I like what R.C. Sproul says about this subject,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and he says, "The reason we doubt the word of God
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   is not because his word is unbelievable
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   or not credible, but because we project
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   unto God the trustworthiness
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   that describes our own condition.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Let every man be a liar, but God's word is true."
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   The reason why they put forth
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   that if it came through human hands,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   we don't trust it because we don't trust man.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   We don't trust each other.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Man doesn't have good credit.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   2 Peter 1, 16-21,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Peter, James, and John
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   sees the transfiguration,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   hears the audible voice of God,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   and God appears and says,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   "This is my son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   But God tells him,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Jesus tells him, "Don't say anything yet
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   because it's not time."
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   But this is how Peter describes that incident.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   "For we did not follow cleverly devised
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   tales when we made known to you
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   For when he received honor and glory
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   from God the Father,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   such an utterance as this was made to him
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   by the majestic glory,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   'This is my beloved son with whom
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   I am well pleased.'
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   And we ourselves heard this utterance
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   made from heaven when we were with him
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   on the holy mountain."
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   He's talking about the transfiguration.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Can you imagine that impact
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   that it must have had on him?
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   He's talking about the transfiguration
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   and he says, "Don't tell anything."
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   And then he finally gets to tell people,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   "Man, you know what I saw.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   I actually heard the audible voice of God."
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   We've been walking with Jesus
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   but his glory was veiled.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   But for the first time,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   that veil was lifted so we could see him
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   and God spoke to us physically.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   But look what he says, 19.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   "So we have the prophetic word
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   made more sure."
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   More sure than what?
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   What he saw.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   More sure than what he heard audibly.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   The prophetic word.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   "To which you do well to pay attention
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   as to a lamp shining in a dark place
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   until the day dawns
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   and the morning star rises in your heart."
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Rising in your heart through what?
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Through God's word.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   "But know this first of all
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   that no prophecy of scripture
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   is a matter of one's own interpretation
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   for no prophecy was ever made
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   by an act of human will
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   but men moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   spoke from God."
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   So he's saying God has not ordained miracles
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   to bring you to Christ.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   God has not ordained
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   supernatural audible hearings
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   so that you can commune with God.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   God has not ordained miracles
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   so that you can hear him.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   He says God has ordained
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   his very breath in the word of God
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   to make it sure.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   So the question that we need to ask is
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   do you believe that this is the word of God?
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Do you believe that this is the word of God?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Do you believe that this is the word of God?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Do you believe that this is the word of God?
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Not are you studying it?
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Not are you meditating on it?
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Not are you telling other people?
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Not are you handling it accurately?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   But even before any of that
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   do you believe this?
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   Do you believe that Jesus is the only way?
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Truly the only way?
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   That there is judgment coming?
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   That the book of Revelation
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   is not just some fairy tale?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   That hell is not just something
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   that was written just to
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   just to tickle our imagination?
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   But it's real.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   That heaven is real.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   That Jesus Christ died for us, for me, is real.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   My sins have been washed away.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   It's real.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   That if you seek his kingdom first
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   that all these things shall be added unto you
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   is real.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   That he who did not spare his own son
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   but gave him up for us all?
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   That he who did not along with him
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   give us everything else?
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Is real.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   If you truly believe.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   If you doubt,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   that's where your struggle needs to be.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Part of the reason why there is
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   so little attention given
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   to the diligent study of the word of God,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I believe, is because we wrestle with faith.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   We don't really believe.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Or we struggle with belief.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   I mean,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   if I told you
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   that you got a letter from your favorite
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   basketball star and it was seven page
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   and it was written to you,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   my guess is
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   you would take time to read it.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   If you don't like sports,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   it's completely irrelevant.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   Movie star? I don't know.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Your favorite person? I don't know.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Somebody you love?
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   That girl that you've been
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   praying for so dearly
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   has written in response.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   And you get that letter.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   And then you realize it's like
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   six pages. Six pages?
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   I've got time to read that. Six pages?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   If you responded like that,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   I would say, "Ah, you're not interested."
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Your natural response would be,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   "Only six pages?"
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   You combed through that letter.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   What does she mean by "hello"?
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   (laughter)
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Look at the big letters.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   Why is there a comma there?
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   XOXO.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   And you would examine
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   every part of that letter
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   because every part of that letter
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   is personal to you.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   If you believe
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   that this is God's Word,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   that God wrote it to you,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   to talk to you,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   to bring you to Him,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   to tell you how much He loves you,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   the warnings that He gives you,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   to tell us how to live,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   to tell us what it's going to be like
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   after we die,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   to tell us
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   where the power lies,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   to tell us about our children.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   I mean, it's been given to us.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   But our struggle is,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   do we believe?
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Do we actually believe that?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   You know, sometimes,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   because we were raised in a church,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   we just assume we believe.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Of course I believe it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   And you just kind of give a knee-jerk reaction.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   But look at the way you respond to that.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Because sometimes we can easily fool ourselves.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   I remember
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   when I first became a Christian,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   the first person that I was so excited to share
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   that I became a Christian
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   was this co-worker.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   My dad used to work at this medical supply company.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And as he was pastor,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   that was his side job.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   So during the summer,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   I went with him to work for about three months.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   And one of his co-workers,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   in my mind, he was like
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   the most sincere Christian I've ever met.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   He always has his Bible.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   Every opportunity he had,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   he was reading it in between.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   And then every opportunity he got,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   he was sharing it with people.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   So when I became a Christian,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   he's the first guy I wanted to tell.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   So he came to my mom's dry cleaner store,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   and I took a break
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   because I wanted to tell him what happened.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Because every break,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   he was trying to share with me about God.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm a Christian."
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   So I sat down,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   and we had probably about an hour worth of conversation.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   And I can't even remember
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   exactly what he said
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   because I didn't know a whole lot about the Bible
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   other than the things that I learned in Sunday school.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   But he said something that triggered.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   It's like something's weird.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   And I asked him,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   "Are you a Jehovah Witness?"
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   And I could tell that just kind of like boom.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   Like he didn't want to tell me that,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   but he admitted because I asked him,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   "Are you a Jehovah Witness?"
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   And obviously, boom, the walls went up.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Right?
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   I have to be careful.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   Again, to this day,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   I have no idea what triggered that
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   because I didn't know anything about Jehovah Witnesses.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   It must have been something that maybe my dad said
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   that I kind of picked up subconsciously.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   And then boom, it went up.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   And then that encounter with him messed me up
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   because this is the most strongest Christian
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   I've ever met,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   at least in my mind.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   I mean, he takes his faith seriously
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   than any other person that I've met.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   How do I know that what I believe is true?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   How can I be so confident?
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Because he seemed to believe just as strong.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   So I went on this journey.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Even as I was professing as a Christian,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   in the back of my mind,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   I needed to know for sure.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   What if I say I'm a Protestant
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   because I was born in a Protestant home?
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   My dad's a pastor,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   so that was the only access that I had.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   So I began a journey to look for myself.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   So every opportunity I got,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   I started to study different religions.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   And every extra elective class I had,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   I would study Buddhism
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   and different Muslims and different things
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   and would come back.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   And the conclusion was,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Christianity made the most sense.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   But the next question was,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   then which Christianity,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   which version of Christianity made more sense?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Mormonism?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   They say they have their Bible
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Well, obviously, at the conclusion of that,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   and it wasn't a specific day that that happened,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   but after years of wrestling with this,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   my conclusion is not even close.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I mean, the Word of God, to me,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   without a doubt,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   proved itself that this is God's Word.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   And I could tell you
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   all the extracurricular stuff
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   where archaeological finds fulfilled prophecies,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   the copies of manuscripts,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   and how it was handled,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   scrutinized for thousands of years,
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   and how it destroyed the credibility
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   of the Word of God,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   and the other Bibles were just,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   you trust a guy who is discredited.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I mean, I can tell you about the stuff that I found.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   And it was almost impossible
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   to believe their claim.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   And even if you don't believe it,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   it's very difficult to dismiss.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   But since then,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   I can tell you with full conviction,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   the greatest revelation of God's Word
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   is the Word itself.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   All this extra stuff,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   those are good to have, right,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   as argument.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   But when you dive into the Word of God,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   you see the roots underneath the Word of God.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   On the surface,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   you read the words,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   and you see the connections,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   and you see how the themes are connected.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   But the more you dive into the Word of God,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   you'll see the roots underneath that connects
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   thousands of years of authors and themes,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   like just connected,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   one theme after another.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And I couldn't understand,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   it's like everything points to Christ.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   You know, as a young Christian,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   it's like, okay, I guess it is.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   But it is amazing.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   There is no way
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   that a human being,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   no matter how wise, how smart,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   could have put this together
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   in 1,500 years,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   45 different men
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   to have brought this together.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   And the more you see the roots underneath,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   you sense the breath of God in His Word.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   I don't know how many times
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   I'm doing quiet time,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   and just instinctively,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   I hear myself say, "Wow.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   Wow."
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Because I get to see a glimpse of God
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   through the Word.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   And many times it's through
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   the same thing I'm looking at.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I've preached through
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   almost every part of the Bible.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Did quiet time numerous times
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   on every part of the Bible.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   And even now as I'm going through it,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   it's like, "Wow."
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Because I still,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   it's living and active.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   The words that it says,
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   now as a 54-year-old,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   in the stage of life,
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   my perspective is completely different.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   And it looks very different
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   than when I was 16,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   or 20, or 30, or 40.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   And every time it's just living and active.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   It's never dead.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   It's hard for me to explain to you
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   what it's like to be a Christian.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   And I'm not saying that
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   you should be a Christian.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I'm not saying that you should be a Christian.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   I'm saying that you should be a Christian.
