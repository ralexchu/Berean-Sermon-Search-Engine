[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   (Pause)
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 10.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560]   We're going to be finishing up our sermon I started last week,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.600]   verse 32 through 39.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.060]   Hebrews 10, verse 32 through 39.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.160]   Reading out of the NASB,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.960]   "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.540]   you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.260]   partly by being made a public spectacle
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.400]   through reproaches and tribulations,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.340]   and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.360]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.040]   and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.500]   knowing that you have for yourselves
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200]   a better possession of a lasting one.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.040]   Therefore, do not throw away your confidence,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.860]   which has a great reward.
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.560]   For you have need of endurance,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.660]   so that when you have done the will of God,
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.960]   you may receive what was promised.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.540]   For yet in a very little while,
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.500]   he who is coming will come and will not delay.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560]   But my righteous one shall live by faith,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.900]   and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.700]   But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction,
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.800]   but of those who have faith to the persevering of the soul."
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.540]   Let's pray.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.760]   Christian loving Father, we thank you.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.860]   Thank you for the privilege that we have to come
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.540]   and worship you,
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.840]   to enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.760]   Lord, whatever we have been distracted by,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540]   whatever we have brought into this room,
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.640]   whatever we have been entangled with throughout the week,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.200]   I pray that this time that we may be able to offer it up
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.560]   and give to you a worship that you truly deserve.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.400]   May your word have its effect on us.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.160]   All right, so as you guys know,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.500]   this is the second part of the text that we're looking at,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.540]   verse 32 to 39.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.300]   And again, as you know, it is connected
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.400]   to the previous passage where he gives a warning.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   He basically had 10 chapters of calling people back
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.540]   to being anchored in Christ, the supremacy of Christ,
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.800]   how he is greater than everything else,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.400]   and warning them in the previous text a couple weeks ago
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.100]   that there are serious consequences.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.340]   This is not just a suggestion,
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.860]   that if a Christian or someone professing to be Christian
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.560]   continues to slide to the point
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.160]   where we no longer recognize him as a follower of Christ,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.660]   he says whatever we said in the past really doesn't matter
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.260]   because there is a stark warning.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.840]   In fact, the most severest warning was found,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.500]   again, a couple weeks ago, when he said,
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.740]   it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.700]   of the living God.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500]   But again, the point of that was not simply to end with that.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.140]   The point of that is for the hearers to have a seriousness
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040]   of what he's been saying all up to that point,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.740]   and really to get the genuine Christians
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.840]   to recognize how serious this is
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.240]   and to encourage them to persevere.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.040]   And so the exhortation that we're looking at this,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340]   started last week, was an exhortation to persevere
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.180]   by looking at the past,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.640]   it's an exhortation to persevere by looking to the future,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.840]   and an exhortation to persevere
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.100]   by recognizing who we are in the present.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.980]   So today we're gonna be looking at the exhortation
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.040]   to persevere by remembering their future.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.080]   But just so that we can connect this to the passage
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.380]   that we were looking at last week,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.380]   he starts by telling them, remember in the beginning,
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.240]   when you suffered many things
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.380]   and even your possessions were being taken,
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.200]   and that you had people around you
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   that was being dragged into prison.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   So this was no ordinary just kind of,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.600]   pointing fingers and people snickering at them,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.000]   we're talking about their livelihood.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.800]   Some of them, and they said during the time
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.580]   that this was being written,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.340]   if Nero was in charge, which most people believe,
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.640]   we're talking about a situation
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.380]   where Christians are being dragged into the Colosseum,
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.240]   being torn apart by animals.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   And he reminds them,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.440]   do you remember that time in the beginning,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.680]   when you suffered?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.240]   And we talked about that last week,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.780]   why would he point that out?
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.120]   If he wants them to persevere,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.140]   why would he remind them of the intense suffering
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.840]   that they came from in the midst
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.440]   of the intense suffering now?
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.140]   He said the difference between the beginning
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.320]   and what they were experiencing now is,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.920]   in the beginning, in the midst of this intense suffering,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.380]   he said they had joy.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.880]   Now that they're in this intense suffering,
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.540]   they're experiencing fear.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.340]   So the distinction between what they were experiencing then
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.720]   and what they were experiencing at the present time
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.580]   is the way that they were responding to this persecution.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.180]   And so he doesn't tell them,
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.780]   remember the beginning, how courageous you were.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.040]   Remember how disciplined you were,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.840]   remember how organized you were.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.740]   He doesn't tell him that, he points him back,
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.240]   the reason behind why you had joy in the midst of suffering
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.940]   is because you were anchored in Christ then.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.420]   But since then, you've drifted.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.140]   You have forgotten who Christ is.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.980]   He's not fresh in your memory.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.280]   You're relying on your own strength.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.940]   So now you're facing this persecution.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.280]   Instead of causing joy, it was causing fear.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.740]   And really, that's the whole point.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.480]   That's the whole point of what he's been trying to say
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.720]   all through Hebrews, and he's gonna continue this point
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   all throughout, that if we're not remaining in Christ,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.480]   it is not the circumstance.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.240]   Right now, we're in the middle of a pandemic.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.080]   We have an election that's coming up.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.120]   We had an earthquake just this Friday.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.980]   We had all this crazy fire.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.840]   We have civil unrest because of race relations.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.580]   We have missionaries who are being kicked out
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.780]   of the countries that they've been in for decades.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.520]   I mean, all kinds of craziness is happening right now.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.620]   The temptation that you and I can get into
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.580]   when things are stirred up is simply, wait,
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.580]   if we pray, if we're faithful, maybe all this will pass
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.780]   and we'll go back to normal.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.380]   And maybe we can get back together, enjoy fellowship.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.980]   Maybe we can go to restaurants,
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.240]   and maybe the political situation will be better.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   Maybe the race relationship will be better.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.420]   And if we pray enough, our circumstances will calm down
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.780]   and things will get better.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.220]   So persevere, stay the course.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.440]   But that's not what he says.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.980]   He doesn't promise that things are gonna get back to normal.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.140]   He doesn't promise and say,
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.620]   if you just continue down this path,
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.940]   just wait a little bit longer,
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.540]   that God's gonna deliver you from this
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.380]   and things are gonna be okay.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.120]   He doesn't say that.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.320]   There is no promise.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.620]   Now, there are periods of life where we experience peace
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.040]   and there are periods of life
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.620]   where there is tremendous turmoil,
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.540]   but God doesn't promise
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.480]   that we're gonna live a life of peace.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.820]   But what he says is the distinction between joy and fear
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.540]   was not the circumstance.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.740]   It was their anchoring in Christ.
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.240]   And that's why he says, do not forget.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.580]   And that's why even David,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.980]   when he repents of his sins in the book of Psalms,
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.980]   he says, what does he say?
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.280]   Remember that song that we sing a lot?
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.140]   "Restore unto me," what?
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.720]   "The joy of my salvation."
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.380]   The greatest concern that he had as a result of his sins
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.940]   was he lost the joy of his salvation.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.080]   So when an individual is not anchored in Christ,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.740]   any little discomfort,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.980]   any little thing that can go wrong
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.680]   causes turmoil, a relational issue.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.080]   Maybe you didn't get the job that you wanted.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.580]   Maybe the circumstances isn't exactly what you wanted.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.340]   Maybe you wanted to go to a vacation
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.480]   and the prices went up.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.840]   And any little thing can rock your boat.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   But when we are anchored in Christ,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.680]   even in the midst of suffering,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.580]   it's an opportunity to glorify God.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.280]   And as crazy as things have been,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.780]   and I think most of us who are old enough,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.180]   I mean, I think most people will admit
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.240]   that as crazy as things have been in the past,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.180]   this is pretty crazy.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.640]   2020 is pretty crazy.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   But along with the craziness,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.240]   we also have to admit that there have been more opportunities
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.580]   to glorify God in this midst because of this.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.140]   More opportunity to share the gospel,
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.580]   more people who are searching,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.900]   more people who are looking.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.400]   So when you're not sober,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.880]   we may just look at this situation
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.500]   as we need to just persevere and get back to normal.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.900]   And not looking at it as an opportunity to glorify God.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.180]   That's the difference between an eternal perspective
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.700]   and a temporary perspective.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.100]   So last week he says,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.700]   "Remember, because you drifted away from Christ,
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.680]   "that you forgot even in the midst of suffering
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.780]   "how you rejoice."
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.400]   But today we're gonna be looking at the second part.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.040]   The exhortation to persevere by remembering.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.940]   Remembering that this is not all.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.640]   There is a reward coming if you continue to persevere.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.800]   Verse 34b, "Knowing that you have for yourselves
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.540]   "a better possession and a lasting one."
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.640]   Not only is it better, but it is permanent.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   That whatever is being sacrificed now,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   whatever we need to endure now,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.640]   he said, "Compared to what's coming,"
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.180]   he says, "it is not worthy to be compared."
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.580]   Verse 35, "Do not throw away your confidence,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.040]   "which has a great reward.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.980]   "For you have need of endurance."
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.980]   He says it again, verse 36,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.840]   "For you have need of endurance
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.440]   "so that when you have done the will of God,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.540]   "you may receive what was promised."
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.180]   So he repeats it over and over and over again in this text.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.220]   That the motivation behind our perseverance
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.840]   is to look to the future.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.740]   Not to the future next year or after college
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.020]   or after you set it down or after you bought a house
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.220]   or after your kids are raised.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.780]   He said, "In the future, when Christ comes."
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:10.280]   And that's why he says repeatedly over and over again,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.140]   "The key to our perseverance
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.980]   "is constantly looking to Christ
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.520]   "and comparing what's coming with Christ
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.280]   "with what we have now."
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.340]   But if we're not anchored in Christ,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.020]   we only see Christ as an avenue
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.160]   to make this situation better.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   And if you're living by flesh and not by faith,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.340]   all we see is what is this gonna produce
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.280]   for the next stage of life?
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.220]   So I don't mind, just like we put money in the bank,
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.300]   we take it out of my pocket, put it in the bank.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.000]   If I can earn interest,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.100]   and then I can pull it out when I need it.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.820]   But what would cause an individual
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.160]   who has money in his hands,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.360]   security in his hands,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.860]   and to be willing to give that up
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.380]   simply because of a promise?
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.480]   That is not tangible.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.160]   You cannot see, you cannot taste, you cannot touch.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.280]   Why would an individual who has his security in his hands,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.740]   all that he desires right in front of you,
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.660]   to be willing to put that away
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.960]   simply because somebody said
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.540]   that there's a better investment
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.720]   if you persevere and endure?
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.760]   And I'll give you the answer to that.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.280]   It's pretty simple.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.580]   It's because you believe.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.820]   Only an individual who believes the promise
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.560]   of eternal reward would be willing to let this go.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.320]   There's a reason why, you know,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.360]   when we're suffering, we're having hard times,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.660]   and we can't find a job, we cling to God
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.940]   because we have nothing to lose.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.780]   You know, we cling to Him.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.040]   God, help me get a job.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.400]   Help my children be healthy.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.760]   Help our marriage, help this.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.480]   And we cling to God, but as soon as
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.800]   we have something tangible in our hands,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.760]   we don't really need Him anymore
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.880]   because I have what I need in my hands.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.120]   In 2 Corinthians 4, 17 to 18, it says,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   "For momentary light affliction is producing for us
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.640]   "an eternal weight of glory far beyond comparison."
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.680]   You know what's interesting here?
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   It says, one, this, whatever suffering
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.200]   that you're going through, it's momentary, right?
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.760]   Compared to the eternal glory, it's momentary.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.600]   And then he says, "Light affliction."
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.720]   Now, if you look at that and say,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.120]   well, maybe it's light, you know,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.720]   it's pretty relative, right?
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.120]   They're snickering and pointing fingers
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.100]   and saying, oh, I don't want to be his friend.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.960]   Is that what he means when he says light?
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.560]   I think you and I all know that the first century Christians,
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.480]   their persecution was very intense and physical.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.000]   You remember in Corinth, Apostle Paul was very concerned
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.200]   about going in there because he was being beaten
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.080]   and chased out from every city.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.760]   And Jesus had to speak to him, not to be fearful
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.440]   because I have people here,
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.560]   but he was heavily persecuted even in Corinth.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.160]   And when I say heavily persecuted,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.640]   we're talking about beatings.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.020]   We're talking about being thrown into jail.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.740]   Many people, this was already happening during this period,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.920]   but the way Paul describes it, it says,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.600]   "Momentary light affliction,"
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.560]   and the reason why he's able to call it momentary and light
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.920]   is because he's comparing with the eternal glory
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.120]   beyond what?
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.480]   Comparison.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.780]   He's comparing his suffering to the eternal glory
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.800]   that is coming in Christ, and in comparison,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.980]   it's momentary and it is light.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.400]   You see why, if we take our eyes off of Christ,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.780]   I mean, how can you call that light?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.280]   I mean, when you're suffering, I mean, it feels intense.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   And that's why his point is not to simply be courageous,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.320]   not to simply be organized and to be better disciplined,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.560]   but it says the Christ who saved you in the past
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.520]   is the Christ that we need to be anchored to that's coming.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.840]   Again, in Romans 8, 18, "For I consider that the suffering
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.140]   "of this present time are not worthy to be compared
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.760]   "with the glory that is to be revealed to us."
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   Again, in comparison, right?
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.480]   I mean, who wants to suffer, right?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.200]   If it's a safer neighborhood, I mean, Irvine
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.960]   is always voted as one of the top cities to live in
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.860]   because it's safe, and the reason why the property value
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.000]   is high, because it's safe.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.780]   Nobody chooses a house where it's dangerous.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.600]   Apostle Paul says, "But in comparison,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.460]   "in comparison with a glory that is to be revealed,"
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.200]   he said this momentary suffering is nothing.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.340]   And then in Philippians 3, 8, he says, "More than that,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.220]   "I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.360]   "value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.680]   In comparison, remember Apostle Paul?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.480]   Remember who he was before he met Christ?
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.040]   Apostle Paul was already famous.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.680]   He was one of the top scholars in the Jewish community.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.060]   People say that he may have already been a member
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.060]   of the Sanhedrin, one of the senators of Israel.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.600]   He was already a rich man.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.200]   He already had the Roman citizenship.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.760]   He was already at the apex of what the Jewish community
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.840]   would have wanted, even just a portion
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.120]   of what Apostle Paul had.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.680]   But he says, in all that he has had, all the respect,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.160]   all the money, all the honor, all the fame that he had,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.860]   all the political power that he had, he says,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.640]   "In comparison to the surpassing knowledge
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.360]   "of knowing Jesus Christ, it became," what?
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.200]   Dung.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.600]   So the moment we take our eyes off of Christ,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.080]   how can we in our flesh look at what Apostle Paul had
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   and say it was dung?
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.200]   We don't look at winning the lottery as dung.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.080]   We don't look at moving into a nice house as dung.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.280]   We don't look at getting promotions in our work as dung.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.560]   When these things happen, we say, "God was so good to me.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.040]   "What a blessing that my business is doing well.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.740]   "What a blessing my child was sick and now he is well."
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.460]   Nobody looks at that and says, "It's dung."
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.060]   It is only in comparison to the surpassing knowledge
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.020]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.860]   So therefore, once we begin to drift away from him,
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.980]   you cannot in your flesh win over the temptation,
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.680]   especially where you and I live.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.140]   I mean, you and I live in an area where if we dream it,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.100]   we can actually do it.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.120]   I mean, some of you guys may know,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.040]   some of you guys may be shocking to you.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.880]   Majority of the world does not get to look at a magazine
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.180]   in a beautiful place and say, "I'm gonna go there one day."
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.480]   That's ridiculous.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.020]   Majority, 99% of the world does not have the opportunity.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.880]   That's just a fantasy.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.580]   That's just like me saying, "One day, I'm gonna fly."
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.240]   Because they're struggling to feed their children.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   They're struggling to get a job.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.720]   But in where you and I live, we think about career.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.480]   Am I satisfied in my career?
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.840]   Even that idea of career, there's a bunch of things
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.200]   that you and I do that people in the world
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.000]   would not understand, garage sales.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.800]   The idea of having too much, so we gotta sell it for cheap.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.040]   Something that I bought, upgrading our phones.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.880]   These are things that if you travel around
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   the majority of the world, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.120]   But you and I live in this place
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.800]   where we are constantly bombarded.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.040]   Everything that we see, if you eat it,
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.880]   that's on my bucket list.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.760]   I'm gonna go there, and we can actually go.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.460]   It's just a matter of making time.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.760]   You and I cannot, by our own flesh,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.880]   win the temptation that you and I are surrounded by.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.800]   It is only in comparison to the surpassing knowledge
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   of knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.280]   So the moment you take your eyes off of that,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.040]   temptation will creep in.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.280]   It is impossible to win over the temptation
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   when we have drifted away from Christ.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.120]   That's why he says, "Do not throw away your confidence."
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.400]   Okay, so we're doing inductive Bible study.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.020]   And in interpreting a text, what is one of the most
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.280]   important things that you need to do
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.480]   in understanding a text?
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.600]   Starts with a C.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.500]   Context, right?
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.400]   You guys have your mask on, so I have no idea
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.240]   what you're saying.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.480]   Context.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.000]   So context, context, context.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.440]   So if I say, "The bomb,"
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   you don't really know what I mean.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.720]   I could mean there was a terrorist
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.960]   that planted a bomb to get out.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.160]   Or I could mean, "That was awesome."
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.200]   The bomb.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.620]   So you have to know, is that part of my normal vocabulary?
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.040]   Just kidding.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.780]   Right?
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.960]   So, I mean, again, I didn't grow up using that term,
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.880]   so when you say, "Oh, the bomb,"
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.440]   normally that's not how I talk,
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.120]   so you have to understand the context of who I am,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.960]   how old I am, would I use that, have I used that before?
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.800]   So all of that.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.680]   So when we're interpreting the scripture,
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.880]   you can't just take, this is what you think it means,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.320]   and just add it to that.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.120]   That's why the digging happens, right?
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.560]   That's why we're asking questions,
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.300]   and you have to understand the context.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.440]   How did he use that word?
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   What does he mean by that?
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.620]   So when the author says,
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.560]   "Do not throw away your confidence,"
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.960]   the word confidence simply means to be bold.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.480]   But boldness can mean a lot of things, too, right?
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.160]   It can be bold, being courageous, not having fear.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.520]   But what is this confidence,
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.920]   this boldness that he's referring to?
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.760]   Well, the author uses it several times
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.320]   prior to using it here, and so let me look at this
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.880]   so that we can have a better understanding
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.400]   when he says, "Do not throw away your confidence,"
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.320]   Hebrews 3:6.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.880]   But Christ was faithful as a son over his house,
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.400]   whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   and boast of our hope firm until the end.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.240]   What does he mean here by confidence?
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.680]   Your courage?
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.040]   What does he mean by here, confidence?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   He's talking about the blood sacrifice of Christ,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.360]   that our confidence to come to Christ
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.760]   isn't because you're bold, isn't because you're righteous,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.520]   isn't because you've done these great things.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.400]   He says, "No, do not throw away the open door
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.360]   "that Christ has given you, the blood sacrifice,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.200]   "so you are able to be bold."
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.240]   Again, he says it in Hebrews 4:16.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.600]   "Therefore, let us draw near with confidence
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.780]   "the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.600]   "and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.480]   So what does he mean by confidence?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.160]   Because you're older, because you're more experienced,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.520]   because you study the Bible better,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.240]   because you have a position in the church.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.240]   What does he mean by that?
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.040]   The blood sacrifice of Christ.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.320]   He said we are able to enter the throne of grace
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.520]   with confidence because Christ covers us in our sins,
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.400]   because we have been atoned for,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.720]   our sins have been atoned for.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.940]   So he says we can draw near to the throne,
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.540]   the throne, the king, with confidence.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.660]   He's not talking about us.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.260]   He's not talking about our righteousness.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.660]   He's talking about the imputed righteousness of Christ.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.720]   Again, in Hebrews 10, 19 to 20.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.180]   "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.500]   "to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.380]   "by a new and living way, which he inaugurated for us
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.140]   "through the veil that is his flesh."
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.200]   Just in case we didn't know,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.020]   just in case after he said all of this
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.520]   that anybody was missing the point,
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.220]   he actually describes it here.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   Confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.840]   The living way, a new way.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.060]   So what does he mean here?
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.080]   Do not throw away your confidence.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.680]   Meaning, do not try to continue on this path
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.540]   by your own strength.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.460]   You're not gonna be able to make it.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.720]   If we drift from being anchored in Christ,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.500]   the Christ who justified us,
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.700]   and the Christ who will glorify us,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.620]   and if we try to add anything to that,
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.000]   you will end up throwing away your confidence.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.140]   The only way that you can have confidence
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.060]   to enter the throne of grace.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   And that's what he means, to be anchored.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.100]   And there's a reason why Jesus,
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.340]   in his seven I Am statements in the book of John,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.660]   his last thing that he tells his disciples to do what?
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.260]   To remain.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.020]   He doesn't say go, before he goes, you have to remain.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.260]   Before you preach the gospel,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:13.100]   before you convert unbelievers to Christ,
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.420]   before you engage in this spiritual battle,
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.380]   he says to remain.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.460]   That's why a Christian who's studying the Bible,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.080]   but is not praying, is completely impotent.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.480]   Because it is not our knowledge,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.760]   it is not our will, it is not our courage.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.960]   It is by his might, it is by his strength.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.140]   And that's why he says, you have to remain.
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.140]   You cannot bear fruit.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.240]   You cannot engage in this spiritual battle
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.760]   unless we remain, continue in Christ.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.440]   Unless we are absolutely dependent and anchored
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.840]   in the Christ who saved us,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.160]   and in the Christ who will glorify us.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.440]   That's what he means by confidence.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.240]   Do not forsake this confidence.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.440]   You know, the problem is, when we first become Christians,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.500]   you know, we are so enamored by our justification.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.240]   And we're humbled, usually.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.440]   Because we've just recognized
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.680]   that every righteous deed that we did,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.440]   and we recognize all the sinful things that we have done.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.200]   And so we come to church and we're humbled.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.640]   We wanna know what the Bible says.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.120]   Every song, every word is impacting us
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.040]   because that's me, that's what he did for me.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.100]   But for whatever the reason, after two months,
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.020]   a year, 10 years, 30 years,
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.760]   we add to our justification our works.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.760]   That I've done this and I've done that,
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.040]   and we compare our righteousness,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.680]   at least I'm not as bad as them.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.800]   You know, I know I'm not perfect.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   And whenever somebody states that,
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.720]   states anything with I know I'm not perfect,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.520]   you know what's coming, right?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.800]   I know I'm not perfect, but I'm not as bad as them.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.880]   So for whatever the reason, we start out with justification,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   and then we add our own righteousness as we go along.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.600]   And the longer that we've been a Christian,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.200]   the longer we compare our righteousness to other people.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.740]   And we're no longer students.
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.400]   We're mighty warriors by our own strength.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.360]   And we become absolutely impotent.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.880]   That's what he means.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.660]   There is not a single person in this room
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.820]   who is not in dire need to fight to remain in Christ.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.720]   You know when you really need to remain?
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.820]   Is when you're young.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.800]   You know, when you're in high school,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.760]   or you just graduated high school,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.680]   and you're college students,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.720]   man, you really need to remain in Christ.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.800]   You are desperately in need of Christ.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.040]   'Cause you have freedom now all of a sudden.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.440]   You don't have your parents looking over your shoulder,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.360]   and all of a sudden you're able to stay out late,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.720]   hang out with your friends.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.320]   And there is great temptation that comes with the freedom.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.780]   With all the choices that are in front of you.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.780]   So if you don't anchor yourself to Christ,
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.120]   you can easily drift.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.540]   You know who else is in need of desperate,
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.680]   hanging on to Christ?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.860]   Those of you who just graduated.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.960]   You just graduated, you're in the workforce,
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.880]   and you have a job, and you're working,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.800]   and all of a sudden you don't have the accountability
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.200]   that you had before.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.040]   The majority of the people that are surrounding you
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.080]   are not like you.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.880]   In fact, you're kind of weird.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.200]   And so you're being tempted to drift.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.680]   So if you're not anchored in Christ during that period,
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.160]   you can easily drift.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.240]   In fact, the statistics say more than 60, 70%,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.480]   by the time they graduate, before they become 30,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.520]   they've already drifted and they're gone.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.680]   You know who really needs to really cling on to Christ?
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.840]   Those of you who are dating.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.680]   Those of you who are dating,
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.160]   you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.640]   The temptation, the struggle,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.920]   and even the miscommunication.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.120]   Your world gets flipped over upside down
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.160]   every time you have a fight.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.120]   And if you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.720]   it's a very, very difficult period of life
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.280]   that you're not gonna make it through.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.920]   You have to anchor in Christ, you're desperate.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.120]   You know who else needs to really cling to Christ?
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.720]   Those of you who are not dating.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.960]   You know, you're living in coveting and watching,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.440]   and say, "Why isn't this happening to me?"
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.280]   And then your coveting and your mind starts to drift away,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.080]   and then after a while, it's like, "Why is God,
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.640]   "why did God put me in this situation?"
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.600]   And your coveting causes you to drift away from Christ.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.320]   And if you're not careful and you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.640]   this envying and desiring,
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.160]   and all you are thinking about is the next stage of life,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.560]   and if you're not anchored in Christ, you can easily drift.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.680]   You know who else needs to really be anchored in Christ?
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.600]   Those of you who are engaged.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.920]   And you're looking to the next stage of life,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.280]   and then those of you who just got married,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.720]   and all of a sudden you feel like you've arrived,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.840]   and then you're no longer actively pursuing Christ anymore
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.080]   because you're relaxed, you know?
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.240]   And you're just waiting to have kids
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.160]   and get to the next stage,
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.480]   you're enjoying the things that God has given you,
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.720]   the next thing you know, you've drifted together.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.360]   It's much harder to remain sober together.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.320]   So during that period, if you're not really anchored
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.720]   in Christ, you can easily drift away.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.000]   You know who else really needs to be anchored in Christ?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.480]   Brand new children, the parents who have kids.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.280]   Oh my gosh, I don't even have to explain.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.120]   Everybody who's like half falling asleep,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.440]   or the parents who didn't get enough sleep last night,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.840]   they're free, what do you do in your free time?
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.480]   And they get angry that you asked them that.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.320]   Right?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.160]   Free time, what is that?
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   So if you're not anchored in Christ during that period,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.680]   you're not even doing anything bad.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.920]   You're just trying to feed them and take care of them
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   and make sure they're not sick and not getting hurt.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.640]   And you're literally giving your life
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.080]   for another human being, and you're huffing and puffing
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.800]   just to make it to the next week.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.480]   If you're not anchored in Christ,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.640]   you do that for a year, two years, five years, 10 years,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.480]   next thing you know, you don't even remember
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.440]   what you were like before you had kids.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.360]   But you know who really needs to be anchored in Christ?
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.760]   You know, parents who have children
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.640]   who are beginning to grow up and move out.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.800]   You know, as we hit our 50s and 60s,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.680]   we kind of drift into this oblivion,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.080]   thinking like, oh, hard life is behind us,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.400]   and we can just kind of drift and just kind of coast along,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.560]   you know, waiting for retirement to happen,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.400]   because retirement is close.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.280]   And if we're not careful,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.240]   we can just kind of coast along and drift.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.520]   And if we're not really anchored in Christ,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.480]   we're just kind of waiting for the end to happen,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.800]   we just drift along.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.280]   But there is a period when you don't need to worry so much,
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.400]   is when we die.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.120]   That is the only period in life
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.080]   where you don't have to be so worried about being anchored.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.320]   The temptation that we have is we think,
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.440]   and I can tell you right now that every stage,
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.560]   no matter what stage you're in right now,
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.680]   that you probably agree with everything that I said.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.120]   Most of you are sitting here probably thinking,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.680]   during that stage, like, yeah, it is tough.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680]   It is tough being married.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.920]   It is tough having a kid.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.520]   It is tough going to college.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.920]   I didn't realize the temptation that's there.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.200]   Man, it's tough graduating.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.520]   And all of you, whatever stage in life that you're in,
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.520]   you agree that there is pressure to constantly drift.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.840]   But the temptation is to think
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.360]   that if we change the circumstance,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.880]   if we get to the next stage,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.400]   if we do this and do that,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.960]   that maybe it'll become easier.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.280]   Every stage of life,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   there's a different challenge waiting for you.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.400]   Every stage of your life until we meet Christ.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.800]   The Bible says in 1 Peter 5,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.320]   "Be of sober spirit, be on the alert.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.360]   "Your adversary, the devil,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.460]   "prows around like a roaring lion,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.040]   "seeking someone to devour."
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.240]   He's never at rest.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.160]   The spiritual battle is not just when we're young,
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.320]   is not when we're single,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   is not when we get married,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   is not when we have kids.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.120]   Until the day we die, we are in this spiritual battle.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.760]   And that's why the moment
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.160]   that we are not anchored in Christ, we will drift.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.920]   That's why he says again, 35,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.760]   "For you have need of endurance."
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.240]   And then he says again, verse 36,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.440]   "For you have need of endurance."
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.920]   Now, whenever you see anything in repetition in the Bible,
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.080]   inductive Bible study, what does that mean?
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.600]   Emphasis, right?
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.880]   So if Jesus has something really important to say,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.720]   what does he say?
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.520]   Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.440]   if Peter's about to put his foot in his mouth,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.320]   or maybe after he put his foot in his mouth,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.560]   Jesus say, "Simon, Simon!"
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.120]   In other words, pay attention, right?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.240]   If I wanted people to pay attention,
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.600]   you'll hear my voice go up.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   I don't do that deliberately.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.560]   That's just the way I talk.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.400]   I talk like that even off the pulpit.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.480]   If I get excited, it tends to go up.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.160]   If I really get excited,
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   sometimes you'll see me banging on the pulpit.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.000]   I don't do that deliberately.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.800]   It's not on my notes, bang here.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.480]   It just happens, I get excited.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.640]   Or if I plan it, I might put it up on the screen
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.560]   and say, "This is important,
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.360]   "you need to pay attention to this."
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.760]   Well, obviously, the authors of the Bible,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.240]   the way they communicated is they did it by repetition.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.400]   That's why we know that the holiness of God
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.640]   is extremely important,
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.480]   because it's repeated three times, twice.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.840]   In Revelation, the book of Isaiah,
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.720]   he is holy, holy, holy.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.800]   I say all of this because he says in repetition,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.120]   "You have need of endurance."
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.440]   That's really how he's saying this,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.560]   'cause he repeats it twice, back to back.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.960]   It is not, "You should endure."
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.720]   He tried to endure.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.320]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.920]   You have to endure.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.560]   One of the key elements of our assurance of salvation
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.240]   is perseverance.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   You must persevere, because one of the true evidences
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   of our saving faith is perseverance of our faith.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.040]   Now, let me tell you why he says that,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   because the Bible describes a non-Christian
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.800]   becoming a Christian of his eyes being opened
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.040]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.720]   And you can never go blind again.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.760]   Once you've seen it, once you've genuinely seen
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.480]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.640]   you can't ignore that anymore,
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.760]   even when you are struggling.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.360]   Even if you've drifted for a period.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.280]   You can't just close your eyes and say,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.320]   "I'm gonna pretend like I've never seen that."
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.480]   You can't reclose your eyes.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   Just like if you've tasted something really good,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.160]   and you say, "Oh, I'm gonna act like I never."
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.560]   No, what you've tasted, what you've experienced,
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.120]   you can't reverse that.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.680]   And that's what he means by perseverance of the saints.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.400]   If there was genuine faith, you may drift,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.800]   you may struggle, but you can never shut that door again.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.120]   And that's why he says, you have to persevere.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.560]   You have to persevere, because that's not who you are.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.360]   God had made you a creature of light.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.280]   And if you drift into darkness,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.880]   you will sense that you do not belong.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.200]   And that's why he says, we are not of those
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.000]   who shrink back and are destroyed, that's not us.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   God fundamentally changed our nature.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.040]   We feel alive in the light.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.920]   We feel free in righteousness.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   God had changed the affections of our heart,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.120]   so that what we long for is Christ.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.200]   And so we may be temporarily stumbled,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.240]   we may be temporarily tempted,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.800]   but a true child of Christ will endure.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   And he says, "Yet in a very little while,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.600]   "he who is coming will come and will not delay."
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.320]   Did you notice the repetition in that too?
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.760]   He says three times, he who is coming
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.080]   will come and he will not delay.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.200]   So again, what does it mean when he says it in repetition?
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.840]   Let me read it the way that we should read it, okay?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.760]   For you need to endure, you need to endure,
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.640]   he is coming, he is coming, he is coming.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.800]   That's how it was meant to be read.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   He said we need to endure because this is momentary.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.160]   Whatever temptation, whatever struggles,
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.120]   whatever period of life that you are in,
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.160]   it is temporary, momentary,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.120]   and it is light in comparison
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   to the glory that is coming in Christ.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.480]   So if you've forgotten about that,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.800]   if that's a distant memory,
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   that's the reason why we're struggling.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.240]   That's why our sanctification is so hard,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.600]   because we want something and then we come to church
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.320]   and the pastor keeps telling you, "You can't have it."
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.320]   And that's all sanctification is,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.720]   when you've taken your eyes off the prize.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.880]   Here's a bunch of nice things that you want,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.920]   you can't have it.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.040]   And then you try to forget about it during the week
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.800]   and then you come and you say, "You can't have it again."
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.920]   And all churches, a constant reminder
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.760]   of the things that you love, things that you want,
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.840]   and then me telling you, "You can't have it,
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   "you can't have it."
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.200]   If that's what sanctification is,
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.440]   you're not gonna make it.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.320]   And that's why he says to remember
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.280]   the God who justified us.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.480]   And remember the glory that's coming in this God.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.160]   In a little while.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.120]   How can you even say a little while?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.360]   It's been 2,000 years.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.760]   That preaches well, but what does that mean
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.440]   after 2,000 years?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.520]   Well, time is really relative, right?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.600]   If I say a year to a 50, 60 year old,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.960]   the year's like, "Oh, that's just around the corner."
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.160]   You tell that to a five year old, a year!
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.200]   That's 20% of my life.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.680]   Let me illustrate it this way.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.200]   Imagine if you're on a cruise.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.840]   I don't know if any of you have been on a cruise.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.520]   You're on a cruise and they drop you off
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.840]   at a nice, beautiful island.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.040]   You go on and you're supposed to enjoy yourselves.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.480]   You're supposed to come back by four o'clock
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.560]   because the ship's gonna take off.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.400]   And once they take off,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.800]   they're not gonna be able to come back.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.240]   There's not some train that you can just drive
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.480]   and meet up with.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.080]   Once they're gone, they're gone.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.520]   Once they're gone, they're gone.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.640]   They told you to come at four.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.440]   You ventured out 'cause you wanted to see the hills,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.640]   but then you got a flat.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.240]   And you know they're gonna leave at four.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.880]   And there's no other ride to get back,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.280]   and so you put on the backpack,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.440]   you put on your running shoes,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.840]   and you try to run as fast as you could.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.280]   You're looking at your time,
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   and you're running and running and running.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.280]   And the ship's about to go.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.840]   Four o'clock hits and you're not there.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.560]   They're going through the list and you're not there.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.400]   And so they're waiting and waiting and waiting.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.880]   And then 20 minutes, 30 minutes go by,
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.160]   and they wait as long as they could.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.480]   And at about five o'clock, they say,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.520]   "You know what?
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.560]   "We've waited."
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.440]   And so they shut the thing and then they go.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.800]   And so for the people who are running to get to the boat,
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.360]   they've done everything that they could,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.960]   but they left too early.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.800]   They missed it.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.440]   But the ones who are sitting in the boat,
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.480]   it's like, "Oh my gosh, what is wrong with this boat?
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.920]   "They said four o'clock, but now it's five o'clock.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.200]   "They didn't keep their promise.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.640]   "I told my friends that I was gonna meet them
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.920]   "at the other side, but they left at five."
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.960]   So to one group, they didn't keep their promise
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.720]   and they didn't leave on time.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.520]   And then the other group saying they left too early.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.440]   See, 2 Peter 3.9, it says,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.320]   "The Lord is not slow about his promise,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.280]   "as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.840]   "not wishing for any to perish,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.160]   "but for all to come to repentance."
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.440]   Do you know why this was written?
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.280]   First century.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.160]   About 30 years after the death and resurrection of Christ,
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.040]   the early church, early people say, "Where is he?"
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.880]   Do you know why he was probably saying that?
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.840]   If you know the context of the letter, 1 Peter,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.200]   he's writing during a period
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   of Nero's intense persecution.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.320]   So they wanted relief.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.440]   So they're saying, "Why isn't he coming?"
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.640]   I mean, our friends are being dragged in the Colosseum,
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.400]   being torn apart by lions.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.000]   Why isn't he coming?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   He said he's going to come, he's not going to delay.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.240]   Where is he?
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.600]   They were saying that in the first century.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.400]   It's been 2,000 years since.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.640]   But the reason why he hasn't come yet is because of me,
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   is because of you.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.120]   'Cause he was holding up the boat until we got in.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.840]   So when he says he's not going to delay,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   he's not going to delay any longer than he needs to
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.760]   until the full number of his elect come in.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.680]   And he will not delay any more
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   than until everyone whose name is written
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.840]   in the book of life comes in to the boat.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.080]   But let's see it from another perspective.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.360]   No matter how long we've waited,
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.040]   there's nobody in human history
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.680]   that waited more than 100 years.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.200]   Nobody.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.920]   Unless you were born and you got saved at three months old
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.320]   and then you lived to 100.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.840]   Even if we did wait eagerly,
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.760]   I got saved 37 years ago
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.800]   and I've been waiting 37 years.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.880]   I don't know how many more years to go,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.320]   but at some point I won't be here.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   My waiting will end.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.920]   So no human being has really waited 2,000 years.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   At best, maybe one, I don't know of any, possibly 100.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.360]   But when he says he will not delay,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.880]   this is not an exaggeration.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.600]   But he says we are not of those
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.000]   who shrink back in our disorder.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.120]   That's not who we are.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.400]   If the Holy Spirit is in you,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.920]   you will not feel joy outside of Christ.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.640]   If you are a Christian,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   even in the midst of pursuing the world,
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.280]   there will be an emptiness in your heart,
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.000]   even if you don't recognize it.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Something is off.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.960]   You may not be able to pinpoint it,
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.800]   but something is off.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.520]   Even as you're pursuing, even as you make money,
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.000]   even as your business is thriving, something is off.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.240]   Because God created us to be creatures of light.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.680]   You may stumble in the darkness.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.040]   You may find a little bit of life in the darkness,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.040]   but there is no true light.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.160]   And that's why he doesn't say,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.040]   "Hey, prove yourself to be in the light."
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.160]   He said, "No, we are not.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.240]   "We are not of those who shrink back."
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.600]   So let me conclude with this.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.320]   In 1 John 3, 1 through 3, he says,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.240]   "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us."
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.120]   The word see is translated in other parts of the Bible
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.720]   as translations behold.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.120]   It wasn't just meant to be just kind of casually look.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.960]   It says, "Behold how great a love
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.360]   "the Father has bestowed on us."
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.120]   In other words, think carefully, meditate carefully.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   If you do not see the great gift of salvation
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.000]   that we have in Christ,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.240]   behold what love the Father has bestowed on us
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.960]   that we would be called the children of God.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.640]   You know your sins.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.240]   Even before you came in, we're all nicely dressed.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.000]   Our hair's combed nice, right?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.520]   Most of us.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.200]   And we were presenting our best, but you know your sins.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.240]   You know the lust in your heart.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.720]   You know the bitterness.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.640]   You know the hatred.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.280]   You know how you've drifted.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.040]   When we recognize who he is,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.720]   and we look carefully of what he calls us,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.000]   that's why he says, "Behold, behold,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.240]   "how great a love the Father has bestowed on us
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.360]   "that we would be called the children of God,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.160]   "and such we are."
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:54.360]   Anchor in Christ, and anchor in Christ to come.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.640]   For this reason, the world does not know us
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.720]   because it did not know him.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.280]   Beloved, now we are children of God,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.640]   and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.480]   If you consider carefully,
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   behold what manner of love and who we are in Christ,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.440]   that what we are experiencing now is only temporary
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.400]   and is only partial, and whatever we are beholding,
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.640]   the true ramification of this is coming in Christ.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.360]   We know that when he appears, he will be like him.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.040]   We will be like him because we will see him just as he is,
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.400]   and everyone who has this hope fixed on him
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.360]   purifies himself just as he is pure.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.320]   So as we are wrestling,
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.800]   and I know there's every single one of us,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.080]   no matter what stage in life you are,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.240]   we are all wrestling.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.320]   The temptation to drift is tremendous.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.120]   And if we don't actively, purposefully,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.200]   deliberately, willfully anchor ourselves in Christ,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.240]   we will drift.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.480]   So behold what manner of love that is given to us,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.160]   that we are called the children of God,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.920]   and those who fix their eyes upon him
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.000]   will purify himself and will endure.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.840]   Let's pray.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:16.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued blessing.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.960]   I pray especially for my brothers and sisters
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.520]   who are drifting now,
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.040]   whether here or whether online and at home,
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:32.080]   and we caught ourselves, our hearts being hardened,
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.160]   and the things that are eternal
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.680]   just doesn't seem to matter as much as it used to.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.360]   Help us, Lord God, that your word would strengthen us.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.560]   The Holy Spirit that you've deposited in us
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.480]   that is groaning on our behalf,
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.720]   that we may be united with you for eternity.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.400]   Help us, Lord God, to groan along with the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.080]   Help us, Lord God, to be desperate
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.840]   and to seek you with all our heart.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.040]   Help us, Lord, that our confidence is in what you have done
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.520]   and not in our own righteousness,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.880]   that we would not forsake our confidence.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.240]   Especially, especially now, Father,
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   as the world becomes darker and more and more lost
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.080]   every single week,
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.200]   I pray, Father God, that your spirit would be mightier,
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.760]   that your word would be more powerful,
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.440]   and that your church would do what you called us to do,
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.920]   to be a light in this dark world.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
