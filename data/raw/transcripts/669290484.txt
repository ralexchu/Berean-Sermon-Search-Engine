[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   Good morning, Erins who believed.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.160]   I attended Sunday school, Friday night Bible studies, church outings, any event that was
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160]   church related, I was there.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.080]   Sometimes I attended out of a desire to see my friends and sometimes out of a grumbling
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.240]   obedience to my parents.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   In church, I was a big people pleaser.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.360]   I knew the right answers to questions, knew how to construct a rhetorically sound prayer,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.080]   knew how to feign vulnerability.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.400]   And over time, I began equating my attendance and participation with being a Christian and
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.640]   ultimately my salvation.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.880]   I was baptized before in seventh grade, but not as a believer.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.640]   I got baptized because everybody else was doing it.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000]   I got baptized because I wanted to try crackers and grape juice.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   I had no concept of my hell bound fate, the gospel, and proclaiming Jesus as my savior
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.340]   and my Lord.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.680]   As such, there's no change in my faith or relationship with the Holy God.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.400]   During high school, I grew more in my knowledge about God and the gospel.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.040]   During a Christmas youth gathering sophomore year of high school, God softened my heart
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.080]   and showed me my sin and need for him.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.600]   I remember being so moved, even in tears, but instead of seeking God afterwards, my
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   yearning for God was tainted by the pursuit of emotion.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.920]   Over time, I started to see my sin and need for God in my junior and senior year and was
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.400]   so thankful that Jesus died for my sins.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.640]   I was moved to emotion, but never to lay down my life.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.600]   I started to lead worship for the youth group, went to prayer meetings, led some Bible studies.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.120]   Ironically, when leading these Bible studies, I did not study the Bible on my own, but watched
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.000]   YouTube sermons on the same passage and regurgitated whatever the pastor said.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.760]   Unknowingly, my faith was superficial, based on spiritual highs, sure lived emotions, and
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.680]   convictions of other Christians.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.200]   I became familiar with Jesus as savior, but disregarded his lordship.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.240]   I thought I placed Jesus as lord over my life, but in reality, I surrendered when it was
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.200]   convenient to surrender, I obeyed when it was easy to obey.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.360]   I found myself justifying my decision to choose myself and my idols with moments when I surrendered
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.040]   in the past.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.200]   I was trying to patch up my insecurities and compensate my lack of a genuine faith with
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.680]   external works.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.320]   I wanted to prove to others, to myself, and to God that I was mature in my faith, that
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.480]   I deserved salvation.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.240]   When I came to Berean this past August, Pastor Nate talked about Matthew 7, 22 to 23.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800]   "Lord, Lord, do we not prophesy in your name and in your name cast out demons and in your
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.080]   name perform many miracles?"
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   And the Lord says, "I never knew you.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.120]   Depart from me."
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.480]   To me, the scariest two verses in the Bible.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.920]   I was always aware of this passage, but because of my pride, I overlooked it, thinking it
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.440]   was reserved for hypocrites, people who acted a certain way at church, but a different way
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   the rest of the week.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.000]   I didn't think it was talking about me, someone who led worship, someone who went on mission
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.680]   trips, someone who helped with VBS, or someone who was doing a Bible in a year reading plan.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   But it was.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.760]   God cut my heart with his word and showed the prideful ground I stood on.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560]   During the past few months, I've continually wrestled and reflected on my Christian life.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.920]   I feared going to hell and was ashamed because everything I did in the past, the worship,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.320]   the mission trips, the blemish service, robbed God of his glory, and was polluted by selfish
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   motives.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.080]   The chasm between a sinful man and a holy God became uncomfortably clear to me.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.760]   Ephesians 2 says, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins."
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.360]   And Romans 3.23 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.520]   These verses rang in my head as I wrestled.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.440]   However, at the same time God revealed his holiness in my sinfulness, God illuminated
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.780]   his son Jesus in what he did.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680]   The mercy and grace of God through Jesus was the only way I could be redeemed.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.720]   Only Jesus could bridge the impossible divide between man and God.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.600]   First Peter 1.18-19 says, "Knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.560]   silver or gold from your futile way of life, inherited from your forefathers, but with
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.840]   precious blood as of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.400]   It is the work of Jesus and his purchase with his blood that washes my sins.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   And through his resurrection, I'm alive again with a life that is not my own.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.160]   Jesus bought my life and is rightfully Lord of it.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   I'm still learning to let go of certain areas of my life to and for Christ and his kingdom,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.840]   but I'm confident in the cross.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.480]   Not in my own merit or resolve, but solely in the ultimate display of unceasing and undeserved
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   love in Christ's crucifixion.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   Thank you.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   [applause]
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.980]   [end]
