[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   I'm going to be reading both verses, verse 1 and 2.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.160]   Our focus is going to be on verse 2.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.040]   "I appeal to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.320]   as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.000]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.760]   Let's pray.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.640]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.760]   We pray that our minds may truly be renewed each time we are exposed to your word, both
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.560]   in corporate worship and in private.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.160]   And day to day, Father God, as we are being renewed and transformed, that we may become
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.600]   more and more like the image of Christ in all that we are.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800]   We pray that you would bless this morning, that our worship may be internal, expressed
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.320]   externally.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.000]   We pray, Father God, that you would cause us to grow more and more to worship you in
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.920]   spirit and in truth.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.480]   So we ask, Lord, your Holy Spirit would lead and guide in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.580]   Amen.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.200]   Just as a quick review, last week we looked at verse 1 and Paul again is transitioning
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.840]   from justification to sanctification and how our response, considering the mercies
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.640]   of God, considering 11 chapters of exposition detailed about God's mercies and what he has
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.280]   done, what should that look like in the life of a believer other than just acknowledging
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.520]   that we believe in justification?
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.040]   Sanctification is not part two of our salvation.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.720]   Sanctification is the other side of the same thing.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.900]   So you can't be justified and not be sanctified.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.160]   You can't say, "I've been justified, but I'm not committed to sanctification."
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.400]   An individual who has been justified, it is only logical that they are moving on toward
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.440]   sanctification.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   So last week we looked at four aspects of sanctification as an introduction.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.240]   Sanctification requires our commitment where Paul urges them to offer their body as a living
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   sacrifice.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   So the first thing that we talked about is, are we committed to sanctification or is that
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.800]   something that we're just allowing passively to happen in our life?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   That's number one.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760]   Secondly, sanctification is motivated and empowered by God's grace.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   And even sanctification, even though it requires our commitment, we recognize the internal
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.060]   work that God is doing inside of us that is being expressed externally.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.680]   So it is being motivated and empowered by the grace of God.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.420]   Third, sanctification is ultimately an act of worship.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.160]   That our desire to be sanctified is not simply to be a better person, but that it is God's
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560]   giving us an avenue for us to worship God.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.360]   So not just Sunday worship, but whether we are cleaning up the trash can, giving, every
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.320]   aspect of our life, both private and publicly, ultimately it is an act of worship to God.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.600]   Fourthly, sanctification is a logical, reasonable response of worship to God for his mercies.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.480]   Meaning that if you truly believe that you've been saved by the grace of God, that only
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.760]   logical response to that is to live in obedience to God's word.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.160]   That you can't believe in justification and not have any application of sanctification.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.760]   So those are the four things that we've reviewed today.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.880]   And then second, in verse 2, Paul is going to go dive a little bit deeper, a little bit
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.520]   more applicational.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.320]   What does that look like in the life of a believer?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.560]   So the first thing that he says in application, knowing that these are the basis of understanding
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.520]   of sanctification, he says, "Do not conform to this world."
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.720]   Or in the NIV it says, "Do not conform to the pattern of this world."
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.520]   I shared with you last week, as we were wrapping up, and I think my voice did carry enough
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.620]   where I think most of you guys heard it, but when I got that email from the Indian pastors
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.040]   that persecution is being ramped up.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.300]   And the reason why the email that I got last week is different from the previous emails
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.080]   that I shared with you was that typically the persecution was just a reaction.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.260]   Whether the pastors were preaching the gospel and then somebody in the neighborhood didn't
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.800]   like it and threw rocks at them and chased them out of the village.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.680]   But the persecution that they experienced this week was organized by the village leader.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so the village leader basically demanded all the village members to come and worship
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.560]   this idol.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.020]   And so the Christians in that village who refused to go, the village leaders organized
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.800]   a mob to go and drag them out of their house and beat them outside and inside their home.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.440]   And that's why it was much more serious than the other ones that we reported to you.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.960]   And so they've asked us to pray.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.720]   The main leader, Pastor Matthew, some of you guys who've been to India with us, he is trying
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.200]   to talk to the village leaders to try to calm them down, to allow the Christians to be in
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.600]   the villages in a peaceful manner.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.760]   We haven't heard back from them, but I think it is, again, it is something that we need
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.720]   to actively pray for.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.400]   And we'll, again, give you a heads up if I get more information about that.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.960]   One of the benefits, if you want to call it a benefit, of being in a situation where persecution
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.120]   is clear is that the world and the church, there is a clear line where you stand.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   And so you know who the Christians are because to be a Christian means that you're going
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.200]   to be shunned from the world.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.960]   And you know exactly, if you're not going to follow Christ, you know exactly where you
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.920]   stand because you end up being forced to serve idols and participate in other things.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   But the danger that you and I have living in the culture that you and I live in is that
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.800]   that line is not clear.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.080]   Where does a Christian stand?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.880]   Other than the fact that we attend church, and you know as well as I do, attending church
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.640]   doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.680]   You can be a church all your life and still not a Christian, and I think you know that.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.480]   So the danger that you and I live in is growing up in a culture where Christianity is embedded,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.400]   and I'm not talking about the general population.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.880]   I'm talking about the church, within the church, that it is difficult to distinguish whether
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.920]   you are worldly or whether you are a follower of Christ because that line is not clear.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.880]   Even the people who say that they are followers of Christ, there is no clear distinction outside
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.680]   of verbally saying, "I am a Christian.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   I go to church.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.000]   I confess Jesus Christ."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.920]   If you didn't say that, would the people in your lives be able to discern that your values
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   are different, that you believe in heaven and hell, you believe that the Son of God
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.240]   came and died for you, and so therefore your citizenship is not here?
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.760]   Will the non-Christians in your life be able to discern that?
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   So the challenge that you and I live in is that when the scripture says, "Do not conform
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:54.240]   to this world," what does that mean when even within the church it's hard for us to discern
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.160]   worldliness and non-worldliness?
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.080]   So it sounds good, but in application we don't know how to apply this because there is no
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:09.280]   distinction or it's very difficult to distinguish between worldliness and followers of Christ.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.920]   See, the first thing that he tells us in sanctification is to recognize not to live in the pattern
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.720]   of this world.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.880]   The scripture tells us in 2 Corinthians 4.4 that the God of this age is Satan, and he
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.160]   blinded the mind of the unbelievers so that they do not see the glory of the gospel of
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Jesus Christ.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.760]   So it's clear that the world that you and I live in is not neutral.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   It is under the dominion and power of Satan himself.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.240]   First John 5.19, "We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.320]   of the evil one."
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   So when he's talking about, "Do not follow the pattern of this world," he's not simply
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.600]   talking about the way you dress, the way you think.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   He's talking about everything that is within the world who is under the dominion of Satan,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.920]   that the first act is that he delivered us from that.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   So now he calls us to come out.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.120]   Colossians 1.13-14, "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.100]   from the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.020]   So typically when we think of redemption, we only focus our attention on redemption
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.740]   on the aspect of our inner sin.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.140]   He redeemed us from our sins.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.000]   He redeemed us from hell.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.540]   And so now we are saved.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.640]   But the idea of redemption in the scripture goes way beyond just your inner sin.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.540]   The redemption focuses not just on the inner sin, but on the outer world.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.780]   That the scripture says, "Not only are we condemned, but the world in itself is under
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.980]   condemnation."
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.980]   So when he calls us to not to be a part of the pattern of this world, that's also a part
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.940]   of redemption.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.840]   He's redeeming us from the very things that caused us to be corrupt.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:08.440]   So the world that he is talking about here functions as an instrument of Satan to promote
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.720]   his goals.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:17.660]   So when we think about what is right and wrong, or sin or not sin, we usually think of extremes,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.140]   lying, killing, pornography.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.460]   And so those clearly are sinful.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.480]   And then whatever is not labeled sin, clearly not labeled sin, we think, "Well, those things
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.740]   are neutral."
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:38.180]   The way that the Bible describes worldliness is anything that Satan uses to distract you
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:45.740]   or to even prevent you from passionately serving God is under Satanic rule.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:59.340]   Satan uses thoughts, ideas, trends, philosophies, religion, politics, culture, fashion, entertainment,
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.060]   hopes, economy, marketing, and so on.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.620]   All that is under his dominion, all that is in our culture in this world is under his
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.980]   dominion.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.540]   And so the first thing that he tells us is he saved us from the penalty of our sins,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.340]   but he also saves us.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.860]   The process of sanctification is to now begin to slowly remove us from the things that ultimately
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.020]   corrupts us.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.420]   There's a reason why the book of Hebrews says when Jesus was crucified, where was he crucified?
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.180]   On a tree outside the gate, right?
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.180]   Outside.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.780]   And he says, "Therefore, since Christ was crucified outside, that we ought to go to
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:48.860]   him who went outside," meaning he's calling us away from the world to join him, to separate
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.340]   ourselves from the world.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.280]   He commands us not to conform.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.420]   The word conform literally means to be stamped out, right?
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.420]   To be stamped out, to start to look like, act like, and sound like the world.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.500]   Let me give you an example.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.260]   I took this water out this morning from the fridge, and my guess is this is probably about
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.380]   30 or 40 degrees when I took it out.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.060]   And it's been sitting out here, and now the temperature obviously isn't the same.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.420]   Now how many of you want to guess what temperature this is now?
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.900]   Are you educated folks?
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.780]   Room temperature, yes, right?
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.140]   Room temperature.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.420]   So I think the temperature in this room is probably about 70 degrees, so this is probably
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.680]   about 70 degrees.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.220]   So when the Bible talks about being lukewarm, lukewarm is basically adjusting to whatever
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.380]   temperature is around you.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.340]   When we talk about not conforming to the world, your temptation, your peer pressure is not
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.580]   coming from Kenya.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.420]   It's not happening from Middle East.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.280]   Whatever is trendy over there, you may read about it, but that's not where the rubber
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.220]   meets the road.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.800]   Your temptation is not coming from ultimately Hollywood.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.420]   You may watch TV and may have some temptation, but where the rubber meets the road is near
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.420]   you.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.700]   Whatever room that you are a part of is where the temptation is coming from.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.140]   So your temptation to conform is very unique to where you are.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:29.420]   So if you happen to be in whatever company that you're working, your coworkers, whatever
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.340]   culture is that you're a part of, if you happen to be a school teacher, whatever pressure
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:39.300]   that you are under as a school teacher and under the CTA or whatever it is that you're
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.740]   a part of, your temptation is coming from that area.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.300]   It's to adjust to room temperature and not to stand out.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.380]   Now that could happen even within the church because this is where the rubber meets the
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.860]   road.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.600]   This is where you feel the pressure to conform.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:09.220]   So if you are in a habit of conforming, you can conform in a Christian culture and still
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.160]   just living worldly.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.300]   So if you happen to go to a church where the Bible is emphasized, you end up emphasizing
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.300]   the Bible.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.580]   If you happen to go to a church where there's a lot of prayer, you end up praying more.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.940]   Do more evangelizing, you end up evangelizing.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.460]   And so your Christian life goes up and down based upon who you are surrounded by.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.860]   So if you happen to be surrounded by passionate Christians, you end up becoming passionate.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.560]   So if you happen to be surrounded by people who are kind of living loosely, that's what
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.980]   you become.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.860]   And so you're constantly looking for your surrounding to change so that you can be what?
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.020]   So you can conform.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:50.580]   So the danger of living that way is that your, whatever temperature you are, is dependent
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.060]   upon whatever room you're in.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.100]   So when the scripture talks about not to conform, he's talking about an inner temperature inside
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.580]   of us that's being transformed.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.260]   It's completely different.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.980]   That it is not the outside temperature changing us, but it's the inside temperature that is
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.560]   affecting us in the way that we worship God.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.860]   So worldliness is going to look very different based upon who you are.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.620]   Worldliness doesn't look the same way.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.260]   Worldliness in some of us may not be expressed financially.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.620]   It may not be expressed in the way that what you watch.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.820]   A lot of times worldliness is happening within your own heart.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.100]   So when he says do not conform to the pattern of this world, it is a constant desire to
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.100]   fit in.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.620]   It is a constant desire to be like what's around you.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.020]   And the scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear that you cannot love God and love the
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.540]   world at the same time.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:56.140]   First of all, it says the love of the world and love of God cannot coexist in 1 John 2,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.140]   15-17.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.580]   "Do not love the world or the things of the world.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.100]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.820]   For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.900]   the pride and possession is not from the Father, but is from the world.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.700]   And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.060]   abides forever."
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.420]   If you love the world, you cannot love God.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.860]   Now it seems like, well that's pretty extreme.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.260]   You can't have both.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.460]   But again in James 4, 4-5, James reiterates the same thing, maybe even stronger.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.980]   He says, "You adulterous people, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.980]   with God?
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.980]   Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.420]   Or do you suppose it is no purpose that Scripture says that he yearns jealousy over the spirit
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.300]   that he made to dwell in us?"
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.060]   You know what those both passages assume before he even states that?
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:00.900]   There is an assumption that you have made an allegiance to God already.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:07.340]   There is an assumption that the friendship with God, your connection with God, is valuable
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340]   to you.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.260]   And so he speaks in saying, you can't say that you love God and love the world at the
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.980]   same time.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.860]   But if there's never been a commitment, you don't have any affection for God.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.800]   And he says, if you have affection for the world, you can't have affection for God.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:29.560]   If affection for God is not at the core of who you are, so what?
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.200]   What do you lose?
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.540]   There is no consequence for being worldly.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.380]   There's no consequence for chasing the world because you don't see any difference.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.020]   If there is no distinction, if your life is constantly live on the border of the world
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:50.780]   and the church, being worldly is here and being godly is here.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.220]   And there's not much difference.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:58.620]   So if you're living your life constantly in the gray, you know what gray is?
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.220]   And my point is not to get into controversy of what gray is.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:08.580]   Gray is something that can't be clearly identified as wrong, but clearly it is not right.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.900]   You can't say it's white because clearly it's not white.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.660]   And you can't say it's black.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.560]   And so because you can't say it's black, it's okay.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.020]   So you live constantly in a place in life where godliness is here and you're only a
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.500]   step away from the world.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:32.820]   And so when the scripture warns that you can't love God and love the world at the same time,
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:39.420]   you may not say it, but in your mind, "Well, I'm doing it."
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.180]   Only way that you see the difference is if your life, if there is an affection for Christ,
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.280]   that being worldly, you can see the clear delineation.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   You can't.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.920]   And loving the world has direct effect in your affection and love for Christ.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.440]   Where everything is evaluated based upon, "Is this drawing me closer to God or further
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.640]   from God?"
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.560]   And he clearly says you can't have both.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.000]   Conformity, second, with the world is direct conflict to the nature of God.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.240]   First Peter 1, 14-15, "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passion of your
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.120]   former ignorance.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.520]   But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conducts, since it is
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.560]   written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.000]   He said the second reason why God wants us to separate from the world is because God
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   is holy.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.900]   And the word holy is not, it doesn't just mean that it's morally perfect, it also means
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.400]   to be separate.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.720]   Separate from all that corrupts.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.600]   So if the Holy Spirit is dwelling in us and is actively working in us, there is a constant
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.680]   discomfort in a Christian who is constantly living in the pattern of this world.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.400]   Because the Holy Spirit will not be comfortable.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.520]   I mean, think about how detestable sin is in God's eyes that the book of Revelation
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.320]   looks like the book of Revelation.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.460]   Revelation basically is a picture of what God thinks of sin.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:15.160]   And what he does to the world is, again, it is a painting, it is a picture of God making
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.240]   an impression on us, on Christians, on what will happen to all that is unclean in the
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.960]   sight of God at the end when his wrath is no longer withheld and he unleashes judgment
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   that the world deserves.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:35.440]   So the book of Revelation basically is a picture of what God sees in the world.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:42.680]   Because he is holy, we cannot exist in unholiness with the Holy God dwelling inside of us at
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   the same time.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.240]   It is not possible.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.880]   Thirdly, those who are of God will not be accepted by those of the world.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.800]   If you really are of God, and because God is holy and the world is unholy, there's
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:03.040]   no way a Christian could be comfortable in the world and think that he is having both.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.800]   In John 15, 19, "If you are of the world, the world would love you as its own.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.200]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.240]   world hates you."
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   Think about the trouble that we have gotten ourselves into in our generation where we're
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.600]   trying so hard to make the world comfortable inside the church.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.880]   Where Christians, whether inside or outside, are trying so hard to be accepted by the world.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.280]   Where the scripture clearly says, because they did not recognize him.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.640]   And if we follow the pattern of Christ, they said they will reject us as they rejected
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   Christ.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.440]   Again in John 17, 14, he says, "I have given them your word and the world has hated them
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.240]   because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world."
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.560]   The world is not neutral to us.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.280]   And we are not neutral to the world.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.080]   And there's a reason why the scripture tells us that we are in a spiritual battle.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.520]   That we have an enemy who is like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.760]   We are not on friendly terms with the world.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.920]   And it is when we try to make an effort that somehow we're going to be righteous and holy
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.580]   and we're going to be cool in the eyes of the world at the same time, is a direct contradiction
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.440]   to what the world warns us of.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   Again in 1 John 4, 4-6, it says, "Little children, you are from God and have overcome
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   them.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.440]   For he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.740]   They are from the world, therefore they speak from the world and the world listens to them."
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   We are from God.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.400]   Whoever knows God listens to us.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.560]   Whoever is not from God does not listen to us.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.100]   By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:51.320]   That ultimately, those who will listen to God are those whom God is reaching.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.680]   The Holy Spirit is already working in them.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:00.180]   But fourth and finally, our sanctification is God's will for us.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.560]   Let me ask you a rhetorical question.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.840]   How many of you recently have prayed for better health?
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.240]   It's rhetorical so don't raise your hand.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.880]   How many of you have recently prayed to get into a certain school?
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.480]   How many of you have recently prayed so that you can get a particular job?
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   How many of you have prayed for your children so that they will be healthy and that certain
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.520]   paths will open up for them?
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.240]   How many of you prayed for your parents for better marriages?
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.680]   We have all kinds of things that we pray for seeking the Lord's will.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.880]   The Lord never made those things clear.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.060]   The Lord never spelled out that he wants you to be healthy all the time.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.200]   The Lord never spells out in the scripture that he wants you to be wealthy all the time.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.920]   He didn't say that if you believe in Jesus that all of you are going to get the best
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.440]   jobs, all of you are going to go to the right school, that your marriage is going to be
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   okay.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.000]   The Bible never promises that.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:06.480]   And yet the content of our prayer is wanting my will be done on earth and in heaven.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.520]   And we're reversing this order.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.760]   But what the scripture makes absolutely crystal clear about his will, 1 Thessalonians 4, 3,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:22.000]   4, this is the will of God, your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.520]   And he gives a list of things that we are to abstain from.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.960]   The things, so much of the content of our prayer is so ambiguous because we're not even
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.560]   sure if that's what God desires for us.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.120]   And so much of our frustration is coming because we're trying to bend him to our will.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.320]   And yet when the scripture says, no, God's will is that we are sanctified, that we separate
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   from this world and we kind of ignore that.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.180]   Yes, God wants this, but I want this.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.360]   How much of our frustration is because not because God is not answering us, but because
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   we are not praying according to his will.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.800]   Because the scripture clearly says, if you abide in me, my words abide in you, then ask
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   whatever you wish it shall be done for you.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.880]   Are you certain the things that you are crying out to God for is God's will?
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.920]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:20.560]   But what we know for a fact that this is universal truth in Christianity is that God's will is
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:29.840]   for us to be sanctified, to separate, to not be conformed to the pattern of this world.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.800]   Not only are we commanded not to be part of this world, he says, he gives us practical
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:44.120]   commands to not to be conformed, but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.760]   Conformity doesn't require work.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.560]   Conformity, all you have to do is take wherever you are, place it wherever you are, and adjust
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.920]   to wherever you are.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.120]   So if you happen to be one of those people, you're a certain way at church, you're a certain
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.940]   way at home, you're a certain way at work, you're a certain way when people watch you.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:08.480]   So whatever expectations, whatever surrounding, you just adjust.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.680]   So you may be godly at church and ungodly at work.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   You're godly in public, but ungodly in private.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.040]   So it doesn't take a lot of work to conform.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.880]   You just need to let yourself be.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.940]   But then he goes beyond that and he says, but to be transformed.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.880]   The word for transform is metamorpho, and that's where we get the word for butterflies,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   you know, metamorphosis.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.440]   It completely becomes a completely different creature.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.160]   And that's how the scripture describes us, 2 Corinthians 5.17, "Therefore, if anyone
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.800]   is in Christ, he is a new creation."
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.760]   He doesn't say he is a better creation.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.160]   He doesn't say that he didn't read his Bible, now he's reading his Bible.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.560]   He says he's completely new.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.440]   God and sin can never dwell together.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.600]   And that's why he had to cover our sins by the blood of Christ in order for the Holy
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.200]   Spirit to make an indwelling in us.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:04.600]   There will never be a time where the Holy Spirit would be okay with us living in sin.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.800]   And so he had to make us a new creation in order to make a dwelling in us.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.760]   He said, "The old has passed away, behold, the new has come."
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.480]   So here's the difference.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.320]   Here's what sanctification is.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.000]   We have a lot of marriages at church, and so every ceremony we say what God has put
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.540]   together and no man separates.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   So two becoming one.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.140]   So any of you who've been married know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:37.880]   You become one legally and spiritually and socially you become one.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.800]   But have you actually become one?
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   No.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   Right?
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.000]   So the rest of our marriages, the rest of our lives, we are working to become one.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.960]   We're working to become one in finances.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.080]   We're working to become one in sharing space.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.760]   We're working to become one in even the food that we eat, right?
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   Because you're not going to have two separate meals every day.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.240]   Before you got married, whatever you wanted, you had.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.600]   And then now you kind of have to think, like, what do we want?
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.320]   And you have vacation, you're like, "Oh, I wanted to do this."
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.920]   And you gather a bunch of friends who wanted to do this, and you hung out with them.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.600]   But once you get married, it's what do we want?
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.400]   So the rest of our marriage, basically you're working to become one.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.060]   What God has declared, you're actually beginning to live out.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.840]   So the scripture, when it says, "Live up to the calling that you have received," basically
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.320]   calling us to sanctification is God says, "You have been united with Christ legally.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.960]   Now live like it."
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.540]   Live to become one.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.260]   Not only to say, "Oh, I've been united in justification," but now we're learning to
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.260]   think like Christ.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.400]   We're learning to be Christ in every situation.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.900]   That's what sanctification is.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:53.160]   Is that He calls us to be utterly transformed.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.580]   You know what's interesting is the word for transformation is metamorpho.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.120]   And He says, "Well, how do you metamorpho?
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   How do you change?"
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.600]   He says, "By the renewing of your mind."
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.760]   By the changing of your mind.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   You know what's interesting?
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.960]   The word for repentance is metanoia.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.820]   So transformation, okay?
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:18.240]   Transformation is metamorpho, but repentance literally means to change your mind.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.120]   So how did we become new creation?
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.600]   We repented.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.240]   We heard the gospel, recognized our sin, and we repented.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   Our minds got changed.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.360]   So it doesn't simply mean, "Oh, okay.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   I heard it.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   Now I believe it.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   My mind is changed."
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.720]   But your mind changing basically means that basically because you repented, your life
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.480]   began to follow.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.620]   That's what we mean by the biblical meaning of repentance.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:52.320]   So when He says to metamorpho by metanoia, the changing of our mind by renewing of our
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   mind.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:00.900]   So we are justified by metanoia and we are being sanctified by metanoia, meaning constant
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   repentance.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:09.220]   As we begin to recognize that there are certain patterns in me that is not according to Scripture,
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:16.820]   according to a person who is now a child of God, we continually repent.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.020]   Not only of the external, but in particular the internal.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.460]   When was the last time did you repent about pride?
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:33.940]   If you struggle with purity, and I'm sure you feel the pressure of the purity of pornography,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:38.140]   whatever it is that you may be struggling with, and we feel this urge to repent and
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:44.300]   we repent, we confess our sins, but how often do we repent of the inner sins?
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.700]   And sometimes the inner sins is much uglier.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:55.220]   Sin of pride, sin of coveting, sin of bitterness, sin of divisiveness, sin of slander, whatever
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:02.540]   it may be, that the sin that is dwelling within us, that sometimes manifests in our speech,
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.980]   is just as ugly or sometimes more ugly than oftentimes the external sins that we commit.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:13.100]   And again, we're not nullifying the external sins, but how often does that change happen
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:18.300]   within that nobody may know of, but you know it.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.740]   See, what sanctification happens when we renew our mind is constant when we recognize it
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.740]   to repent.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.300]   That's why the psalmist says, "Search me and know me, see if there's any hurtful ways in
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.900]   me."
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.360]   Not search them and know them, see if there's any hurtful ways in them, but search me.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.860]   What is happening inside of me?
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:41.300]   What is a pattern of the world that is in me that needs to be renewed?
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:47.100]   Ephesians 4, 22-24, "To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.980]   and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds."
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:57.540]   In other words, a call to repentance and to put on the new self created after the likeness
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.380]   of God in the true righteousness and holiness.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.200]   Again Colossians 3, 9, "Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.460]   old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which being renewed in the knowledge
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.420]   after the image of its creator."
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.840]   So as we begin to understand God, as we begin to know His holiness and how He thinks of
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:25.340]   sin and His mercy and grace, and when we think about the totality in view of His mercy, it
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.060]   brings us to repentance, transformation, and it makes us new creatures of worship.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:36.460]   Again, Philippians 2, 1-5, "So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort of
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.540]   love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy."
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.500]   All of these are descriptions of any Christian.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.740]   This is not special Christians who have some sort of comfort of love that other Christians
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.740]   did not experience.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.880]   He's not describing participation in the Spirit where some have the Spirit and some don't.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.800]   This is a description of every Christian.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.380]   So in other words, if you've been justified in your sins, "Complete my joy by being of
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.380]   [what?]
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.380]   same mind."
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.060]   And which mind is he referring to?
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.660]   Verse 5, "Have the mind of Christ."
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.040]   Having the mind of Christ.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:21.200]   So sanctification begins by union with Christ, but an ongoing spiritual growth is learning
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.860]   to become like Christ in every way.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:31.180]   Let me explain that, like how sanctification practically happens.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:39.220]   Again, it's no secret that when I go to China, I don't get to eat much unless I go to Western
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.220]   food.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.220]   I just don't eat Chinese food.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.140]   And the reason is because I don't like Chinese food, as I mentioned to you guys before.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.540]   In fact, I love Chinese food.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.060]   Chinese food was one of my favorite food before I went to China.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.820]   And so the taste is very familiar.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.540]   And it is not, I know some of you guys are already saying like, "Oh, that's not Chinese
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.540]   food.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.340]   That's Korean Chinese food."
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.340]   That's what I mean.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.340]   Okay?
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.080]   So that's what I'm referring to, the Korean Chinese food to mean Korean in Chinese.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.220]   So when I went to China, I've experienced so much dirt.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.860]   Like I found roly-polies, pieces of sponges.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.460]   I've gone to like fancy dumpling restaurants, and the guy was making dumpling with his hand,
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.980]   you know, did number two and didn't wash his hand and kept making dumpling.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.500]   And I just had so many of these stories of years coming in and out of China.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.020]   And I'm not saying everywhere is like that.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   It's just I've experienced enough of it.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.580]   So when I'm in China and I smell Chinese food, it doesn't make me hungry.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.140]   And this is in particular in China, just because of some of those things that I've experienced.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.260]   So I just lose my appetite.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.900]   I smell it here, and I'm hungry.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.740]   I smell it over there, and immediately I don't want to eat that.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   Right?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.400]   Nothing has changed except my perception.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.180]   My perception.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:59.900]   Now the reason why I share that with you is because if the world that you are living in
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:08.020]   after you became a Christian is still the same as it was before you became a Christian,
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.000]   it will be impossible for you to run from that.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.700]   Because the smell of the world, the flavor of the world, the attraction of the world
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.100]   is causing you to be consumed to want it, and you're covering it constantly.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.960]   And so when you come to church and the church says, "Do not conform to the world," all you
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.860]   hear is, "You can't have fun and be a Christian at the same time."
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.380]   All the other people in the world can just live their life and do whatever they want,
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.540]   but you come to church and all you do is bring guilt trip.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.900]   That's what you would be hearing.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.460]   And so how do we fight that?
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.460]   You're a legalist.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.740]   That's not what God wants from us.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.680]   God wants us to be free.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.900]   And so we nullify holiness, and we nullify sanctification, because sanctification to
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.580]   us is preventing us from having fun.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.640]   So why can't we love the church and love the world at the same time, even though the scripture
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.180]   clearly says you cannot?
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.300]   And that's why he's saying not to be conformed, but be transformed by the renewing of our
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   mind.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:12.860]   If we do not see sin the way God sees sin, the world will be constantly a place that
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.100]   we covet.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.660]   Instead of coveting people who are in love with God and pursuing Him, we covet missionaries
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.660]   sharing the gospel, we covet the world.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.340]   We covet people who have better jobs than us.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.620]   We covet people who live in nicer houses than us.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.980]   We covet people who have a better income than us.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.780]   And so as long as we are coveting that, transformation never takes place.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.620]   It is a constant struggle that we wrestle with over and over again, because our appetite
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.300]   has never changed.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:49.880]   In order for us to overcome our temptation, that which is tempting us has to be renewed
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.860]   in our mind.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.460]   And that's where the study of the Word of God – and again, you can study the Word
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.460]   of God and have all the knowledge, and your appetite never changed, because you never
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.620]   engaged in it.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.540]   That's the difference between somebody who's learning the language from a book versus somebody
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.060]   who's actually in the culture.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   It's night and day.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.540]   So if you ever try to learn a language just from reading books, you can know the words,
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:19.340]   but all the words that you know is just a direct translation from what you know in English.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.260]   But if you really want to know the language, you have to be immersed in that culture, because
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.820]   there's a lot of cultural words.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.900]   You kind of have to be there and smell and experience that culture in order to know what
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.900]   that means.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.060]   So there's a night and day difference between somebody who learned the language within the
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.260]   culture versus somebody who learned the language from outside the culture.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.140]   You can still learn the language, but it's just not the same.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.380]   So when the Bible talks about renewing our mind, He's not simply talking about, "Oh,
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.020]   you memorize Scripture, you know the Bible, and you did a lot of Bible study, a lot of
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:58.300]   theology, and you have never immersed yourself in the things of God."
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.020]   Lordship was just something that you talked about but never practiced.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.120]   So you can verbalize sanctification.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   You can verbalize how the world is, but it is not the pattern of your life.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.820]   Our natural inclination is we run toward things that make us happy.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.780]   And you can see when you are not under pressure, when there is no accountability and nobody's
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.740]   watching you, what you run to.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.060]   What you run to, what pleases you to do, is what is drawing you.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.300]   That's what you covet.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.860]   But what God desires in transformation is not just conformity and just doing the right
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.460]   thing because it just happens that the room that you are in is watching you and out of
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.780]   peer pressure, you're conforming.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:49.900]   But what God desires is transformation where real worship is happening from within, expressed
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.180]   outwardly.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:57.420]   And so again, let me give you another example, a positive example.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:03.000]   You know, every Thanksgiving, my father passed away eight years ago around Thanksgiving.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.740]   So every Thanksgiving, what we do is we pack our bags and have lunch and we take it to
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.660]   the cemetery, Rose Hill.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.660]   And so some of you guys who have loved ones, like somebody really close to you who passed
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.340]   away, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.220]   Before my father passed away, whenever you talk about cemetery, I mean you think of dead
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.220]   bodies.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.700]   It's not a place you're going to hang out.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.100]   Like, what are you doing Saturday?
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.460]   I'm going to go to the cemetery and hang out.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.260]   That's weird, right?
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.060]   But after you have somebody, and I've had cousins and people that I knew from church
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.460]   who passed away before, but obviously this is the closest person that I know passed away
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.040]   is my father.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.380]   And so after he passed away, the cemetery completely became different.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.100]   So I remember the very first Christmas that we went to go visit my dad's grave, it's probably
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.620]   one of the most festive places I've been to.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.940]   It was weird because it transformed overnight.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:04.400]   I went there and there was Christmas trees set up by the graves.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.700]   So families and children, grandparents, and you could tell who passed away because sometimes
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.020]   you'll see moms with small children around the grave and maybe the father passed away.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.780]   And you could see all of that.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.220]   And we thought, well, we're going to go Christmas.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.020]   Who's going to be at the grave at the Christmas?
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.440]   It was packed.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.240]   And Thanksgiving is no different.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.680]   Our family chose to take it another level because we actually have a picnic over there.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.440]   We make kimbap and tteokbokki and all that.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   We just eat.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.140]   It's a little bit weird, but we do that every Thanksgiving.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.440]   And then we go and have the dinner at one of our homes.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.280]   What changed?
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:43.080]   The way that I view the cemetery now is different because now when I go there, I don't see this
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.040]   is where dead bodies are.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.720]   I see these are someone's dads, somebody's moms, husband, children.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.080]   These are loved ones who are buried here.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.280]   So it doesn't seem as strange as it was before.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.300]   The only thing that changed was my perspective.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.400]   My perspective changed.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.640]   And so church was a place to me before I became a Christian, I hated.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.880]   Because all I knew about the church was what I saw growing up.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.160]   I saw the drama.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.280]   I saw my parents talking in the front seat.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.320]   And I heard everything that they thought, all the stuff that was happening at church.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.760]   And I said, why do these people attend church?
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.920]   If they hate each other, they can't stand each other.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   Why are they at church?
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.960]   And that's all I saw.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.160]   And then now I'm here, I'm a third generation pastor doing things I hated.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.720]   I said, turn 18, I'm going to run from the church because I didn't see it.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.000]   All I saw was from a non-Christian's perspective.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.640]   And even after I became a Christian, it took a lot of sanctification for me to see the
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.640]   church through his eyes.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:53.360]   For God said, I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.680]   And I began to understand how much he loves his church.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.360]   And when you talk about church, we're not talking about Berean community church.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.040]   We're not talking about the organization.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   We're talking about you.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.400]   We're talking about me.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.440]   And there are some times when it's hard for me to be patient and my flesh comes out.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.360]   And then the word of God reminds me how much he loves you.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:24.240]   How every single one of you was precious enough for God to send his only begotten son.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.760]   Think about that.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:32.880]   Not just the most precious thing, most precious thing that God the Father had, he sent to
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.460]   purchase you.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:40.200]   And so that changed my paradigm and it continues to change my paradigm.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.900]   Every time I get impatient, it's like, well, these are not outsiders.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.900]   These are not foreigners.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:50.380]   These are my brothers that Jesus died to purchase.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.900]   And so it changes my paradigm.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.100]   It changes the way I look at you.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.480]   It changes the way I view the church.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.140]   So when he says not to conform but be transformed by the renewing of our mind, it is our very
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:06.840]   minds that has conformed to the pattern of this world, our flesh, our thoughts, our ambitions,
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   our hopes that needs to be challenged by the renewing of our mind through his scripture.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Why?
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.640]   So that we may be able to test and approve and accept the will of God.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.560]   That his will is perfect.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:28.800]   That the more we examine his will, the more we will agree with Paul that it is good, that
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.680]   it is acceptable, and it is perfect.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.240]   That his will is perfect.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.040]   Philippians 1, 9 through 10, "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.120]   knowledge and all discernment so that you may approve what is excellent.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.580]   That you may understand experientially what is excellent.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.840]   Whatever it is that you are pursuing in light of God's will will become rubbish."
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   Right?
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.080]   Isn't that what Paul says in Philippians?
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.200]   In light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ that everything that he had became
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.120]   rubbish.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.240]   If you compare that to anything else in the world, it's not rubbish.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.120]   The world offers what it offers.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.980]   It's not rubbish in comparison to other things.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.840]   Only in light of Christ it becomes rubbish.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.200]   So an individual who is not being renewed in his mind, his thoughts, and his heart,
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.220]   the world will always be a temptation to you.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.000]   Because your heart will always long for it.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Why not?
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Because they seem to be happy.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   The world seems to, if they have more money, they seem to be happy.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.880]   You know, people say, "Oh, money doesn't make you happy."
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.440]   Rubbish.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.680]   You know, they tell you that because it's hard to make money.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.800]   But you ask people who have money, say, "You want to let it go?"
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   Money, again, I'm not saying money itself will make you happy, but money will pay for
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.520]   your bills and take away some of your anxiety.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.760]   Right?
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:05.600]   If you're trying to overcome that temptation by your pure will, yeah, we're going to fail.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.880]   That's why he says to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, that our values, what
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.520]   we hope for, what we're longing for, to have an eternal perspective, that this is a place
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.580]   that we're just passing through, that this place is under judgment of God.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:25.200]   What we saw in the book of Revelation is what this world is headed to, so why invest so
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.800]   much here when we're just passing through?
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.880]   To be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.560]   Psalm 34, verse 8 says, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.400]   Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him."
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.840]   Taste.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   Embrace His will.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:49.920]   Establish Him as Lord in your life, in time, in finance, in our youth, when we're older.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.080]   Taste and see that the Lord is good, that you may be able to test and approve, which
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.880]   is acceptable and perfect will of God.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.520]   Ephesians 5, 17, "Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.560]   Understand what the will of the Lord.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.680]   Discern and prove His will.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.760]   Matthew 11, 28-30, Jesus invites us, "Come to me, all who labor and heavy laden, and
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.400]   I will give you rest.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.960]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.760]   You will find rest for your souls."
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:27.880]   How much of the turmoil inside of us is because we're between two worlds, where one is in
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:35.280]   direct contradiction with the other, and you live with this constant pressure of trying
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:43.320]   to satisfy both, and you just cannot, because God will not allow it.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.400]   He who is heavy laden and burdened, somehow you're going to find rest.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.920]   The Sabbath that was broken at creation, that somehow you're going to find this Sabbath
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.400]   with money, you're going to find this Sabbath in marriage, somehow you're going to find
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.280]   this Sabbath in having children.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.520]   He said, "That's a lie."
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   Sabbath is found in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.680]   Verse 30, "For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.280]   You know that word for easy is literally, it means to fit well, to fit well.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.320]   In other words, God created you to glorify Him.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.600]   He made us in His image, and it is His glory that we fell short.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:29.240]   So salvation and redemption is to restore us back to what He intended for us.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.440]   And so He says, "For my yoke is well fitting."
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.160]   His work is well fitting for us.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.800]   So when we begin to function and begin to live, and the more we glorify God, the more
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.040]   we feel alive, if you find life in Christ, you will pursue Him.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.800]   If you find life in the world, you will pursue it.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.920]   But the invitation and the promise that He gives is that if you take His yoke upon you,
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.800]   you will find rest.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.960]   For His yoke is what you were created for, to glorify Christ.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.520]   The more God is glorified in you, the more you feel alive.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.200]   That's what Jesus meant when He says He came to give life, to give this life abundantly.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.920]   I'm going to read a final passage before I invite you to take some time to pray.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.720]   Proverbs 3, 5-8, it says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.680]   Do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:31.180]   In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.560]   Be not wise in your own eyes.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.760]   Fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.440]   It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones."
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:46.520]   I'm going to invite the praise team to again come up, and I'm going to ask you guys again
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.440]   to take some time to pray.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:56.480]   And I want to be more specific in asking you to pray, like what to pray for.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   You're college students, and you're wrestling over what major, what path to take.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.400]   Do you simply make decisions based upon how much money you're going to make, the brighter
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   future?
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.480]   Does that have anything to do with Christ?
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.680]   Those of you who are singles, you want to get married, you want to find a better job,
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.800]   and you have these pursuits.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.960]   Are you following the pattern of this world?
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.720]   Are you being transformed by the renewing of your mind?
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.440]   Does that have anything to do with Christ and His kingdom?
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.460]   Those of you who are married, now that you're married and you have somebody to run this
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.320]   race with, are you running?
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.800]   Are you just enjoying life together?
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.440]   But does your marriage have anything to do with pursuing Christ?
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.520]   Does it have anything to do with glorifying Christ?
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.600]   Those of you who have children, your perspective on raising kids, is it following the pattern
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.840]   of this world, provide what's best, give them what's best, keep them safe?
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.080]   Is it the pattern of this world?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.680]   Or even the ways you raise your children, even the way you value your children, is it
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   kingdom-minded?
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.600]   Are we being renewed?
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.920]   Are we being transformed by the renewing of our mind where we have godly perspective?
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.040]   Let's take our time to really reflect where we are.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.160]   Are we conforming to room temperature?
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.000]   Are we just conforming to what's around us?
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.400]   Are we genuinely being transformed by the Word of God and His mind?
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.920]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us, and to be specific, to pray
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.120]   for ourselves, and pray the Psalmist's prayer.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.960]   Search me and know me, see if there's any hurtful ways in me, and to challenge me that
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.240]   I may be transformed and to live for His glory.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.920]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
