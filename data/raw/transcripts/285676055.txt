[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15 verses 14 through 16, I'm going
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.040]   to be reading that.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'm just going to give you a heads up.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.760]   I'm not going to go into too much detail today, but I'm just letting you know that we're switching
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.600]   to the NASB.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.640]   I know most of you probably are using the ESV.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.400]   How many of you using the ESV?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   Okay.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   All right.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.480]   How many of you are not using the ESV?
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.840]   How many of you use the NASB?
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.120]   Okay.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.280]   So you guys are safe.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.120]   So we're not saying that everybody has to use the ESV, but we're just letting you know,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.960]   again, I'm not going to go into too much detail that throughout the years we've come to the
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.000]   conclusion, at least in the pastoral staff and the leaders that we prefer the NASB because
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.560]   it is closer to the original language and we felt like they did a better job as we were
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.040]   studying through it to translate it to get us to better meaning.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.880]   So whatever translation you use, I mean, ESV is a good translation, but I'm just giving
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.040]   you a heads up that starting from next week, I'll be reading out of the NASB and the verses
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880]   that we're quoting and the Bible that I will be reading out of is the NASB.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   Okay?
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.280]   All right.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.000]   But today's the last day I'm going to be reading the ESV, but the passages on the screen will
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.120]   be in the NASB.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.280]   So if you get confused, just to confuse you today, that's what I did.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   Okay.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.240]   I forgot to bring my NASB Bible at home.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   I was all prepared to present and then I forgot to bring it.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920]   So I'm using the ESV to read today.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.440]   I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.340]   filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.500]   But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder because of the grace
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.520]   given me by God to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.960]   of the gospel of God so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.640]   Gracious God, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have to worship you.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.240]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize the gift that we have, that our worship, our service, our
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.800]   giving, our fellowship, all of it may be a reasonable act of worship.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.240]   We pray, Father, that your word, what you have ordained to bring your church to salvation,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.480]   to sanctify us and ultimately redeem us, will fulfill its purpose this morning.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Amen.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   Again, as you know, as we're starting through the book of Romans, typically when we get
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.360]   to chapter five where we are now up to the end of the chapter, chapter 16, it's kind
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.640]   of like the conclusion.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.880]   This is why Paul wrote it.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200]   This is what he's doing.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   And then it kind of concludes.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   So typically we think of the meat of the book of Romans is in the first eight chapters,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   and in particular chapter eight.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.040]   And then starting from chapter nine through chapter 11, it's kind of like the, you know,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.440]   it gives you an outline of redemptive history in the nation of Israel and what he's planning
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.940]   to do in the future.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.520]   He's going to bring in the Gentiles and later on the Israelites are going to be grafted
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   in.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.160]   And then chapter 12 is the imperatives.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.680]   In light of all of that, what should we do?
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760]   And so some of you lean more heavily toward the imperatives.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.320]   You don't have the patience for the indicative.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.560]   These are the doctrines, so therefore this is what we ought to do.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.520]   So I know that just from talking to you.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   Some of you guys just want to tell me what to do.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.080]   Like all the whys and the foundation, that's great, but tell me what should we do?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.920]   So that's chapter 12.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.240]   How should a Christian respond to this tremendous grace?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.040]   But by the time we get to chapter 15, just kind of like one big gigantic sermon, this
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.200]   is why he wrote the letter and then the end and then you move on.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.440]   And so many people have asked me already, I think mindset-wise, I've already kind of
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.860]   like, we're concluded.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.920]   What other book are we going to get into?
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.920]   These are legitimate questions, but chapter 15, where we're at up to the end of the chapter,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.160]   I'm actually taking a bit more time than normal because what is contained in here is actually
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.540]   Paul's application of everything that he's been teaching.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.520]   This is his own description of his ministry, of his life, and why he wrote this letter
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.360]   and what he's trying to conclude.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.740]   So chapter 1 through chapter 11 is about the gospel of Christ.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.780]   Chapter 12 to chapter 15 is about the application of it in the church.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.600]   And then chapter 15, where we are at to the end, basically Paul is describing himself.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.960]   He's describing how he's applying the very things that he's been teaching.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.180]   And so I'm taking a little bit extra time and our focus this morning is going to be
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.360]   on verse 16, a part of verse 15.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.580]   And I'm not going to go this slow throughout the rest of the chapters, but I think it's
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.660]   important enough for us to realize the application of it because it has ramification on all of
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.020]   us.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.060]   I know that reading Christian biographies is probably often recommended, and I highly
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.340]   recommend it because it encourages us and men and women of faith that have gone before
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.700]   us and who set an example of what we ought to do.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.020]   So a lot of times we think of Christian life and then we have these ideas, but we don't
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.220]   know what it should look like in the life of an average Christian.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.980]   But sometimes the danger of reading these biographies is that they highlight certain
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.980]   extra special moments in their life.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.540]   And then after you read it, you think, "Wow, these are super Christian.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.900]   These are people that are not normal or average.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.540]   They didn't have a nine to five job."
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.060]   So it's hard for us to relate.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.420]   In fact, I don't really like reading biographies for that reason because oftentimes it's highlighted
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.580]   and they sound like superhuman.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.340]   I remember early on as a Christian reading about Martin Luther and how he would wake
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.480]   up at three in the morning and spend three hours in prayer.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.200]   And then when he was busy, he would pray four hours.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.420]   And then during the day he preached five sermons and then how he wrote all these books and
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.420]   commentaries.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.600]   And after you read that, your first response is challenge.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.620]   And then second response is despair.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.620]   Right?
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.620]   Because what?
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.680]   He did what?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.240]   You talk about missionaries, how they left everything, went into the jungle, ate one
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.220]   meal a week and you know what I mean, drank crazy things.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.220]   And then they became Christian and they planted 50 churches all over the world.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.940]   And you read that, it's like, "Wow, that's great."
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.940]   And then second response is, "Okay, I can't, that's never going to happen to me."
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.940]   Right?
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.740]   So a lot of times you read these biographies and then you highlight and sometimes exaggerate
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.740]   it.
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.660]   Like these are superhuman beings that a few select people were able to experience that
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.260]   most Christians wouldn't even be able to relate.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.540]   But the thing that I love about the scripture, the scripture, if you read every character
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.360]   in the Bible, they're all flawed human beings.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.420]   Every single one of them.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.420]   Every single one of them.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.900]   You see, even David is a man after God's own heart.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.380]   You look, examine his life carefully.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.300]   He had all kinds of flaws.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.980]   Abraham, you know, even though he was a man of faith, he's afraid that he's going to get
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.100]   killed because of his wife and then say, "Hey, lie that you're my sister so that I can save
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.100]   my neck.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   Maybe they'll take you but not me."
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.140]   I mean, every single human being is completely flawed.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.700]   Even the writers of the New Testament, you know, a lot of people reject the Bible and
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.380]   they say, "Oh, this is written by man for their own advantage."
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.580]   Humanly speaking, it makes absolutely no sense because the writers of the New Testament made
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.200]   themselves look bad.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:41.260]   When Jesus was resurrected, the authors who wrote about it described themselves as cowards
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.620]   and unbelievers and they weren't the ones who first ran to the grave.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.140]   And in fact, even after they saw him, some of them doubted, "How could this be?"
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.400]   There's no human being written in Scripture that comes out perfect.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.100]   And that's part of the reason why I love the Scriptures because it's honest and it's just
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.300]   the actual presentation of what happens.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:14.780]   So the only individual that comes out glorified is God and God alone.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.940]   The reason why I mention all of this is we were just at a retreat and we said the first
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:25.180]   and most important vision of our church, what we're trying to work toward is God-centered
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.340]   worship where we don't scan the church, we don't scan our society, we don't scan our
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.660]   generation to find out, you know, what is an itch that our generation has and then we
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.500]   start to scratch that itch and then more people will come to our church.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.780]   That is not our goal.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:47.900]   Our desire in our church that every church ought to have based upon Scripture is God-centered.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   Is God glorified?
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.900]   Is God pleased?
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.660]   Is the Word of God being taught?
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.660]   Is He being magnified?
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:59.180]   And the reason why this is so central to the church is if you build a church, trying to
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:05.980]   scratch the felt needs of the church is no different than giving a child candy at 11
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.180]   p.m.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.100]   They'll be happy for the moment but long-term you know his teeth are going to get rotten.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.660]   Long-term you know you're raising a child who thinks that the universe revolves around
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.380]   them and they may be, the parents may be able to put up with that but as soon as he steps
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.220]   out of the house, no one's going to tolerate that.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.020]   So you're not actually doing them a favor.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.740]   You're actually creating a child who's going to be rejected everywhere he goes.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:38.940]   So to build a church based upon what makes you happy actually ends up ruining you.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.300]   They're not doing you any favor.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.860]   That's why when Christ is exalted and we are reminded that the goal of our life and the
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.960]   church is not you but God.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.980]   Not only is He glorified but when He is glorified we experience true life.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:01.820]   Not the superficial life, not just superficial scratching of our back because it's itching
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:08.020]   but when we recognize the King of Kings and Lord of Lords as the Lord of our life, we
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:13.580]   experience what God intended from the beginning of creation.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.660]   That we are meant to be image bearers.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.460]   That when God looks at, when people look at us, that they are to see Christ glorified
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.180]   and when we do that, we live.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.500]   I mention all of this because Apostle Paul was a man who understood this very clearly.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.980]   He was so deeply affected by what happened to him that it affected everything that he
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.300]   did, everything that he said.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:47.220]   Every sacrifice that he made was directly affected by what happened to him when he met
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.700]   Christ on the road to Damascus.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.060]   This morning I'm going to be looking at the short passage in verse 15 and 16 how Paul
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.780]   describes his own ministry.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.860]   So the first thing that he says, mentioned in verse 15, he says, "But on some point
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.100]   I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder because of the grace given me by
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   God."
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.700]   And I know it's a passing thing that he says but it's important enough for us to stop and
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.180]   take a look because he says this almost every time he mentioned his ministry that his ministry
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.980]   was not by his works but by the grace that he was given.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.620]   Now why is this so essential?
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.160]   Not only to Paul's ministry but to our daily spiritual life?
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.020]   Because once we forget that the only reason why you and I are here is because God was
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.620]   gracious to us, we begin to grumble.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.260]   We begin to look at what we have, what we don't have, and we begin to compare and covet
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.780]   and all of a sudden grumbling begins to creep into our hearts.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.780]   And we become cross-centered.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:55.660]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3.10, "According to the grace of God which was given to me
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.420]   like a wise master builder, I laid a foundation and another is building on it, but each man
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.460]   must be careful how he builds on it."
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.180]   He sees himself writing this excruciating letter and he recognizes that his ministry
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.860]   to them was by God's grace.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.380]   It wasn't simply out of obligation but God's grace.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.300]   Again in 1 Corinthians 15.10, "But by the grace of God I am what I am."
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.420]   It wasn't because he had potential.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.260]   It wasn't because he was a diamond in the rough that was sitting there that nobody noticed
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.840]   other than God.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.740]   Everybody else bypassed him but this diamond that was sitting in the rough, he somehow
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.100]   picked it up and he dusted it off.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.020]   That's how the Bible describes us.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.620]   The Bible describes us as dead in our trespasses.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.620]   Dead in our trespasses.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.060]   It wasn't like a diamond in the rough that everybody bypassed.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.020]   We were blasphemers.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.900]   We were idolaters.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.020]   We were completely dead in our trespasses.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:04.620]   And the only reason why you and I are here is because he had complete mercy on us.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.860]   Everything that we have, the reason why you're able to sit here and even listen to what I
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.740]   have to say is because of the grace of God.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.740]   You didn't will yourself.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860]   You may say, "Well, I woke up.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.860]   I put on my clothes.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   I brushed my teeth.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.860]   I came here."
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.580]   But the only reason why you were even attracted to Christ, why you're here listening and understanding
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.300]   what I have to say is because God opened your ear.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.840]   It's because he softened your heart.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.980]   He put certain people in your life to bring the gospel to you and it was by the mercy
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   of God.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.480]   It is the kindness of God that led you to repentance.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.760]   If there's somebody in your life that cared enough for you to bring you to church or share
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.440]   the gospel with you, that wasn't your doing.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.000]   That was God's doing.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.160]   It was by his mercy.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.760]   Everything that we have, even our ministry, even our hardship was by the grace of God.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.340]   It's because he was gracious to us.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.920]   A Christian who lives his life in continual grumbling is like an individual who wins a
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.240]   free ticket to the greatest playoff ever.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.880]   You know, the Lakers are playing against the Warriors and LeBron James, you know, performs
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   a miracle.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.340]   We get to the seventh game and this is the sellout ticket.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.840]   You know, the Warriors are looking like they're going to finally lose.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.580]   Right?
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.900]   It may happen, right?
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.900]   So this happens.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:37.220]   We're in the seventh game, they're in the Staples Center and somehow you win the ticket
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.420]   and you're elated that you got the ticket, but the whole time you're headed toward the
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.940]   Staples Center, you're complaining about how far the Staples Center is.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.820]   And when you get there, you're complaining about how the parking is horrible.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.740]   And then when you get there, you're complaining about how long this line is to get in there.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.620]   And then when you get in there, you're complaining about the location of your seat.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.180]   And then when you get to the seat, you're complaining about how hard the seat is.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.420]   And then when you get there, you complain about how nasty the food is and how overpriced
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.940]   it is.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.100]   And the whole time you're experiencing this free ticket to get to this game, you're complaining
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.540]   about everything about it.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.220]   And you forget about what it is that you have.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.460]   See that's a Christian.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.800]   That's a Christian who won the greatest lottery and we spend the rest of the time complaining
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.220]   about the church, the people, our surroundings, what we have, what we don't have, air conditioning.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.940]   I mean, the kind of stuff that we grumble about in the context of what it is that God
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:44.580]   has given us when we lose focus of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.460]   Apostle Paul was beaten for his faith.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.420]   In fact, eventually he dies because of his faith.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.920]   He is head beheaded, but he never forgot what it is that he had in Christ.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.340]   As difficult as his life was, because he met Christ, he understood this as his grace.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.720]   The reason why he's able to be in a position to teach other people about the love of Christ
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.320]   is because he was given that love of Christ.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.420]   Not only does having a proper perspective of what it is that we have in Christ, his
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.940]   grace, it keeps us humble because it is by grace.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:28.360]   It's not anything that you've done because our natural tendency is, you know, you walk
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.760]   into a room, you measure people.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.420]   You say, "Oh, you know," not to be judgmental.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.720]   We're all judgmental.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.040]   You walk in, you know exactly who's taller than you and shorter than you.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.240]   I don't have to ask you.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.440]   You've already measured it in your head.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.580]   You already know, right?
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.800]   Who's good looking, who you don't think is good looking, who's athletic, who's not athletic.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.280]   You have it all in your head already.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.040]   You just may not say it, right?
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.640]   We all have a tendency that if we think we're a little bit better or if we've done a little
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.680]   bit better, if we've read a little bit more, we have a tendency to think that, "Oh, this
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   is what we have."
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.640]   And so our natural tendency in the church is when you're doing well, you come to church
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.200]   and you measure everybody based upon what you think you're doing well.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.420]   And then if you're not doing well, you kind of draw back.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.740]   "Oh man, you know, I don't want to be here at church and everybody's judging me."
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.420]   And then we have communion table inviting people to come.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   It's not by your merit.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.680]   And then you say, "Oh yeah, but I don't deserve it."
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.140]   You never deserve it to begin with.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.340]   That's what the whole purpose of this table.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.700]   The only way that we can be reconciled to God was by His mercy.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.420]   There's nothing that you could have done.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.300]   And that's what the gospel teaches us at its core.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.700]   It humbles us that no matter how high you are, no matter how low you are, the gate to
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.860]   get in is the same.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:54.020]   And so recognizing and understanding that grace not only causes us to have a different
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.180]   attitude toward everything, it humbles us.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.700]   Romans 12.3 says, "For through the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.260]   think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to have sound
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.700]   judgment, as God has allowed it to each a measure of faith."
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.860]   Not to think of yourself more highly.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.820]   The scripture says we've been saved by grace, not by works.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.380]   For what purpose?
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.260]   So that no one may boast.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:30.580]   A Christian who boasts is contradicting the very core of what he professes.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.140]   A Christian who boasts about his righteousness, about what he is doing, what he has accomplished,
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.020]   goes directly against the very core of what he professes.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.340]   Because what he professes is, "I was a sinner in need of his mercy, and God had mercy on
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340]   me.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.140]   Instead of striking me dead, he sent his only begotten Son to save me."
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.780]   So an individual who begins his walk with God with that confession, to be filled with
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.580]   boasting is a contradiction.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.620]   First Corinthians 4.7, "For who sees anything different in you?
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.620]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.780]   If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?"
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:18.420]   Any boasting as a Christian, for any reason, goes directly against every song that we sing,
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.380]   every passage that we study.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:27.620]   See, Paul was a man who God used tremendously for his work.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:33.740]   And if there's one thing that God was concerned about this man, it was pride.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.580]   And in Corinthians it says God deliberately put a thorn on his side.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.580]   For what purpose?
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.500]   To keep him humble.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:46.500]   To remind him that it is only when he is weak, Christ is strong.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.620]   So the fact that Paul describes his ministry as the grace of God, not because of his talent,
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:57.820]   not because of his Roman citizenship, not because of his great education, but why?
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.860]   In 1 Timothy 1.15.17, the saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.820]   Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.140]   He wasn't saved because of this.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.740]   He was diamond in the rough that everybody bypassed.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.100]   He said he was saved because he was a sinner.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:20.460]   Verse 16, "But I receive mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.660]   might display his perfect patience as an example to those who are to believe in him for eternal
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.940]   life."
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.940]   Not to highlight Paul, not to look at this diamond in the rough that was claimed for
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:39.540]   God's purpose, but if God can clean that filth off of that man, it's to highlight his grace.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.500]   It's to highlight Christ, not Paul, not his ministry, not his work.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:52.020]   To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.580]   ever.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:00.740]   If we put our confidence in anything else but Christ, it's just a matter of time that
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   you're going to get disappointed.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:10.740]   If we think in any way that we add to anything that Christ has done, it's just a matter of
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.780]   time he will humble us.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.460]   Again, he says in 1 Corinthians 3, 5-7, "What then is Apollos and what is Paul?
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.740]   Servants through whom you believe that even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.500]   I planted Apollos' water, but God was the one who caused the growth."
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.220]   So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but God who causes
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.040]   the growth.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:41.700]   So at the center of our walk with God is the emptying of ourselves.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:47.060]   And even in the way that we are sanctified at times, if we're not careful, we get sanctified
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.140]   by adding.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.140]   We become more disciplined, we become more this, we become more that.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.980]   And all of these things in and of itself is not bad.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.500]   In fact, it is commanded in Scripture.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:04.020]   But the central calling of every Christian is to empty himself.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.420]   Is become nothing.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:13.380]   And just like Christ said, "He who finds his life will lose it."
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.360]   How much of our energy, how much of our life, how much of our decision do we confess one
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:25.980]   thing at church on Sunday and live the rest of our lives trying to be somebody?
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.260]   Think about that.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:33.740]   Think about how much of our life we profess to have been crucified with Christ and it
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:39.220]   is no longer us that lives, but Christ who lives in us.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.660]   These are the songs that we sing.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.840]   This is the word that we read.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.900]   This is the fellowship that we participate in.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:52.580]   And then Monday through Saturday, work hard to become somebody.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.980]   No wonder Christians are frustrated.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:04.500]   Because at our very core of our life, we're living a contradiction.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:12.980]   The gospel not only causes us to celebrate, it causes us to be humbled.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.100]   Secondly, Paul's ministry was an act of worship.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.260]   In Romans 15, 16, Paul says, "To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:30.060]   as a priest, the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable,
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.900]   sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.260]   What does that verse remind you of?
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.980]   This is a test to see how many of you are thinking critically.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.380]   What does that verse remind you of?
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.740]   We've been studying through the book of Leviticus.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.820]   That's a hint.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.820]   What scene do you get when you read that verse?
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:56.300]   I know you're all thinking it.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.020]   Leviticus, right?
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.060]   This is what we've been studying.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060]   This is the temple worship.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.740]   So Paul's describing his ministry as a priest offering up sacrifices to God.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   That's how he describes it.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.940]   In fact, the very word that he uses here for minister is the word "letruo."
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.420]   Some of you guys may remember that from previous sermons that I gave.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:21.900]   So some of the verses translated that word, "letruo," as worship in Romans 12, verse
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   1.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.180]   "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.540]   holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship."
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.420]   The word worship here is "letruo."
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.100]   It's the word that is used here in verse 16 to minister.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:44.020]   So Paul is saying his ministry of grace is an act of worship that he gives to God.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.220]   And then the Gentiles that he's preaching the gospel to are the sacrifice he's offering
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.660]   to God to be acceptable.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.540]   What does it mean for a sacrifice to be acceptable?
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.900]   If you remember the book of Leviticus, in order for an animal to be offered to God,
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.700]   what was the first criteria?
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.820]   Without blemish.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.660]   It had to be without blemish, without defect.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.860]   So does Paul mean that he's looking to the Gentiles to see who's perfect, who's got the
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.180]   straight nose, whose back doesn't hurt, who has clear sight, 20/20 sight?
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.900]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.940]   No.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:28.380]   We know, even just from the book of Leviticus, that the only way that a sacrifice in the
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.500]   new covenant can be made perfect is by the blood of Christ.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.020]   So he's describing his gospel ministry as giving and offering to God.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.860]   Ultimately, again, not only is our salvation initiated by God's grace, his whole ministry
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.460]   is an act of worship that he gives to God.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.100]   And that's how he describes it again.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.460]   He says, "Ministering as what?
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.940]   As a priest."
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:56.580]   So his whole description is like a priest who has come to worship God.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.780]   The Gentiles to be offered as a sacrifice.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.180]   First Thessalonians 2, 19-20 says, "For who is our hope or joy, our crown or exaltation?
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.780]   Is it not even you?
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:14.180]   In the presence of our Lord Jesus that is coming, for you are our glory and joy."
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.460]   Paul was pursuing joy.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:25.020]   When we think of worship, again, in the context of religion, in the context of Christianity
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:31.500]   that you grew up in, when we think of worship, we think of Sunday, right?
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.580]   And typically, it shouldn't be, but typically, we think of worship and we think of like,
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.780]   "Oh, I wonder what sermons are going to be given today.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.140]   I wonder how long it's going to be."
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.980]   You know, I wonder, and then we kind of get in the habit of just critiquing worship.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:50.460]   It was good, it was bad, I liked the songs, I didn't like the songs, you know, and we
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.620]   think of worship in that way.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:59.340]   In every other context, when we say, "You worship something," what do we mean by that?
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.220]   It means you are obsessed, that's what that means.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.340]   You worship the Lakers.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.320]   You're getting kind of carried away, right?
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.380]   You put too much attention.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.980]   You talk about it too much, you invested too much in that.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.240]   You fall in love with a girl, like you worship that girl, right?
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.440]   It means that you're thinking about her too much, you're investing too much, you're sacrificing
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.980]   everything for her.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.620]   That's what that word means when we say worship.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.980]   Something that is very valuable to you, that you're willing to give everything in exchange.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:37.980]   So the word worship in and of itself, even the way we use it in plain language, in English,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.020]   it means to adore something.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.300]   It is never done grudgingly.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.180]   In fact, when we say, "You should stop worshipping that," "We should stop worshipping her," it
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.260]   means you need to hold back.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:28:01.500]   But when we think about worshipping God, we think about a time, we think about an activity,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.100]   we think about an event or a sermon or songs or how we open up our mouth and how things
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.620]   are organized.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.580]   That's what Jesus meant when he said there's going to come a time when he's going to be
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.940]   looking for worshippers who will worship in what?
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.380]   Spirit and in truth.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.500]   True worshippers.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:28.780]   When Paul said, "In view of this great mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:34.820]   which is your reasonable act of worship based upon this grace," that's exactly what Paul
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.060]   was doing.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.180]   Paul was worshipping God through his ministry.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.700]   He was glorifying and honoring God.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.860]   Why is this so important?
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:53.380]   Because God did not send his only begotten son and die for our sins.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.980]   Was crucified and resurrected and interceding on our behalf, depositing the Holy Spirit
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:04.900]   just so people who don't go to church can go to church.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:10.340]   He didn't do all of that so that people who don't pay can pay.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.980]   People who aren't generous could be generous.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.620]   People who aren't involved with church to be involved with church.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:25.760]   He didn't have to send his only begotten son and absorb our sins to do that.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:34.140]   The whole point of his sacrifice is to restore the worship that was lost.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:41.860]   So the thing that God desires more than anything else in view of this mercy is to worship him.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:47.180]   Let me ask you, when was the last time you really worshipped God?
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.260]   I'm not talking about when's the last time you came to church, when's the last time you
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.260]   read your Bible.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.540]   When did you last time worship God?
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:02.520]   The way we use that word for any other purpose, in every other context, the way we would use
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:10.980]   that word to describe the way you are obsessed with sports, where you are obsessed with vacations.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:17.360]   When was the last time you worshipped God biblically?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.980]   You adored him.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.860]   Where somebody told you, "Wow, you are really obsessed with your God."
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:34.500]   See, that's what God desires, and the reason why recognizing his grace is so crucial, so
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   central is because until we recognize his grace in our life, worship is manufactured.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.480]   Worship is meant to be inspired.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.840]   Not something that you determined to do, not something because you tried hard or you showed
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.620]   up early or you gave more money.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:01.820]   But when you recognize what it is that you have in Christ, you worship.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.860]   Philippians 1, 21-24, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.680]   If I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me, and I do not know
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.640]   which to choose.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.140]   But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ,
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.380]   and for that is very much better."
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.180]   You know what Paul just said?
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:28.020]   He's sitting in prison, instead of writing to this church and saying, "Hey, can you guys
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.020]   organize a campaign to get me out of here?
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.260]   It's hard, you know?
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.060]   The food is not good.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.900]   I'm chained to this Roman guard.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.540]   This guy stinks, doesn't take shower."
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.900]   I mean, none of that.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:50.020]   He's writing as he is chained, as a prisoner, saying, "If it was up to me, I'd rather die.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.060]   I'm ready to go."
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.140]   He knew Christ so intimately.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   He knew Christ so intimately.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:05.460]   He said, "For to me, to die is gain, because that means I get to go to Him, and I'm ready
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.740]   to go."
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:14.140]   He got a taste of God's goodness, and he was so consumed.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:22.100]   He was so consumed with the things of Christ that even if he died preaching this gospel,
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:28.540]   he said, "I'm ready, but the only reason why I will stay is because God is not done with
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.460]   you."
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.420]   He says, verse 24, "Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.820]   Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.820]   and joy in the faith."
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.460]   Paul was not a better man than us, humanly speaking.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.740]   In fact, he calls himself the worst of sinners.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.220]   He was not more determined than us.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.460]   He was not more benevolent than us.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:04.220]   Paul met the resurrected Christ, and his eye was opened, and he was never the same.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.340]   His desire to be with the Lord, which caused him to worship, caused him to ultimately give
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.340]   his life.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:18.660]   What God desires is worship, not to put in our time, and you know the difference.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   When you come to worship, you have a certain allotment of time that you allow in the church,
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.940]   because it's a necessary burden that you have to bear.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.660]   So Sunday you come, I'll tolerate an hour and a half, if you're good.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.240]   If you're good.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.300]   If I like your sermons, I'll give you 10 more minutes.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:44.580]   If the worship is great, maybe a couple more songs.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.020]   If I go longer than that, how dare you?
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.660]   You had to put in more work than you needed to.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.020]   But when it's worship, it's different.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.520]   When it's worship, you can't have enough.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.140]   When it's worship, you get generous.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.740]   When it's worship, you can't help but to be around other people worshiping God.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.380]   Because when you really worship, it creates joy.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.620]   It creates joy.
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.620]   It's not just something you do.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.820]   When you're not worshiping, it's just putting in your time.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.680]   Do what you need to do.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.000]   You pay your tithe and you're done.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.260]   But when you're worshiping, it's not enough.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.460]   That was the early church.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:38.340]   They got together and they said daily, they were breaking bread.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.100]   They're hanging on to the words of the apostles.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.100]   They were praying.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.420]   And it wasn't mandated.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.860]   They were just selling their stuff and giving it to the church people, sharing with one
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   another.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   There was no mandate.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860]   There was no discipleship.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.060]   There was no modeling.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.920]   It just happened.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.860]   Because they met Christ.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.620]   And they became generous.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.140]   And they became worshipers.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.640]   Paul is not a different man.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.940]   He genuinely met this Christ.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:14.540]   Third and finally, Paul's primary ministry was to preach the gospel.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.060]   His primary ministry was to preach the gospel.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.220]   Second Timothy 4, 1 and 2, it says, "I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and Christ
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:27.500]   Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing, His kingdom, preach
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.740]   the word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.740]   and instruction."
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.180]   So in verse 16, it says, "To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.620]   service of the gospel of God."
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.580]   Paul says it repeatedly over and over when he describes his ministry, that he's a minister
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:51.340]   of Christ for the gospel of Jesus Christ, over and over again.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:57.700]   And almost every time he describes his ministry, it's for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.780]   Sometimes we can get carried away thinking like the primary role of the church is to
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:07.540]   take care of sick people, or the needy people, or the poor people.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.260]   Those are things that God commands us, that they should be the character of a Christian.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:18.420]   But the primary purpose of the church is to preach the gospel.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.420]   Paul says, "I charge you."
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.980]   It's a command.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.620]   This is a military term that a commanding officer uses to his subordinate.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.340]   I charge you, I command you in the presence of God, of Christ Jesus.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.140]   Just in case my authority is not enough, I command you in the presence of God, Jesus
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.860]   Christ, who is the judge, the living and the dead.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.740]   The God that you're going to have to stand before, and by his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:50.060]   the King of kings and Lord of lords, I command you, preach the word.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.120]   Be ready in season and out of season.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.580]   In season, it's easy.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.980]   When you preach the word in season, you're a genius.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   You're doing something right.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   Something great about your sermon, something great about your ministry, because it's in
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.500]   season.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.940]   The testing is how much you believe about the word when it's not in season.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:18.620]   I can tell you that in almost 30 years of ministry and preaching, there are more years
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.300]   that I can tell you was not in season than in season.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.140]   There are more periods when people were not interested.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   And again, every field has their own challenges.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.980]   Some of you guys who are lawyers, doctors, or engineers, you all have specific challenges
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.380]   in your career.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:43.580]   As a pastor, one of the most excruciating things that I have had to do is preach and
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.140]   teach in front of people who could care less.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.100]   I've experienced that.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:58.260]   Whenever at this church, I have to qualify that to protect myself.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.860]   I've been in Bible studies where, "Hey, let's turn to Romans."
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.420]   And they're just staring at me.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.420]   It's like, "Romans?
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:09.540]   Can you turn to Romans?"
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:17.820]   I poured out studying this passage and putting it into Bible study format illustrations.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:24.380]   And I poured my heart into it, and they're looking at me like, "Hey, it's kind of going
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.380]   long."
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:31.940]   I've given sermons, I poured my heart out in tears, begging the church and preaching
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.500]   the gospel.
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.860]   And the first guy comes up to me, he's like, "Man, you were loud."
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.020]   And then he'd walk out.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.100]   And that's not unique to me.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:47.540]   Every pastor who's been preaching for a long time has experienced some of that.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.580]   Why would anybody preach out of season?
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:58.260]   And the temptation that we have when it is out of season is to say, "Well, it's not working.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.700]   Let's try something else."
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:05.100]   And I keep hearing, sadly, that more and more churches are moving away from studying the
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.620]   Bible because people are not interested, which is true.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:15.520]   I had a conversation not too long ago, a couple years ago, as I was preaching through or teaching
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.860]   through Isaiah on Wednesday Bible study.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.660]   He got word that somehow a lot of young people were coming to our church.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.980]   And so he was in his late 50s, and he's been in ministry for a while, and he's struggling
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.420]   in ministry, but somehow he heard that our church was growing.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.940]   And so we got together, and he was asking me about our church philosophy, how I teach,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.460]   and what we do.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.620]   And so he knew that we were teaching the Bible, so he actually came on our website.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.620]   He listened through some of our studies through the book of Isaiah.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.980]   And when we sat down, the first thing he said to me was, "They actually come for that?"
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.300]   That's what he said.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   "They actually come for that?"
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.060]   He's like, "You're just straight teaching Isaiah.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.640]   Who's interested in studying Isaiah?"
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.060]   That's kind of how he thought.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.540]   I said, "Yeah, they're coming."
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.180]   And then he shared with me, the reason why he wanted to meet with me was he wanted to
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.640]   know how we do it.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.700]   What are you doing, because he can't just be teaching the Bible, because there must
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.580]   be something, so he wanted to find out.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.320]   So I'm sitting there telling him, he's like, "No, I mean, that's not it.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.420]   Our ministry is very simple.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.980]   We just teach the Bible, and then we just try to practice what it says.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   That's it."
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.460]   And he was just kind of nodding his head.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.380]   And then he told me that he was considering switching his ministry philosophy, that he
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.580]   was doing all this market-driven stuff, and it's not working.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:41.260]   So he wants to go and just maybe because if I start teaching more heavier stuff, that
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.260]   maybe people will come.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.100]   And that's what he asked me.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.100]   He said, "Do you think they'll come?"
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.620]   And I told him, "No.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.180]   I don't think they'll come."
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.900]   Because the first six, seven years of the church, they didn't come.
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.900]   They didn't come.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.440]   And the general atmosphere, general spiritual atmosphere, especially where we live right
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.760]   now in Orange County, yeah, I mean, if you meet an average Christian, is there a hunger
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   for God's Word?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.140]   No, that's not an average Christian, right?
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:19.260]   So if you're planning to do this to attract people, don't do it, right?
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.220]   And he said, "All right."
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.500]   And he said, "You know, I got to be honest.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.100]   It's hard because he's a struggling pastor, and his livelihood and his identity is all
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.340]   tied up with this church.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.200]   And he's afraid that if he goes down this path, I mean, right now he's trying to change
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.340]   his ministry philosophy because he's losing people.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.300]   And if I change my ministry philosophy, what if we lose more people?"
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.840]   And he said, "This is hard.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.940]   So if it's going to lose more people, I'm not sure if I can do it."
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:52.180]   So I told him, "If you choose to do this because you think that this is somehow going to bring
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:57.460]   more people, don't do it because you're doing it for the wrong reason.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:06.000]   You have to first be convinced that this is what you need to do, in season or out of season.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.040]   And the odds are people will leave.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040]   Odds are people will leave.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   If people came in looking for candy and you're going to all of a sudden give them broccoli,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.800]   there's going to be a lot of people who got used to candy who's not going to want to stay,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   right?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:27.280]   But are you convinced that this is what God called you to do?
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.380]   In season and out of season."
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:37.760]   The scripture is clear that the only hope for mankind is Jesus Christ.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.700]   This is not unique to Berean.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.820]   Anybody who reads the scripture, anybody who pays any attention to anything that they're
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:49.700]   reading in scripture, the only hope is Jesus Christ.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.500]   And the moment we begin to think, "Well, you know, that doesn't work, so let's try something
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.660]   else."
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:00.420]   We try teaching the Bible, it doesn't work, so let's try this program.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.700]   Let's maybe focus our attention on evangelism.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.900]   Let's maybe focus our attention on social justice or whatever it is.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.060]   It's not working, so let's try something else.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.860]   There's a reason why he says to preach in season and out of season, because Paul, when
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.220]   he is writing this letter, is out of season.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.400]   It wasn't like the Philippians.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.980]   It wasn't like when he was writing Romans.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.220]   People were beginning to fall out.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.060]   They were leaving.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:32.020]   And the last letter that he writes to Timothy is telling him, "Do not move from what you
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.620]   have already received.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.740]   Do not move.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:39.220]   Even if everybody leaves, you stay the course."
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.180]   That's why he says, "I command you in the presence of our God and Savior Jesus Christ,
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:51.780]   who is to judge the living and the dead, who is the king over all things, I command you,
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:57.140]   preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.300]   Sometimes it bears fruit.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.900]   Sometimes it seems like it's going nowhere.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:08.620]   But you and I do not have any other hope except Christ.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.300]   The problem of loneliness is not community.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.340]   We have people who are staggering from church to church looking to connect with people.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.800]   Loneliness did not come in because of lack of people in our lives.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.140]   Look at scripture.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.100]   Loneliness is a result of sin.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:30.700]   As soon as sin came in, shame caused people to hide.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:37.340]   And that's why you can be in a room filled with people and feel absolutely alone.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:41.940]   The problem of loneliness is not lack of community.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.300]   The problem of loneliness ultimately is sin.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.060]   Until our vertical relationship with God is restored, our horizontal relationship with
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.020]   God will always be superficial.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:59.220]   The problem of relational issues is not communication.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.980]   You can have all the tools to properly communicate and then not do it.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.660]   Everything that we communicate comes through a sinful filter.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.860]   So if somebody asked you, you know, they cooked a meal for you and then you don't like the
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.740]   food and they say, "Oh, what do you think?"
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.660]   You may be salty, you may not like it, but you're already thinking in your head, "If
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.420]   I say this, they're going to get angry."
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.420]   Right?
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.500]   You clearly, you know what's in your head, but now you're thinking, like, "If I say
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   this, what are they going to think?
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.500]   And they're going to get mad at me.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.980]   And if they get mad at me, they're not going to invite me again."
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.700]   And, you know, you're thinking through all of these things before you say, "It's all
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.260]   right."
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:46.740]   Everything that we communicate comes through a sinful filter of self-protection, self-preservation,
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.840]   my reputation, what are you going to think of me?
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.060]   It always comes through some kind of sinful filter.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.780]   So you can have all the tools of properly communicating, but until the sin in us is
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:05.560]   rectified with the blood of Christ, communication is just having all the tools but have no hands
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.260]   to use it.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:15.500]   The problem with world hunger is not food.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.420]   Anybody knows who does any kind of work, any kind of research knows that there's enough
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.220]   food being produced every year to feed the whole world over.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.220]   You know that.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.220]   Look at our trash cans.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:32.020]   It's just concentrated and hoarded by a small group of people, which is us.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.540]   So the problem with hunger in this world is not lack of food.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:41.980]   It's a sin in the world that causes some to hoard and see the needs of the rest of the
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.460]   world and not care.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.180]   So God has given us enough food.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.940]   So it's not simply like, "If we could just produce more food, people would be better."
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:57.620]   Every single human problem that you and I can think of, it came in because of the fall.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:03.100]   To think that somehow a problem that was started by sin, that we're going to somehow solve
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:09.300]   it by human ingenuity, is human arrogance.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:14.540]   The only solution that you and I have for this sin that came into our lives, into this
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:19.620]   world that ruined everything, it ruined our marriages, it ruined our children, it ruined
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:26.940]   our community, it ruined our economy, it ruined our family.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.580]   The only remedy to that is Christ.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:38.060]   And the only way to get to Christ is through his blood.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:44.100]   That's why he said, "Preach it in season and out of season."
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:53.140]   Preach it in season and out of season, because it is the only solution to all of man's problems.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.020]   Let me read this one passage and then we'll wrap up.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.820]   1 Corinthians 1, 17-25.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.140]   For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.700]   speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:11.480]   For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.500]   being saved it is the power of God, for it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:22.540]   the wise, and the cleverness of the clever will set aside."
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.540]   Where is the wise man?
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   Where is the scribe?
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.900]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.860]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.180]   For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:37.660]   well pleased through the foolishness of this message, preached to save those who believe.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:45.540]   For indeed, Jews ask for signs, Greeks are searching for wisdom, but we preach Christ
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.820]   crucified.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:55.140]   Until the church recognizes that the solution is not man, is not our money, is not our hard
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:59.940]   work, but when we meet Christ.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:05.220]   That's why the first and the most important vision of our church is Christ-centered worship,
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:09.940]   God-centered worship, because all the things, even the things that we don't connect with
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.960]   our sins, know it or not, it is connected.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.820]   Your marriage problems is connected to sin.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.340]   Problem with our children, it's connected to our sins.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.260]   Feeling of loneliness is connected to sin.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.820]   Even our illnesses, that was not intended in the Garden of Eden, it came in as a result
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.740]   of sin.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.060]   They are all connected.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:37.420]   You see, when you have people who love the Lord their God with all their heart, soul,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:46.820]   mind, and strength, and we adore Him, and we are affectionate for Him, fellowship happens.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.980]   It happens.
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.160]   You fill a room filled with people who love Jesus.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.140]   You don't have to tell them, "Hey, why don't you talk about this, these three questions.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.340]   Why don't we talk about that today?"
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.460]   You have a room filled with people who love Jesus.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.460]   They're generous.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.420]   They see the needs, they offer.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.880]   We'll do it.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:15.740]   You fill a room filled with people who adore Jesus, you could play music with one guitar,
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:16.740]   tambourine.
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.740]   You have the best worship experience ever.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.380]   You fill a room filled with people who are in love with Christ.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.220]   You can get somebody who's stuttering, who's at least educated in communication, and if
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:42.860]   he mentions Jesus, if he reminds anything about Christ, they want to listen.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:52.420]   So much of what I say right now is contingent upon your heart.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.740]   Now I've learned through the years.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.060]   People come up to me and say, "Oh, you know, I really enjoyed the sermon," and they were
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:06.060]   so affected, and then the same sermon somebody would say, "That was long," or "You yelled
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.620]   a lot."
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:16.100]   And I've come to realize that more than what's happening up here, if you come in with fertile
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:22.040]   hearts to worship God, the Word of God will bear fruit.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:29.180]   If you come in to worship God, you will sing louder, with more passion.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.420]   We don't have to manipulate the lights.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.980]   You don't have to have the best sounding music.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.740]   You don't have the most loudest and the best, beautiful, most vocalist.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:44.060]   Church just happens when you fill it with true worshipers.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:50.180]   That's why all this, like, you and I are so blessed with money, with air conditioning,
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:54.300]   this nice room, with people, with education, with Bible translation.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:52:01.740]   We have all of this, but it also functions as a distraction.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.180]   It functions as a distraction.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:08.540]   That's why sometimes when you travel and you go to a remote part of the world in villages,
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:14.140]   worshiping in a room crammed, 105 degrees, sweating, and you come back thinking, "Wow,
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:20.980]   that was worship," and you want to do that again.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.700]   That's what we want at this church.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.820]   That's what we want.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.660]   I want you to know this Jesus.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:35.460]   I want you to have a relationship with this Jesus.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:40.180]   Not through me, not through the testimonies of other people.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:45.420]   But if somebody asks you, "Who are you?"
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:52.500]   That the first thing that comes out of your mouth is, "I'm a worshiper of Jesus Christ."
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.820]   When was the last time you worshipped him and somebody said, "Wow, you are obsessed
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.140]   with Christ."
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:05.620]   I pray that that would be our testimony more than anything else, that we would be a room
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.140]   filled with people who love Jesus.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:18.620]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:25.700]   Again as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to consider all that we have
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:36.380]   because of his grace, that as a response to that, that we live in worship, and then ultimately
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.700]   that all of this would lead to God's glory, that his name may be magnified.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
