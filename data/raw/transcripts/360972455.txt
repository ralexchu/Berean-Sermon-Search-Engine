[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Alright, we're going to start in a little bit.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.380]   Just a quick apology for those of you guys who messaged me asking specific questions.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.080]   Sometimes I answer, sometimes I don't.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.080]   Apologize.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.920]   If you do ever message me for questions specific to the passage, I'll try to take a look and
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.960]   try to answer to the best of my ability.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.720]   Let's take a moment to pray as we jump into our study tonight.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.560]   Alright, God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.680]   Lord, you give to us such a high calling in scripture as you command us to not simply
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.520]   to do, but also to think, to believe, and to be.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.040]   And we realize, God, that all of that, not just part of that, but every single aspect
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.000]   of that high calling is impossible by our flesh.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.280]   We really do pray for the work of your spirit, the work of your spirit working through the
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   power of your word and your presence in our lives.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.360]   We ask, God, that we would all the more reflect Christ, truly proclaim him with everything
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.720]   that we believe, everything we say and do.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.360]   We really do pray for a fruitful time of Bible study tonight.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   It's in Christ.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   It's in Christ.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   Amen.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   Okay.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.680]   So, let's begin with just reading our passage.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.920]   I know you guys just spent 30 minutes walking over it and things like that, but it's really
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.840]   good to just review, review, review, because the whole process of observation requires
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.920]   that we repeat, repeat, repeat.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.960]   So I read for us here, it says, "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the spirit, if any affection
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.360]   and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.800]   united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, regard one another
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   as more important than yourselves.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.960]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.440]   Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he existed
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.760]   in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.840]   himself taking the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.800]   Being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.360]   of death, even death on a cross.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.720]   For this reason also, God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.640]   every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow of those who are in heaven
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.280]   is Lord, for the glory of God the Father."
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.680]   Okay, what an amazing passage.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.300]   There's just so much to ask and glean from it.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.320]   One of the very first things that we typically do with Bible study is try to outline the
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920]   passage by flow of thought.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.160]   It's so important to not get lost in the details, but to really appreciate the flow of thought
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   that Apostle Paul and the Word of God is teaching us.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   So the way I've phrased it is verse one, it clearly shows condition.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.540]   Condition meaning if this, then that.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.540]   If and then, right?
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.840]   Those are conditional statements.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   If A, then B. And that's pretty much how verse one reads.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   "Therefore if, if there is this and if there's any of that," and so that's why I say verse
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.240]   one is a condition or a basis or a foundation.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.040]   Verse two through five is very clearly the exhortation and command.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.080]   "Make my joy complete by being humbly united.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   Same mind, same love, same spirit, one purpose," right?
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.920]   And that's why I sectioned off verse two through five because as he gave the condition, then
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.440]   the command came.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.960]   And then verse six through 11, it's the prime case, meaning the highest example we could
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.880]   have, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.440]   As he gives us the command, you have this attitude in Jesus who, although he existed
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.200]   in the form of God, dot, dot, dot.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.800]   That is the example for us.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.480]   That's the inspiration.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   That is the case that we're supposed to follow.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.960]   So that's the flow of thought that we find.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   Now let's get into some of the details then and look at verse one.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.480]   Paul says, "Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.200]   love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion."
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.640]   As we take a look at that, I do want to first start off with the "therefore."
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.960]   Now that's pretty, you know, specific.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.200]   We're just looking at the very first word.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.380]   But it's important because it is important to know how does this awesome section where
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.220]   clearly he's giving you the foundation, the command, and the example, where did that come
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.640]   from?
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.800]   How does it connect with the previous passage, previous section that we read?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.040]   And that's something you should think about.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.600]   Hmm, what did he say before?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.520]   And recall that Apostle Paul was giving this grand explanation of his worldview.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.080]   He was giving a grand explanation of how he saw it.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.520]   You guys might think that I'm imprisoned and all these other creatures and so-called individuals
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   and they're just taking this opportunity to be all self-willed, arrogant and stuff.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.560]   Oh my goodness, what are we supposed to do?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.680]   And Paul says, "Well, let me explain my worldview.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   This is joyous."
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   Why?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.640]   Because regardless of the circumstance, Christ is proclaimed.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.880]   And whether life or death, Christ is exalted.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.560]   If that's the case, in this I rejoice.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   Right?
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   That's what he was saying.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.920]   And what he was teaching us was that his proper perspective in the faith and his devotion to
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:25.240]   Christ, then his whole operating principle is that to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.320]   Right?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.920]   And then the way that he ended chapter one was to say, "And you, you do realize you've
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.960]   been given this incredible privilege, that you've been given the grace, granted, right?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.880]   Charisma, granted this incredible privilege to not only just to believe, but to suffer
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   for his sake."
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   Right?
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.440]   So that's an incredible calling.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.760]   That's an incredible perspective.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.120]   And essentially Apostle Paul is saying, "You too."
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   Right?
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.720]   Me, my perspective.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.280]   You, same thing.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   Same high calling.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.440]   And then so if you recall back, one of the passages that we read that was important was
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:16.080]   in chapter one, verse 27, Apostle Paul said, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.800]   of the gospel so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I'll hear of you that
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.640]   you are standing firm, one spirit with one mind, striving together for the faith of the
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   gospel."
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.160]   And so as just a quick summary of all that we just said right there, we realize that
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.640]   there is a connection and a flow of thought that Apostle Paul is thinking.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.160]   There is a same spirit, same mind, same faith, not only just amongst yourselves, but all
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.760]   of us in the gospel, including who?
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.160]   Apostle Paul.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   Right?
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.800]   There is this connection as he's explaining his worldview of the joy that Christ has exalted
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.040]   in me, in my life, in my body, and even my death.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.640]   You've got the same thing.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   The same spirit, same mind, same faith.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   Okay?
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.360]   And so therefore, he starts to ask all these conditional, not ask, but state these conditional
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   phrases.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.880]   Now remember that whenever we do Bible study observation, if you see a list, if you see
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.320]   some repetitive thought, it's very important for you to think like, "Okay, clearly he's
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.280]   taking one thought and then he's putting all these different statements to support that,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.440]   or at least examples of it, or at least the nuances of it."
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.240]   Well, what's really interesting is he says, "If there is any this, and if there is any
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.840]   that, and if there is any of this, and if there is any of that."
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   Right?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.720]   And clearly when you see that, what you should be thinking is, "Hmm.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:52.120]   When I think of the if this, then that, he is laying just a simple basis and foundation.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.220]   This should be kind of like a prerequisite.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.920]   This should be kind of like the condition upon which we operate."
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.080]   That's the kind of thought that comes to mind.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.560]   The way I'd like to put it is this is the common powerful condition for all of us.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.680]   Right?
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.840]   This is the powerful foundation on which he's going to give the exhortation.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.160]   And so one of the questions that I have for you there in the observation is that we should
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.520]   be asking was, "Okay, I do see the statements that are repetitive.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   What's the similarity?"
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   Okay?
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.640]   And I hope you guys got to kind of think through that a little bit.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.000]   Is there a common factor?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.080]   Sometimes there isn't.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.200]   Sometimes it's just like a litany of commands like, "Do this, do that, do this, do this."
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   You know?
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.600]   But here, is there a common sentiment?
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.560]   Now one of the things kind of interestingly is this.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.720]   If you're about to give some really heavy commandments about, you know, there's so many
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.160]   commandments in there about not being prideful, like empty conceit, not being selfish, not
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.840]   being so self-interested and looking out for yourself, that kind of stuff, you know, you
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.800]   would think like maybe he was saying, "You know, we committed to this.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.160]   We're all in the same army."
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.960]   You know, like, but actually the kind of terms that we see here are a little bit more, I
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   guess, encouraging.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.080]   It's a bit more, there's a sense of emotive kind of sentiment to all this.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.960]   Because look, he says, "If there is encouragement, if there is consolation," or, you know, in
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.440]   other translations, "comfort, fellowship of the Spirit, affection, and compassion."
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.560]   Right?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.680]   So as you guys thought through, what are some of the similarities in this?
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.600]   You know, take a moment to think about that even further.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.640]   Hmm, that's true.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   If you're about to exhort people to, you know, "Let's do this," right?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.840]   Is this the way that you would frame it?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.400]   So as we think about this, we do recognize, we recall back that the Philippians' church,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.640]   many of them, clearly Apostle Paul said, "I'm proud of you because you are experiencing
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.720]   the same stuff."
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.760]   Are they experiencing different kind of persecution and suffering?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.040]   Absolutely.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:13.120]   So here and now, we start thinking, okay, for the believer, for the people who have
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.200]   if this is true of you, one of the defining marks of a Christian is that even in the midst
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.880]   of those sufferings, you know what?
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.440]   In life, I got all my stuff that I was working for taken away.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.880]   Or maybe you feel like, you know what?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.320]   I actually tried and tried and in the end, everybody thinks I'm just like pitiful.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.120]   My life isn't really winning at anything.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.920]   For the Christian, you should be able to have your mind and heart still yet be encouraged,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.560]   right?
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.680]   If you come to a point where you look at your life and you realize, like, "I'm not where
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   I ought to be.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.400]   I'm not where everybody else is," and your mind can't get to, "Well, if I have Christ,
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.720]   I have consolation.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.160]   I have comfort.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.160]   I have encouragement.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.120]   I have hope."
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.480]   If your heart and your mind can't get there, then there should be a question like, "How
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   can you say then you actually have faith in Christ?"
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   Right?
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.800]   So although that might be a little bit, maybe some people might think a little bit insensitive,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.040]   we do, again, live in a generation where people are looking at their lives and feeling incredibly
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.620]   unsatisfied, incredibly disappointed, and very, very jaded.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.680]   But if we as Christians buy into that narrative, we're, "Oh, goodness.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   Everything is horrible.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.280]   It's just going down the drain and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," without a sentiment of
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.660]   hope and joy that I can pull out, not because a circumstance has anything, but because my
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.120]   heart has Christ.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.560]   That is the genuine kind of blessing, the powerful basis, and the condition that we
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.040]   have as believers.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   Right?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   Okay.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.320]   So then, in summary of that, I'd like to say there is this common powerful condition, and
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.480]   what's more, we then have a genuine Christian affection.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:08.160]   We have the commonality of the comfort of Christ to those who do live in a broken world.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   Okay?
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.340]   All right.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:22.880]   So then, from that, I do want to make a quick, quick challenge, a quick, quick kind of perspective.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:35.960]   I think that one of our common tendencies is to naively think that certain things can
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.100]   be accomplished without just simply some of these, like, personal affection experiences
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.100]   in Christ.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.100]   Okay?
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.280]   In my mind, as an executive pastor, there are a lot of times where people send me articles
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.800]   about how to do church, what church should be like, and people have lots of opinions.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:01.760]   I appreciate that because I want to regularly be thinking about how to improve our community.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760]   Okay.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:09.360]   Now, as I set that up, sometimes, however, people have all these advice of how to organize
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.640]   people groups, how to make sure that, you know, the like affinity are held together,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.000]   how people get an opportunity to talk.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.920]   All that stuff is actually pretty good stuff.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:26.800]   But I do want you to remember that not just church, but even your work, even your club
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.520]   sports, even your social clubs, even – like, whatever it is you're involved with.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:39.200]   My personal belief is without the affection of Jesus Christ, without the power of Christ's
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.040]   comfort in your heart and the eternal hope that he's giving you, not just church, none
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.360]   of it's possible.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.840]   Every single one of you, if you do not have that kind of comfort, encouragement, consolation
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.860]   of love, fellowship of the spirit, and affection in your heart, you're not able to do anything.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.280]   After the honeymoon – I mean, for those of you guys who have been in work for a really
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.800]   long time, you guys know, all it takes, even at work, if – let's say you found the greatest
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.440]   job that fulfills your sense of like, this is my skill and trade, like, I get to flourish
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.880]   in this.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.700]   Maybe you are working super hard to get to a certain position.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.160]   All it takes is like one jerk co-worker to ruin it all, okay?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.000]   All it takes is one moment where you fail, you mess up.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.880]   It just – it doesn't take much for a group to just unravel.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   Even social clubs that are based on commonalities, whether it be sports, like I'm in part of
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.160]   basketball club, I'm in part of like, I don't know, recently there's a ping pong club, right?
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.440]   You can come together on one common purpose or whatever it may be, and everyone feels
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   like I have ownership in this, I'm responsible, I have a title, I have this and that.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.840]   All of those are good, good things.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:16:01.120]   But without this affection for Christ, not just church, any organization, it's impossible
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.280]   to stay united.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.720]   Why?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.440]   Because soon even within sports clubs, you realize that guy is not in the community,
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.280]   he's my competition.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.120]   Soon you'll realize the commonality that you have in work, everyone's trying to accomplish
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.280]   their own goal.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.200]   Those of you who have been in work, you see it.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.380]   You see it.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.560]   People have their own agendas, they have their own ambitions.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:30.920]   Only when there is a powerful work of Christ that is a supernatural embedded hope in your
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.740]   heart is any of that possible.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.160]   And that's why I think when Apostle Paul is ready to give the command, "I want you to
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.540]   be united and sane in mind, spirit," he doesn't base it off of, "You know, it's so glad that
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.040]   you guys are in close proximity, and I'm so glad you guys have satellite sites."
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.440]   You know, like satellite locations where you guys can come together.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.640]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.200]   I get all this advice about how to structure everything, but in the end it comes back to
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.800]   this.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   The ground basis of our Christianity in my affection for Jesus.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.720]   All the other advice, great, it's good advice.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.280]   It does not compare to the powerful commonality we have in Christ, amen?
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   All right.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.720]   Okay, then we can move on to the command section.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.520]   Okay, then we can move on to the command section.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   Apostle Paul says, "Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.840]   love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose."
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.960]   Now what's really interesting about this is, again, you're like, "Oh gosh, I want to challenge
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   you.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.600]   I can't go through every single one of these things."
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.200]   As a matter of fact, even in verse one, I want to encourage you guys, sit there and
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.160]   ask, "What is the encouragement of Christ?
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   What is the consolation of love?"
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.200]   Is it just a small little consolation prize?
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.720]   Is it more than that?
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.040]   You should be asking these questions.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   What is this?
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.440]   For every single element, but we just don't have time for that.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.000]   Here and now too, we don't have time to go over every single element, but we clearly
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.960]   see perhaps, perhaps a unified theme.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.880]   And the way that I would like to describe it is a little bit, it takes a little bit
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.440]   of work on the word study.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.680]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:27.560]   Apostle Paul uses this interesting phrase, which is called phreno.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:34.440]   When Apostle Paul says, "Be same minded," be like minded, that is the command.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.800]   He's saying, "Make my joy complete," that's the more explicit command, and every single
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.960]   phrase after that is just a participle supporting that, but the commonality is trying to encourage
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.480]   you, "I want you to have the same perspective and worldview.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.600]   I want you to be like minded."
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.520]   And that word is phreno.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.040]   What's really interesting about this is within this passage, Apostle Paul uses it in nuanced
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.880]   ways multiple times.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:09.280]   For example, this word here, "one purpose," this one purpose right here, that's actually
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.920]   the same word.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.880]   And so, in some of your ESV translations, it'll actually say that, "I want you actually
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.360]   to be really in accord with each other in one mind," right?
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.880]   Like fully.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   Why?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:29.280]   Well, here I want to share with you just the definition of it from one of the lexicons,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.040]   the dictionaries, and it says, "This idea has the concept of thoughtful planning, to
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.760]   employ your faculty for thoughtful planning with emphasis upon underlining disposition
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.000]   or attitude, to have this attitude, to think in a particular manner."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.760]   And so, even later on when the command comes in verse five, "The attitude you should have
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.000]   is the one that Jesus Christ has," meaning you need to think like Jesus, right?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.800]   That's the mentality.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   Okay.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.440]   So, what I am trying to actually try to communicate to you guys is, Apostle Paul's command here
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   to be unified, one may think, it's like, "Oh yeah, we need to be really united.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.680]   What a beautiful thing that everyone's here together."
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   He goes deeper than that in his expectations for us.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.040]   He wants us to work together to have actually the same interpretation of the circumstances.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.720]   He wants us to have the same understanding of how God is working these scenarios.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.480]   He wants us to have the same perspective of what's going on, our role, our purpose.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.800]   He wants us to think in like-mindedness.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   Okay.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.600]   Now, that's the part there in verse two.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.320]   The other parts of the command come in negative and positive form.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.040]   The command I think I'd like to summarize as regard one another, but here, let's focus
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.280]   on what we see in verse three and four.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.240]   Apostle Paul says, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit."
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.960]   Ooh, you know, we got to take a moment.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.040]   There's nothing necessarily like nuanced and confusing about it.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.920]   It's just explicit, like, "Don't be selfish, man."
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920]   You know?
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.560]   And he says, "Do not merely look out for your own personal interest."
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.840]   You know, as I think about that, I just took a moment to reflect, and I asked a question
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.400]   like, "Hmm, those things too I know kind of go together as a package."
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.640]   Meaning, when we think about our struggles with sin, when we think about our own struggles
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.000]   with conflict, where there's disunity, typically selfishness and pride go together hand in
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.480]   hand, right?
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.000]   So for example, you know, the way that selfishness goes hand in hand is that if I were to define
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.520]   selfishness, like, what is selfishness?
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.280]   I'd like to summarize it with a statement.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.960]   Whenever you catch yourself say, "What about me?"
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   That's selfishness, right?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.040]   What about me?
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.960]   So for example, if you're on a team, how come that guy gets to shoot?
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.040]   What about me?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.600]   That's selfish.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.160]   Even though maybe you think in your interpretation, it's like, "No, I have proof.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   He shot 30 times.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   I shot twice.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.720]   What about me?"
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.960]   I'm saying that's selfishness.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.520]   When you're on a board meeting, and you have like a, you know, you're at your work, and
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   everybody's chiming in, and you start saying, "Hey, you guys have all these ideas, and you
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.600]   guys get to speak.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.280]   How come no one listens to my ideas?
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   What about me?
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.800]   Did you listen to me?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.920]   Did you consider what I had to say?"
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.080]   The "what about me" is selfishness.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   Maybe in a family, you start thinking like, "How come that guy gets to decide where we
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480]   go to eat?"
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.120]   And then in your family, "How come that person gets to da-da-da-da-da?"
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   The moment you start saying, "What about me?"
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.360]   You are in danger of selfishness.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.720]   Why?
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.920]   Because someone can ask you, "What about you?"
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.200]   Why do you get to start sitting there thinking like that you deserve the opportunity to shoot?
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   Like are you Kobe?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.640]   Are you LeBron?
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.440]   Why is it that everybody asks me to listen to you in the board meeting?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.480]   Like are you the CEO?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.120]   Why is it that in the family, everybody has to eat what you say you have to eat, like
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.240]   that you want to eat?
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   Are you the king of the family?
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.200]   You're like the head honcho?
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.600]   Now you're going to reply, "No, no, I never said that.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.040]   I didn't say I was Kobe.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   I didn't say I was a CEO.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.160]   I didn't say I was the king of this family."
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.680]   But clearly you think, "But I don't deserve this."
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.160]   Right?
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.360]   Clearly you think, "I deserve more than this though."
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.960]   See, I think the reason why pride and selfishness go together is because there is clearly an
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.140]   interpretation in the mind.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.600]   Someone could look at you and say, "But seriously, who do you think you are?"
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.760]   And you say, "What about me?"
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.680]   They'll reply to you, "What about you?
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   Who are you?"
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.320]   And then the Christian, mature Christian, will look at you and say, "But didn't God
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.160]   challenge you to be a slave?
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.840]   Didn't God tell you to be last?
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.680]   Didn't Christ tell you that you'd be blessed when you place others before you?"
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.000]   What a challenge, right?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.080]   What an incredible challenge.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.280]   And so here I think it absolutely makes sense that in contrast to selfishness and then conceit,
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.320]   like pride, Apostle Paul gives the command in a positive form, "You have to do this
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.160]   with humility, regarding one another as more important than yourselves.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.120]   And you have to not merely look out for your own interest, but look out for the interest
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.160]   of others."
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:39.480]   And the exhortation has its full form in have this attitude that is Christ, that is in the
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   Lord.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.720]   And here I want to highlight something for you.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.800]   You see this word attitude?
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.760]   Remember how we gave that definition?
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   That attitude, I mean the word phroneo actually has this mentality of disposition or attitude.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.360]   That term in attitude is the same word.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.680]   So earlier I mentioned to you that phroneo is used multiple times.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.000]   Apostle Paul employs it to kind of encapsulate his exhortation.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.720]   A lot of people think this passage, it's the passage on unity.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:16.240]   I would like to say actually it's the passage on a united mentality that's like Christ.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.360]   Apostle Paul is challenging you to think, to have a posture like Jesus.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.400]   The command is not, "Hey, just put your differences aside.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.440]   Hey, let's try to get together.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   Can we just get along?"
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440]   No, no, no.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.680]   There is something deeper than that where the prerequisite for you to come together
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.440]   is that every single one of us would die to our arrogance and conceit, would die to our
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   selfish interests and have the heart of Christ.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.840]   For us to be united, it requires an incredible level of sanctification.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.480]   It requires an incredible level of putting our own self aside at the back burner so that
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.160]   we put the interest of others first.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.880]   And so I want to challenge us that when it comes to even the hopes of unity, when it
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.140]   comes to the hopes of having a united church, I hope you realize there is an incredible
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.280]   burden on you personally.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.240]   I put in there that there has to be a renewing of the mind.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   You guys remember in Romans chapter 12 where it talks about our acceptable sacrifice unto
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.480]   God, right, that there should be a constant renewing of our mind?
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.240]   I want you to understand if ever you've complained about, let's say, superficiality of the church
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.960]   fellowship, if ever you complained about how there's cliques in this church, if ever you've
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.400]   complained about how people or there's this weird hierarchy, maybe it's because, you know,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.680]   I don't know, like people just love that stuff or whatever it may be, I want you to understand
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.280]   that no just simple twist of the structure, no simple like, "You know what I'm going to
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.280]   do today?
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.680]   I'm going to mix you all up and put you in different small groups," right?
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.160]   None of that kind of small tweak in the church is going to fix a renewing of the mind that
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.560]   needs to take place.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.240]   It requires for every single one of us a constant sanctification where we put aside our selfishness
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.960]   and continue to put on the attitude of Christ, amen?
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.200]   That's a burden for every single one of us.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.800]   So as we think about that, I definitely want you guys, one of the application questions
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.000]   for all you all is simply the question, how is this applied?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.280]   Because man, this is such a huge broad calling, it's a huge broad command and challenge for
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   you.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.840]   And again, we don't have the time to go over every single one of these things.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.960]   When we think about the word, command, regard others, I want you guys to start thinking,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.800]   "Okay, in this specific scenario, how do I apply that?"
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   Whether it be in your work, do you currently have some conflict at work and you're sitting
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.640]   there thinking, "You know what I would like to do?
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   Get a new job."
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.040]   You know, if you're starting to think like that, perhaps God might open the doors for
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.280]   you, fine.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.360]   But did you start thinking of how do I exercise though a humility and a regarding of other
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.640]   individuals more important than me?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   If it's in your family, if it's in your husband and wife relationships, if it's in your friendship,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.160]   how do you have this attitude of Jesus?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.440]   Does it mean that all of a sudden I just like, "You know what?
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.120]   I'm just going to die.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.280]   You can just do whatever you want.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   I have no opinions."
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.360]   Like, does that look genuine to you?
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   No.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.640]   There can be an extreme of that.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.360]   There can be such an extreme where now all of a sudden you're not a slave of Christ,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.760]   you're just a slave of everybody, right?
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.240]   You have no backbone.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.880]   We're not talking about that kind of extreme when we say the negative and positive here.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.440]   So I have to ask you, what is a tangible scenario of how this is applied, right?
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:51.280]   Okay, with that being said, here again, I want to emphasize this idea that Apostle Paul
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:58.600]   uses these various terms with the same Greek word to challenge every one of you.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.160]   For those of you who are frustrated in a current circumstance, remember, the solution is not
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.200]   the whole greener on the other side.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.760]   Remember, it's not always the fault of the circumstance.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.800]   Remember God desires to strengthen you in the inner man by strengthening your perspective
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.640]   and mind, okay?
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.720]   Then we go on.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.280]   We go on to the last portion, moving from the commandment, Apostle Paul gives us the
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.640]   great example.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.840]   And I have two questions to separate the two parts that I see, which is this.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.140]   What did you think, Jesus?
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.920]   And what did you do?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.280]   And this part, you guys, I feel so bad because I'm going to have to go over pretty quickly
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.080]   just for the sake of time and that you guys can discuss, but I'm confident that you guys
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.040]   are going to have a lot of fruitful conversation in this because there's so much.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.920]   What do I mean that there is a what do you think and what do you do, right?
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.580]   Because as we look at Jesus, we first look at what he thought.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:03.120]   If Apostle Paul's commandment was for us to think differently, believe in our minds, and
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:10.040]   have a renewal of how we interpret the world, think about how Jesus thought.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.960]   Take a look at this, okay?
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.320]   This little box should be over regard, okay?
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:25.800]   Who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   be grasped.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Okay?
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.160]   I want you to think about that because a lot of people think like, "Oh, yeah, you know,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.240]   I get it.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.760]   Jesus really came down.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   Incarnation happened.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   It was amazing."
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   Okay?
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:45.480]   What I'd like you to do is think, "How do I appreciate the massive contrast Apostle Paul
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.440]   is painting for us here?
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.880]   How do I appreciate the degree, okay, the incredible degree that God is trying to reveal
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.660]   to us?"
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.920]   Because clearly, Apostle Paul, through this passage, is highlighting and contrasting the
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   form.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.280]   The form of God that he had.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.040]   He existed in the form of God.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.760]   There was an equality with God that he had.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.600]   But then he took on the form of a bond servant.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.160]   He was in the likeness of man.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.840]   He was in the appearance of man.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.520]   And he humbled himself, right?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.960]   Massive contrast.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   Okay.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.400]   I want you to think about everything we've been talking about tonight about the perspective,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.520]   the mind.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:36.400]   What kind of crazy, transformative thinking, powerful thinking did Jesus exercise to show
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.200]   to us his humility?
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.280]   Okay?
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:47.520]   Notice how he says, "Christ did not regard the equality that he had with God as something
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.160]   to be grasped."
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.040]   It means forcefully hold onto.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.560]   If you guys look at your translations, like your Bible has that little letter you click
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.600]   on and it says, "Something to be asserted."
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:06.480]   Jesus did not think in his mind that it was good for him in that moment to hold onto his
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:13.920]   right, to hold onto his equality, and to exercise that equality.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.400]   Think about that.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:22.280]   If you guys have ever, ever been offended by somebody a lot younger than you, let's
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.080]   say 10 years younger, if you've ever been talked down to and diminished and confronted
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.560]   and just, you know, attacked by someone way younger than you, you know what that feels
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   like.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.800]   Where you start feeling like, "Who are you?"
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   Right?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.520]   And then there's that moment when you, you know, we don't never, ever say this, but sometimes
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.720]   you have those moments like, "Do you know who I am?"
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   And that's why those like, dramas that we see where these individuals like undercover
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.040]   boss or people have this crazy conflict and all of a sudden they reveal like, "I'm the
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   owner!"
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.840]   You know, like those moments are really like dramatic and it's fun to watch because we
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.520]   sometimes fantasize about that.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.480]   To be able to just own somebody, "Do you know who I am?"
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.840]   They're like, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize."
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.060]   You know?
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.960]   But you realize like what this passage is talking about.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:21.760]   Jesus did not regard the quality of God as something to be used and preserved and held
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   onto.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.520]   That's crazy.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.440]   And so when I think about the degree to which we should appreciate the model, the example
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.120]   of His humility, I'm almost not able to even describe it right now.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.440]   You know, like I don't know how to put that into words.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.000]   And then we start thinking about the actual action.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.280]   That not only would He empty Himself, I mean, some of us are really proud, it's like, "I
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   humble myself today.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.440]   I bit my lip and didn't say a word to that fool that, you know, he thought he knew better
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   than me at work.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.440]   I held my tongue.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.440]   Yeah."
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.680]   You're all proud of your little humble accomplishment.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.320]   But man, He says He emptied Himself.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.960]   He took on the form of a man, appearance of this flesh and then He became obedient to
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:12.240]   the point of death, even unto the cross.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:20.480]   Most shameful statement of the criminals who would be deserving of such shame, right?
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:27.200]   I mean, just think about the degree and the chasm that we're supposed to appreciate in
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   this.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:34.240]   And so for us, when we think about the example of humility, I mean, understand that the heart
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.880]   of appreciation for this is going to have the sufficient power to humble ourselves.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.800]   And what's more, Apostle Paul says, oh, I'm sorry, I just went over all that stuff.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:54.600]   In verse 9, "For this reason then, to what Christ has thought and did, God has highly
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:01.640]   exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.320]   Jesus every knee will bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.000]   and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.440]   And I ask you this interesting question on the observation part of the beginning portion.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.960]   Is this still an example for us?
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.720]   Clearly, Apostle Paul said this is the condition and the basis of the command I'm giving.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   This is the command.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.160]   You better have the attitude of Jesus, this humble, sacrificial, emptying heart of Jesus,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   right?
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:37.920]   And then he says, "And this, to this, therefore God is exalted."
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.800]   And the answer to that is, of course.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:47.720]   The only way you are going to empty yourself is for you to have the same thought of Christ.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.240]   Let me ask you, did Jesus Christ know that God was going to exalt Him?
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   Yes.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.640]   Do you guys remember the Hebrews chapter 1 portion?
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.440]   Did Jesus Christ entrust Himself to God every time He was being persecuted, whipped, and
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   beaten?
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440]   Yes.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.320]   Scripture actually explicitly says Jesus Christ did not reply in vengeance.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.480]   He didn't respond to the accusations.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   Why?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.360]   Because He kept entrusting Himself to the Father.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.920]   Likewise for every single one of us, the only way we're going to be able to humble ourselves
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.600]   to that degree, do you trust this?
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.240]   Do you trust that when you empty yourself, that in the heart of God, what God desires
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.840]   to see, what He honors, is this kind of noble humility?
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   The kind of humility He sees in His own Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.840]   As a reference for you, I want to turn to 1 Peter chapter 5.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.280]   Scripture says, Apostle Peter says, "And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.720]   the unfading crown of glory.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.920]   You younger men likewise be subject to your elders, and all of you clothe yourself with
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.640]   humility toward one another."
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   How are we going to do that?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.120]   How are we going to do that when that guy is incompetent?
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.200]   How are we going to do that when he acts like he knows more than me when clearly I know
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   more?
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.380]   How are we going to do that when that guy has malicious intent and here I am just receiving
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.560]   the brunt end of this?
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.640]   How am I going to do that when all this stuff is going wrong?
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.040]   How am I going to do that in that scenario?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.360]   How am I going to do that in this scenario?
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:27.120]   Well, he says, "God, God is opposed to the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.000]   Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you at the proper
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.920]   time.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.960]   Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you."
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.340]   The challenge today was for you to exercise the mentality and the attitude of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:52.720]   It is incredible that Christ would humble Himself to such a degree where Christ Himself
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.160]   depended and trusted on His Father to this level.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.160]   And that's the exact same path and example we should follow as well.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   Amen?
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.120]   Lord God, we want to thank You so much.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:17.940]   God, Lord, words cannot express because truthfully speaking, our limited minds cannot comprehend
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:24.860]   the incredible degree to which You humbled Yourself, the incredible degree to which You
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:32.620]   purposely intentionally loved, and how You volitionally sacrificed and emptied Yourself.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:38.020]   But God, we see in part, we want to see in full, but we see in part, and we thank You
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.260]   so much that You show us.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.980]   And we know, Father God, that You call us, that You desire and command for us to have
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.020]   the same attitude.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.300]   And Lord, we want to respond with, "Yes, Lord, we want to."
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.460]   We pray, Father God, that by Your Spirit and by Your Word, You would help us.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.420]   And Lord, we pray that through that, through the sanctification of our hearts, God, that
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:05.160]   You would continue to build this church to be a powerful proclamation of Christ because
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.420]   of the wonderful unity born out of a fruit of humble hearts.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.420]   We thank You, Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   In Your name we pray.
