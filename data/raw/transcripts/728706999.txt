[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1, and I'll be reading from
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.160]   verse 76 to verse 80.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.040]   Luke chapter 1, verse 76 to verse 80.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.320]   And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go on before
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.560]   the Lord to prepare His ways, to give to His people the knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.040]   of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God, with which the sunrise from on
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.520]   high will visit us, to shine upon those who sit in darkness in the shadow of death, to
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   guide our feet into the way of peace.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.120]   And a child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the desert
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.360]   until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.480]   Father, we thank you so much for being gracious and patient with us.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.880]   Help us, Lord God, to understand your word more than just knowledge, that you would convict
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.000]   our hearts through your word.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.560]   Bring us, Lord God, to peace, repentance, to great joy, celebration, and to worship.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840]   Guide us and lead us.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.240]   Open our ears that we may understand.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.720]   You know, years ago, those of you guys who are on the seasoned fellowship, right, when
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.240]   we were younger, Chinese medicine was almost considered a joke.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.480]   You remember how people saw sushi, right?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.480]   Do you remember that?
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.600]   Like, if they said, "Oh, you eat raw fish," and now everybody stands in line to get the
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   omakase, right?
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.240]   They got to pay a lot of money to sit there.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240]   Remember when we were younger?
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.800]   It was like a, "Oh my gosh, you eat raw fish," right?
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.040]   How time has changed, right?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   There's a lot of things like in the, in particular, Chinese culture, because there's 3,000 years
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.020]   of observation.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.920]   And so, you know, when we were younger, Chinese medicine is just like, "Oh," from a poor country,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.480]   at least at that time.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.820]   And so they didn't take it seriously, but as now medicine has progressed, and the more
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.720]   in the medical field, they're looking more deeply into the Chinese medicine, because
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.920]   they know there's certain things that they may not have understood 30, 40 years ago,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.000]   but now it's starting to make sense.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   So they're kind of trying to decide for what to take serious and what to not take serious.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.080]   And, you know, anything that you observe for thousands of years, obviously, that's something
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.960]   that we need to pay attention to, because even if we don't understand it, clearly there's
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.180]   some wisdom behind it that we may not be able to comprehend.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.860]   If it's been around for thousands of years, there must be a reason behind that, right?
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.220]   In the same way, there's things that we observe, right?
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.860]   Whether it's 10 years, 20 years, or maybe during our lifetime, there are certain principles
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.340]   that you see that are consistent.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.540]   And I remember one of the things that my mom used to say when I was a young pastor, and
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.020]   she would say, "You know, sometimes the people that are harder to get to know end up sticking
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.300]   around in your life longer, and then the people who warm up really quick, they end up getting
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.140]   cold really quick too."
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.580]   You know, and when I was younger, I heard that, you know, you just kind of hear it,
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.580]   and it's like, "Oh, okay," you know.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.840]   But as time has gone by, you know, again, this is from her observation from many years
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.540]   of ministry, and I can say, like, that's one of the truths that I remember, you know, that
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.940]   sometimes we can give up on relationships easily because it's harder to get to know,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.980]   and sometimes some of the best relationships are relationships that take time to develop,
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.980]   you know.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.580]   So there's all of you probably, as you get older, you have certain things that you may
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.220]   have heard, and it's proven to be true, and you become more and more reliant on that as
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.700]   you get older.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.280]   I say all of this because there's things in the Scripture that we read that is like, "Seek
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.640]   ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you," and when
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.000]   you first hear it, you have a hard time believing that and practicing that because, you know,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.240]   there's consequences to this, but if you've lived by that principle for many years, you
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.080]   know how accurate that is.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.400]   You know how consistent God is.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.120]   And not just that, everything that God says, if you've been, the longer that you walk with
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.400]   the Lord consistently, you know that what He says is proven to be true.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.080]   You know, so a lot of times we look at Scripture and it's like, "Well, what are the archaeological
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   evidence?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.520]   You know, what are the fulfilled prophecies and, you know, the manuscripts?"
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   And we look at all of this stuff, but really the best evidence is the Bible itself.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   The longer you gaze into it, the longer you walk in it and you practice it, you realize
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.660]   like, "Wow, there's nothing more truer than what the Scripture says."
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.760]   So the more we practice it, the more we observe it, the more we study it, the longer that
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.160]   we've been walking with the Lord, it's not because there's some brand new truth.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.680]   It's just that the things that we've known, it's just proven over and over and over, and
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.720]   there's no way a human being could have written this.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.160]   When we look at the fulfilled prospecy that what we talked about last week, we said, you
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.520]   know, I don't know how much of you really understood what I was saying last week, but
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.920]   again, even if you didn't understand it, it's important enough that hopefully that kind
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.960]   of tickled your mind to cause you to look into it deeper because the promise that God
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.920]   made to Abraham 4,000 years ago is the same promise that he is continuing to fulfill.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.400]   He made this promise and a thousand years go by before the nation has ever developed,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.800]   and you would think people are like, "What?
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   Thousand years went by?
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   He didn't fulfill his promise."
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.360]   And yet he shows up and he says, "I'm going to fulfill this," and gives a Davidic covenant,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.720]   and then another thousand years passes by, and then the angel said, "It's because of
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.440]   the promise that God made to Abraham.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.680]   That's why Jesus is here."
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.400]   Then 2,000 years have gone by since then, and then we see in the book of Revelation
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.840]   how he's going to fulfill all of this and the glory that is coming.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.880]   And so for thousands and thousands of years, the promise that he made, he never forgot.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.680]   And over and over again, from generation to generation, hundreds and hundreds of years,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.600]   he is consistently remembering.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.200]   So every time, whether it's a hundred years later or a thousand years later, he continues
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.240]   to repeat back, "Because I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because of the covenant
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.560]   that I have made, that I will be faithful to myself, that I will seek my glory in keeping
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.760]   my promise."
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.520]   And even though our life may be short, that we only experience maybe, if you live long,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.880]   a hundred years, right?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.040]   Most of us probably not, right?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.080]   But even if we live long during that hundred years, we see that.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.320]   We see how, what God promised, he does.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.480]   He does.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.280]   God is not man that he should lie, nor the Son of Man that he should repent.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520]   Has he not said, and will he not do it?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.240]   And over and over again, right?
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.020]   So if there's anything that I have more confidence today is in the Word of God, right?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.020]   Everything changes.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   Generation changes.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.240]   We don't know what movement is going to come next.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   You know, social justice movement, the gospel movement, the reform movement, the charismatic
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.680]   movement, right?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.640]   The discipleship movement, the holiness movement, and we have movements that come and they go,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.820]   but the Word of God stays consistent, the same, today, yesterday, and forevermore.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.500]   And that's why we can have confidence that we can get involved with various things that
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.960]   are coming in our generation, but I guarantee you, 10 years from now, you're going to look
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   back at that, it's like, "Oh, you got caught up in this."
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.400]   And another 10 years from now, it's like, "Oh, it's gone and it's not in people's psyches
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   anymore."
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.480]   But we're going to stick to the Word of God, right?
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   Nothing that we say, nothing that we do from this Word, you're going to look back at it
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.360]   50 years later, it's like, "I wish I didn't do that."
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.560]   You're going to see how it's proven more and more and more.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.880]   All of this, again, is an introduction to the text that we're looking at, starting from
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.320]   verse 76, because now God, 2,000 years after he made his promise, he is going to fulfill
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.700]   a portion of that.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.240]   The central portion of his promise through the Messiah that's coming, specifically through
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.040]   his servant, John.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.680]   And in this praise, this prophecy from Zachariah, there's two things that is clarified for us
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   of his ministry.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.060]   One, his call, right?
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.600]   What is he called to do?
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.560]   And two, what is his message?
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.420]   So that's pretty much the outline of what we're going to be covering this morning.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.200]   What is John's call and what is his message?
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.240]   One, he is the prophet, it says, of the Most High God.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.440]   Now today, 2,000 years removed, we had the New Testament written for us, we have prophecy
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.560]   of the Old Testament.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.080]   We read that and said, "Oh, he's a prophet of the Most High God."
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.920]   But you have to remember, when this is prophesied, all the Jews who heard this knew exactly what
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.880]   was going on because there were how many years of silence?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   Four hundred years.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.680]   The last time God sent the prophet was 400 years.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.880]   So nobody in that generation ever heard a prophet before.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   There's not a single person who is alive who heard directly from the prophet of God.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   Four hundred years of complete silence.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.920]   Book of Amos was warning the nation of Israel that if you continue to rebel against God,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.560]   there's going to come a famine in the land, but it's not going to be the famine of food
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   or water.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.200]   He said, "It's going to be a famine of the Word of God."
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.840]   In other words, God's going to withdraw his spirit, he's going to withdraw his servants,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.120]   and you're going to be staggering from place to place looking to hear from God, he said,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.360]   but you will not hear it because as a judgment against Israel, he said he's going to withhold
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   his word.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.960]   Now, you may look at that and say, "Well, how does he withhold his word?"
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:10.120]   Because they had the word, they had this transcription, right?
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.920]   I mean, they might not have it the way that we have it now, but they had access to that.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.160]   So does it mean that God was going to hide his scroll so that people wouldn't know what
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   it says?
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   Possibly.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.960]   But when he says he's not, he's going to stop speaking, he's not simply talking about,
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.600]   you're not going to have the written word to go and examine.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.080]   There's a huge difference between what a prophet does.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   A priest is an individual who stands before God and before man, and he represents God
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.280]   to the people and people to God.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.600]   So he's a mediator in between through the sacrificial system to kind of stand in between
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.560]   to help this relationship.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:58.040]   A prophet is a man who has been ordained to represent God to the people, specifically.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.400]   He's not simply a scribe.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.760]   He's not an individual who simply studies the scripture and then interprets it.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.040]   "Oh, this is what Leviticus means.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   This is what Numbers means.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.280]   This is what the prophets mean."
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.760]   That's not a prophet.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.680]   That's just an interpreter.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.880]   That's just somebody who's regurgitating information that he gained through study.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.680]   In fact, one of the biggest rebukes during the time of Christ is to the scribes and the
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.640]   Pharisees who knew the scripture, but they weren't speaking for God.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.400]   A prophet is an individual who has a direct message from God to give.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.840]   So typically in our generation, when we say prophet, we think of somebody who's foretelling
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.960]   the future, somebody who prophesies saying, "Tomorrow this is going to happen.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.120]   Next year this is going to happen.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.520]   You should marry this person or that person."
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   And not to say that that isn't part of the definition, but the bigger definition of what
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.520]   a prophet is, is simply an individual who's directly speaking as a mouthpiece of God.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:02.640]   So John, being the first prophet in 400 years, as he is saying, and the reason why this is
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.040]   being declared is basically telling the people to listen.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.120]   This is not just an interpreter.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.400]   He's not just giving you knowledge.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.600]   It's not giving you tradition.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.560]   God is now breaking through history.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.060]   Now he's going to be speaking to you.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.360]   And the whole reason why he's doing that is obviously for the reason why he's speaking,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.680]   to listen to him.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:29.880]   But by definition of what a prophet is, a prophet must first know God.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.520]   A prophet must first know God.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:40.640]   And you know, you know the difference between simple interpretation versus proclamation.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.920]   Interpretation basically is if I spent enough time studying and expositing and dissecting,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.000]   I can tell you what it says.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.400]   You can learn it.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.360]   You can dissect it and say, "Oh, that's what that means."
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.400]   A prophet's call is not simply to represent the Word of God, but his heart.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   See, if a prophet doesn't understand the heart of God, you can speak the Word of God to the
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.960]   wrong people at the wrong time.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   You can tell somebody, "Peace, peace," when there is no peace.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.840]   Well, does the Bible talk about peace?
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   Of course the Bible talks about peace.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.420]   And you can take that word and then apply it to people who may need rebuke.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.000]   Or you can take a passage in there where people need the grace of God, and you've taken the
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.160]   Word of God and you applied it to the wrong people at the wrong time.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.960]   So a prophet is not simply somebody who is expositing the text.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.520]   A prophet, first and foremost, must know God.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.400]   That's why it says at the end in verse 80, right, after this proclamation happened, he's
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.960]   born, and at the end it says he was out in the desert.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.360]   And this is a common theme that we see in the Bible when God is preparing people for
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.920]   ministry.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.160]   Whether it was Joseph, he wasn't in maybe literal desert, but he was in a form of a
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   desert.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   He was completely isolated.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.360]   Moses, right, he had to be prepared for the great work that God is calling him to do.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.080]   The nation of Israel wandered in the desert to prepare them to get into the promised land.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:16.240]   You see, Elijah, Jeremiah, Apostle Paul himself, after he gets converted, he's out in the desert
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.680]   for 12 years.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.800]   And so before God can speak through the man, God has to speak to the man.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.440]   Let me make that clear.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.080]   Expository preaching isn't just telling you the words because I can just give you the
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.900]   commentary.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:41.420]   Someone who is speaking on behalf of God must also know the heart of God and be able to
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.980]   know who he is to be able to speak on his behalf.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.380]   And that's what John was.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.620]   John was the prophet of the most high God.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.820]   In other words, to pay attention.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:56.140]   And the reason why they were highlighting who he is, he says, in order for him to prepare
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.620]   his way.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.100]   And this was a direct fulfillment of that prophecy in Malachi chapter 3, 1.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   It says, "Behold, I am going to send my messenger, and he will clear the way before me, and the
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.020]   Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.020]   whom you delight.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.220]   Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts."
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.180]   And again, this declaration of who he is, the prophet of the most high God, is a direct
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.300]   fulfillment of Malachi 3, 1.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:27.640]   Four hundred years later, four hundred years later, God is breaking his silence in order
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.300]   to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:36.700]   In Mark chapter 1, verse 3, Mark declares about John the Baptist a little bit more specific
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.700]   prophecy.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.540]   He says, "The voice of the one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord,
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.860]   make his path straight."
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.300]   And that is a specific fulfillment of Isaiah 43 to 4.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.140]   Isaiah 43 to 4, in reference to John the Baptist, it says, "A voice is calling, 'Clear the way
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.500]   for the Lord in the wilderness.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.660]   Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.860]   Let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low, and let the rough ground
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.260]   become a plain, and the rugged terrain a broad valley."
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.940]   Now, when you don't understand the context of this, you read that and say, "Okay, prepare
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.860]   the best road."
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.180]   And that was John's call.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:22.220]   John's call was to prepare the best road so that when Christ comes, the access to him
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.260]   would be paved.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.000]   But there's something so much more going on here than just building right roads, because
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.300]   any Jew at that culture would have known that this is in reference to the city of refuge.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:39.500]   The same language is used to describe how to prepare and set up these six separate cities,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.460]   cities of refuge.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.940]   And the whole purpose of these cities of refuge that God commanded the nation of Israel was
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.580]   to set it upon a hill where everybody can see.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.760]   So they're all spread out.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.180]   So if you were standing anywhere in Israel, you could look up and see one of these cities
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.140]   from where you were at.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:03.520]   And God said that the best roads, the best road in the nation of Israel, all are roads
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.600]   that lead to the cities of refuge.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.460]   So obviously, this is very significant.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.420]   Of all the things that God told them to do, I mean, think about the amount of time, the
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.400]   energy, and money, and manpower that must have gone in building this city up on the
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.100]   top and then cutting down mountains and hills.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.740]   And if there's valleys to fill it up.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   Now why did he create that?
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.340]   What is the significance of this?
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:39.060]   He said specifically, if a man accidentally kills somebody, that one of their family members
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:44.400]   called the blood avenger, he would get angry because he wants to take vengeance, even if
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.260]   it was an accident.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.740]   And so in order to protect that person, they built the best road so that he can run to
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.240]   these cities of refuge and find refuge.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:59.220]   So once he get into the gate, the high priest, who is the master over these cities, would
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.080]   basically bring him under his protection.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.580]   So the avenger of blood that is chasing after him cannot come into the city.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.540]   And as long as the high priest lives, he is safe.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.980]   And so all of these cities were made specifically for that purpose.
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.360]   Think about it.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.140]   How often do you think that happened?
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.740]   The best roads, all that time and energy was built.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.220]   How often do you think somebody killed by accident was running for their lives and that
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:32.580]   for those people that he created these specific cities all over Israel?
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.780]   My guess is every once in a while.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.100]   So you can look at that and say, you did all of that?
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.860]   Just so that every once in a while, maybe every few years, something might happen by
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.500]   accident and you created this whole system for that purpose?
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.780]   Clearly it wasn't simply to protect those people, even though that's what it said.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:59.820]   Imagery of the city of refuge is a clear reference to the coming of Christ, that he is our high
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:07.580]   priest and the best roads that leads to Christ are the ones that lead to the city of refuge.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:14.740]   So when John is called to say to fulfill this, to cut down the mountains and fill the valleys,
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.960]   it's a clear reference to the fulfillment of the city of refuge, that Christ is coming.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.140]   And that's exactly what he has been called to do, to prepare the way.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.140]   And that's exactly what the gospel does.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.180]   It takes those who are high and humbles them.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.640]   And it takes those who are low and then gives them hope.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.720]   It is not by accident.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.420]   I've mentioned this before, that the gospel of John chapter three begins by the introduction
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.420]   of Nicodemus.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:49.420]   John chapter three, Nicodemus comes and he is a member of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee of
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.420]   Pharisees.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.740]   He's basically a superstar in the nation of Israel.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.880]   Scripture says that he comes to Jesus at night because he's concerned about his reputation,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.700]   because many of his friends are saying that maybe Jesus is not the Messiah.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.380]   We got to get rid of this guy.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.940]   And Nicodemus is curious because he thinks that this is not a normal man.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:14.760]   So he comes for his own safety at night.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.900]   And he has this encounter with Jesus and Jesus basically, and you would think if he was Nicodemus
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.860]   is that, you know what, I obeyed all the laws.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.760]   I'm a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.740]   He probably thought that if he met the Messiah, that Christ would say, you know what, good
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.260]   and faithful servant, you're going to have the first seat in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:38.820]   But Jesus says, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven until you are born again.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.820]   Born again.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.820]   How do you do that?
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.380]   I've done everything that God told me to do.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.220]   So what do you mean born again?
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.320]   He said, you cannot enter the kingdom.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.460]   So if you look at that encounter, Jesus basically humbles this man because he thought he was
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.600]   sitting on the top and he says, no, you have to start over.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.140]   The very next chapter, he runs into a Samaritan woman and the Samaritan woman is embarrassed
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.180]   for Jesus.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.700]   Jesus is engaging her.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.540]   All the disciples are out and trying to gather some stuff.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.220]   And the Samaritan woman basically asked Jesus, how can you being a Jewish rabbi talk to a
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.820]   Samaritan woman in the middle of the day?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.360]   And she was probably there because she was an adulteress.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.460]   And so she's embarrassed.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.300]   Even her own Samaritan neighbors probably shunned her.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.580]   That's why she was there in the middle of the day.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.820]   And she's concerned for Jesus.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.740]   And Jesus deliberately encounters her.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:37.220]   And at the end of this encounter where Jesus reveals himself to her, she drops everything.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.980]   She forgets, she runs and she becomes the first evangelist, goes back home and tells
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.060]   the other Samaritans, come here, man, who told me everything about my life.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:51.940]   It is not by accident that you have this Nicodemus who's sitting up on the top of the hill where
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.320]   God just said, you're going to chop this down.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.220]   And you have this woman who's sitting in the valley thinking she's not worthy of even a
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.500]   Jewish rabbi talking to her in the middle of the day.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.740]   And God brings her up.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.020]   You see, the gospel brings people who are proud.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.300]   We have a generation of people who think that when they die, that their good works is good
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   enough.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.020]   I've done enough.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.140]   I'm not a bad person.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.660]   I paid my taxes.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.980]   And I was a good citizen and raised good kids.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   And I didn't steal.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.980]   I didn't murder.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.260]   I drove the speed limit.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.800]   And so as a result of that, when I die, God's going to be fair.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.500]   The gospel humbles people who are thinking that their self-righteousness is somehow going
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.420]   to get into the kingdom of God.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:46.660]   And then there's people who are so seeped in their mistakes and their sins that God
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.140]   cannot possibly forgive their sins.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.300]   You don't know what I've done.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.460]   You don't know how far I've gone.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.780]   And God speaks to them and brings them up.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:05.540]   So that same path that leads to Christ is the same door for Nicodemus and the Samaritan
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.540]   woman.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:17.020]   See, if our preaching only addresses the haughty and it only addresses the lowly, that's not
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.100]   God.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.500]   You don't pick a prophet just doesn't pick and choose and say, "You know what?
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.540]   My whole goal in life is to humble people, so I'm going to preach harshness and judgment
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.620]   of God because that's what I'm going to do."
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.100]   Or you err on the other side.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   You know what?
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.540]   There's too many people hurting.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.100]   I don't want to discourage them.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.740]   So I'm going to have to just encourage them.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.180]   You come to church, you always be encouraged.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.440]   Either is not from God because God lowers the mountain and raises the valley.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.640]   And that's what John the Baptist was called to do, to prepare the way.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.840]   That's why when the Pharisees came thinking that, "Oh, he's the Messiah.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Let's go to him."
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.880]   He says, "Repent and bear fruit according to repentance."
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.240]   And he humbles them.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.800]   And that's why they turn against him.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.560]   And then he goes to the sinners, the prostitutes, the tax collectors, people that have been
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.420]   shunned, would have never been accepted into the Jewish society.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.760]   And he starts hanging with them and make some of them his disciples.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.880]   And he raises them up.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.200]   He was sent for that purpose.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.140]   His whole purpose of ministry is to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.360]   But what was his message?
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.880]   His message is to proclaim the knowledge of salvation.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.800]   To proclaim the knowledge of salvation.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.960]   Now let me stop right here and to explain why this is so important.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.200]   Because you notice here he doesn't say he came to save people.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.560]   He has no power to save people.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.160]   His job was to proclaim the knowledge of salvation.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.000]   You know why this is so important?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.160]   Like people, part of the reason why we are timid in evangelism is because we think that
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.920]   somehow we have to save them.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.120]   And so we end up targeting people that we think that we're able to save.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.960]   Weaker people, broken people, people who are lesser than us.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.200]   Even when we go evangelize, if they seem intimidating, right, they're older than us, so they're not
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   going to listen.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.120]   My boss, they're not going to listen.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.400]   He's more educated, so he's not going to take me seriously.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.800]   And we go and we start to target people that where we see ourselves, well we know a little
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.880]   better, we're a little bit more knowledgeable, maybe I'm a little bit richer than they are.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.800]   And so we end up targeting people that we think that we can somehow by our earthly influence
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.040]   get them and sell Christ to them and bring them to Christ.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.920]   So we naturally avoid people that we think are richer, are in better position, or are
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.280]   bosses, or live in a better house.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.040]   Because we have somehow convinced ourselves that God has given us the task to convert
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.760]   people.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.840]   We do not have that power.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.640]   That power is in God's hands.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.280]   Our calling is to make the knowledge clear.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.640]   Now when we say that, you say, "Well, Orange County doesn't need that because, you know,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.280]   everywhere we go, there's a mega church down the street.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.160]   I mean, you can drive 10 minutes in every direction and you'll find a mega church."
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   Right?
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.680]   So clearly we're not in a place where that needs to be made known.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.560]   Do you remember years ago, we sent out the whole church out in the street for the purpose
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.800]   of informing our church how many people actually know the gospel in Orange County, in this
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.120]   area?
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.240]   We naturally would think, I mean, there's a mega church here, mega church there, and
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.160]   clearly there must be the gospel.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   Most of the people, even if they don't go to church, must know the gospel.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.240]   Do you remember those of you who participated?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   Most of you were surprised to know how few people actually knew the gospel.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.840]   And we're not even talking about just non-Christians.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.120]   Do you know how often we have people who say that they were raised in the church all their
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   life?
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.640]   Some of them Sunday school for many, many years, Sunday school teachers.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.720]   And we asked them, "If a non-Christian asked you how to have assurance of salvation, what
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.040]   would you say to them?"
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.600]   And they can't explain.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.560]   They're Sunday school teachers.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   And I'm not exaggerating.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.320]   This is very common.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.560]   And so the common answer that we get is, "You have to go to church.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.120]   You have to find a good church.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.280]   You have to read your Bible.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.200]   You have to be moral."
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.960]   And they'll give you all these answers, and we're kind of waiting for them to say, "Well,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.400]   you need to repent of your sins and turn to Christ, and the blood of Christ atone for
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.600]   your sins."
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.520]   And I'm sure they may have heard that somewhere, but they can't articulate it.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.840]   And you know what percentage of people who go to church who can't articulate that?
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.960]   At least that's what we found.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:03.680]   Seventy, eighty percent of people who have proclaimed, have grown up in the church, can't
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.320]   explain what the gospel is.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.500]   Let me ask you.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.740]   You may have friends, family members, co-workers, people, and I'm not even saying go and try
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.000]   to bring them to church or try to have Bible study with them.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.800]   Simply ask them.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.760]   Ask them if they know the gospel.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.620]   A big chunk of them will say they do.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.800]   But don't stop there.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   See if they actually know.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.560]   It's like, "Okay, can you explain what the gospel is?"
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:39.080]   You'll be surprised how many people will tell you, it's like, "Do you have to follow Jesus?
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.640]   You have to be a good person?
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Do unto others as you want them to do unto you?"
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.160]   You'll be surprised what kind of answers that you get.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.640]   Now the reason why I say this is that God didn't call you and me to convert people,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.000]   but you and I have the responsibility to make sure that even if they reject Christ, they're
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.180]   rejecting the Christ of the Bible.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.140]   Many people reject the gospel without even knowing what the gospel is.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:15.800]   And we may be living among them, being around them all their life, and we may have a brother
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.860]   or a sister, father or mother, a co-worker that you spend every day with, and they don't
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.940]   even know what the gospel is.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.780]   At the minimum, you and I have been called to make it clear, as John has been called
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.460]   to make it clear.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.260]   And you'll find when you ask them that they don't want anything to do with church, that
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.260]   it has nothing to do with the gospel.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.980]   I don't want to go to church because they're hypocrites.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.020]   I've known this Christian this many years ago, and I don't want to go for that reason.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.780]   So they're not even rejecting the gospel.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.060]   They're rejecting Christians.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:59.820]   See, John the Baptist was first and foremost called to make the salvation clear, so that
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.860]   whether you receive or you reject, it's the clear knowledge of the gospel that they are
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   receiving.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.680]   But what is this clear knowledge of the gospel?
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.900]   He says it's the forgiveness of sins.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:18.060]   The primary call of the church, and the reason why we desire people to come, is so that their
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.660]   sins may be forgiven.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.580]   It's not so that you can have the best marriage.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.500]   It's not so that you can have godly children.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.180]   I mean, it'd be great if we had all that, but none of that is guaranteed.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.500]   None of that is guaranteed.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.460]   But the main reason why he calls us is for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.260]   You know what?
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.620]   Orange County Christianity, and this is unique, and again, this is not just Orange County,
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.780]   but we're in Orange County, so I'm going to pick on Orange County.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.020]   Because we live in a culture where we just assume like, "Oh, it's evangelized already,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.180]   so we spend all our time focused on our family."
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:02.500]   That the primary call of the Christian is to have godly family, godly marriage.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.340]   And so one of the most popular seminars to give is marriage.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.300]   How to have a godly marriage, and you'll see people coming.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.940]   How to have godly children, and so you'll see people coming.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:22.260]   The call of the church, the call of the church, the primary call of the church, the primary
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.020]   call of the pulpit, is to bring people to Christ.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.820]   To bring them to repentance and to meet Christ.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.020]   There are no separate set of rules and skills that you have.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.100]   This is what it means to be a good Christian, but these are the things you need to do to
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.540]   be a good father.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.100]   They're the same.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.420]   They're the same.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:52.340]   The same calling to be a godly Christian is the same calling, same qualities, same character,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.780]   same activity as a godly individual.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.860]   There are no separate things.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.680]   If you're not walking right with God, you can't be a godly father.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.380]   If you're not sacrificing in serving Christ, there's no separate set of tools that you're
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.900]   going to gain so that you can be a better mother or better father.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.940]   All of it is forgiveness of sins.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:25.220]   When we are reconciled with the God of life, the author of life, the residual effect of
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   our sins being forgiven affects our marriage.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.260]   The residual effect of walking right with God affects our children.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.220]   It affects our society.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.500]   I'm afraid that in Orange County, the focus has so much been put on families and people
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:48.100]   are so eager to learn about being a godly husband, godly father, and not so interested
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.980]   in being a faithful follower of Christ himself.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:58.060]   The primary promise of the gospel is forgiveness of sins.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.460]   Forgiveness of sins.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.460]   And you know what it says?
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.180]   It is the kindness of God.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.060]   It is the demonstration of the mercy of God.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.980]   Because we have a tendency to think that since God is merciful, we deal with people with
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:16.680]   mercy and grace, which means that we're not ever harsh to anybody.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.820]   We're not ever judgmental.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.780]   We never pick a point because God is kind.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:26.060]   Well, the scripture said it is the kindness of God that leads to repentance.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.540]   If somebody is living in sin and they are not brought to repentance, that is not the
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.500]   kindness of God because the only way to find true life is to be reconciled with this holy,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.000]   holy, holy God.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.420]   And as they can live in perfect peace the rest of their life, they can have a healthy
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.420]   life.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   They can have all the money.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.500]   They can have all the money in retirement.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:52.020]   You can have Godly or obedient children.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:34:00.180]   But if you're not reconciled with God, all of that was a smoke screen that leads to condemnation.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.620]   It means nothing.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:10.660]   The primary call of the gospel is repentance and reconciliation and forgiveness of sins.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.020]   That's why if John the Baptist came in and said, "You know what?
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.800]   I'm so concerned about the sinners," and he's constantly encouraging them, "God loves you
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.740]   and has a wonderful plan for your life," and if that's all they hear, that's not from God.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.380]   If somebody who's walking haughty is like, "Oh, I don't want to be judgmental.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:35.320]   I never want to be one of those people," that's not from God either.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.080]   What brings people to repentance is the kindness of God.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.040]   That doesn't mean that God calls us to be jerks.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.080]   It doesn't mean that you need to be yelling at people all the time.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.680]   It doesn't mean you need to be preaching hell all the time.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.800]   But whatever brings people to Christ, that's the mercy of God.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.120]   That's the kindness of God.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.280]   That's the gentleness of God because that's the primary call.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.200]   That's why when John the Baptist first showed up, remember his primary message?
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   What?
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   "God loves you?"
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   No, that wasn't the primary message.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   What was John the Baptist's primary message that he repeated over and over again?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.800]   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   Repent.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.200]   Now you look at that and say, "Whoa, that's kind of harsh.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.440]   People are having a hard time as it is.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.160]   They're oppressed by the Roman government.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.960]   Some people can't even feed their children.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.120]   There are people who are selling their bodies just to make ends meet.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.620]   And here's a prophet of God, the most high God, who's been called to prepare the way
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:39.280]   of the Messiah, and he's going to bring judgment upon them?
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.120]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand?"
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:45.280]   And it turns some people off, especially the Pharisees.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   But it's the kindness of God.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:52.560]   It is the mercy of God to bring them to repentance because the only true life is found when we
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.200]   have peace with God.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.600]   And the only way that we can have peace with God is forgiveness of sins.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.480]   So it is the most loving thing to do.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.800]   It is the most gracious thing to do.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.280]   It is the most gentle and most merciful thing to do, is to bring a sinner to the loving
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.820]   hands of Christ.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:19.480]   That's what John was called to do, and that's what he says of Jesus.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.960]   The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.440]   the sin of the world."
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.840]   And then he describes the coming of Christ as "sunrise from on high will visit us."
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.920]   Sunrise.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:39.240]   Now we know that in the book of John, Jesus himself said, "I am the light of the world."
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.800]   Now the reason why Jesus says that, the context in which Jesus describes himself as the light
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.520]   of the world, was during the Feast of Booths.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.240]   So the Feast of Booths took place right before the Passover.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.640]   And so Feast of Booths basically was Israelites commemorating when they had to leave in haste
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.680]   and they had to live in tents.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.520]   And as God was leading them through the desert, through the pillar of fire, they would set
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.080]   up pillars of fires at the temple, huge pillars of fire.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.880]   And so every, during the Feast of Booths, as they were remembering how they were nomads
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.680]   out in the desert, sleeping in tents, they would look to the fires and say, "One of these
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   days the Messiah is going to come as a light and he's going to lead us into the promised
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.360]   land."
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.200]   It was as they were celebrating the Feast of Booths, Jesus stands there and says, "I
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.320]   am that light."
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.040]   So the Jews understood when he said that.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.680]   So when they say, "John the Baptist is going to declare the sunrise is going to come and
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.480]   visit us," they knew exactly what they meant.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.160]   That Jesus is going to come and he's going to fulfill that promise.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.920]   In Malachi 4, it says, "But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.360]   with healing in its wings and you will go forth and skip about like calves from a stall."
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:00.280]   You will experience this joy of being able to see the light.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.240]   The sunrise is going to come and open your eyes and you're going to be able to see the
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.520]   light.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.840]   In Isaiah 9, it says, "The people who walk in darkness will see a great light.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.680]   Those who live in a dark land, the light will shine on them."
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.160]   And that's exactly how the Bible describes a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.200]   Non-Christian is an individual who has been blinded so that they do not see the light
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.600]   or the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.880]   So a Christian is the one who's opened his eyes.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.760]   Light was turned on.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.440]   And so because the light was turned on, we're able to live.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:41.520]   You know, one of the greatest benefits of going out to India is seeing the byproduct
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.600]   of what some of the things that we're doing.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.480]   You know, when we first started going out, we didn't know exactly what to emphasize.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.800]   So we had, you know, nurses and doctors and we're going to do wound care and all of a
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.560]   sudden we realized that it's very difficult to do way out in the village.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.840]   So there's still wound care going on, VBS and crafts going on.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:05.400]   But the main stuff that we kind of honed in is eye care because you don't have to have,
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.920]   you know, you're not doing any kind of surgery.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.520]   And most people who are 50 and over have cataract because they've been working out in the sun
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.940]   without protection.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.840]   So you can see there's kind of a white haze on them.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.000]   So that's why we give them sunglasses so everybody looks like movie stars by the time we leave,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   right?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   They kind of joke around with each other.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.660]   It's like, "Oh, Bollywood," you know.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:33.880]   Every once in a while we'll meet an individual who's maybe 50 or 60 and they, the only reason
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.560]   why they can't see is because they don't have glasses.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.600]   And you know, some of you who've been with us there, you know, they know exactly what
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.000]   I'm talking about.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.720]   So our eye doctors would do the care and then find out what their dosage is and obviously
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.600]   they have pretty bad eyes and almost surprised that they were able to function.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.200]   Obviously if you don't have any other choice, what can you do?
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.140]   So they're barely functioning, they're barely seeing.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.920]   And then you put their glasses on.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.480]   And literally in minutes they figure out the dosage and they find the right glass and they
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.520]   put it on them and you can see them starting to tear.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.200]   We don't know how long, how bad their eyes were, but as soon as they put the glasses
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.920]   on they saw for the first time in years.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.400]   They functioned the way they did because they had no other option.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.120]   But as soon as that simple eyeglass was put on them, all of a sudden, can you imagine
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.040]   not being able to see and all of a sudden, boom, just like that, you're able to see and
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.400]   man, they're the most appreciative.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.680]   They're like holding your hands with tears, hugging us and just the reward of seeing that,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.140]   just a simple work.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.920]   And that's probably why so many people who've been to India want to keep going back because
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.680]   we're so rewarded by that.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.280]   I've never seen anybody who's experienced that and then take off their glasses and say,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.160]   you know what, I don't like these.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.400]   It makes me look nerdy.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.000]   Like I know it's great that I can see, but my friends are making fun of me.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.520]   And I go to school and I say, "Ooh, Bollywood.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.320]   Could you have something else?"
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.880]   And they may not be the most fashionable.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.400]   It may be from 30 years ago.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.480]   It may look them silly because the glasses that they got were like huge on their face.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.760]   And I remember one particular old man, the glass that they put on him was literally like
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:34.440]   twice the size of his fit, but not one word of complaining.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.160]   He said, "It's just kind of too big.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.840]   Do you have something smaller?"
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.280]   Never.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:47.440]   Because they gain sight for the first time they are able to see.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:55.000]   See, an individual who has his eyes open in the middle of living in darkness can never
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.340]   go back.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.960]   Just like that individual can never take his glasses off and say, you know what, I prefer
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.400]   that because it looks silly on me.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.600]   My friends are making fun of me.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   Or it's not fashionable.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.560]   It doesn't match my dress or it doesn't match my shirt.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   Never.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.240]   But once that person put that glasses on, no matter how silly it may look on his face,
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.920]   he has that on permanently.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.760]   He will keep that on to the day he dies.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.120]   See the Bible says once our eyes became open by the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.220]   you can't close it because you remember what it was like in the darkness.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:34.000]   How can an individual who sees for the first time look at this previous life and say, you
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.240]   know what, that was better because my friends are making fun of me.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.160]   I don't fit well in this world.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.620]   It's very difficult to be a Christian in my work.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.480]   So I'm going to take these off and I'm going to go back.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.240]   You can't.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.720]   It's not because you're trying harder.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.880]   It's not because you shouldn't.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.080]   You can't.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:56.520]   How does somebody who gained sight for the first time return back to their old life?
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.220]   You can't.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.680]   That's why we believe in the perseverance of the saints because the Bible teaches that
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.880]   once your eyes have been opened, you can never shut it again.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   That's why they're rejoicing.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.880]   That's why they're bouncing.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.040]   That's why they're worshiping.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.720]   So God doesn't simply demand worship.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.840]   He creates a position where we can't but worship.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.560]   I don't remember a single person gaining sight like that and then in tears and then we have
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.900]   to tell them, hey, make sure you're thankful.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.960]   Make sure you thank these foreigners who are here.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.900]   I don't ever remember anybody.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   We actually have to kind of push them out of the door because we have other patients
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.360]   that we got to see.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.260]   We have to actually tell them.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.260]   We're filled with joy.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.500]   They're filled with joy.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.900]   This is so worth it.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.140]   How much of our problem is self-created?
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:59.260]   There's a reason why the Bible, the book of Hebrews concludes by saying fix your eyes
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.260]   upon Christ.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.100]   He often perfected our faith.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.080]   Maybe you've forgotten what it is that we have.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   You know what is interesting?
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.340]   In verse 80, this is how it ends.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:16.380]   The child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit and he lived in the deserts
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.620]   until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:28.140]   You would think after hearing this great prophecy that he's going to give the knowledge of salvation,
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:34.420]   the forgiveness of sins, that you would think that right after the prophecy, John the Baptist
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:39.660]   is going to pop out of his mom and then start walking and repent for the kingdom of heaven
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.860]   is at hand.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.380]   But for 30 years, he's just in the desert.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.380]   Thirty years.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.940]   Now, you have to understand who his parents were.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:59.100]   They were people at the end of their life and miraculously God allowed them to experience
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.780]   this birth.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.500]   So humanly speaking, he probably lost his parents pretty early.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.580]   Because they were already at the tail end of life.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:14.860]   If he experienced parenthood, maybe until he was six, ten, most likely he was orphaned
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.460]   pretty early.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:22.620]   So most likely, part of the reason maybe he was out in the desert was because of his financial
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   situation.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.620]   It could have been.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:30.380]   We don't know for sure, but we know that most likely he lost his parents early.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.140]   And then for 30 years, he was in the desert.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:38.100]   I mean, desert is not where you go to be comfortable.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:43.020]   Desert is a place where you struggle to eat, community.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:48.740]   Thirty years later, after this grandiose prophecy about him, he's wandering on the desert and
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:55.820]   then he shows up six months before Christ to prepare the way to come.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.820]   And he experiences the fulfillment of this prophecy probably for no more than six months
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820]   to a year.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.340]   And then as soon as Jesus shows up, that's the man I've been referring to.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.700]   And then as soon as Jesus comes on the scene, he says, "I must decrease and he must increase."
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   And then he just disappears.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.460]   And then eventually, how does he die?
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:19.180]   He doesn't die with veneration and people celebrating him.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.940]   In fact, if you don't read the Bible carefully, you're just like, "What happened to John?"
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.780]   He's just like, "Oh, this happened and the hair didn't like him, got his head chopped
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.780]   off."
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.220]   And it just moves on.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.260]   So if you look at that, it's like, "Wow, he was chosen.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.960]   He's the prophet of the most high God.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   He's going to represent.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.180]   He's going to go ahead and he's going to bring the mountains low and then fill up the valley
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.780]   high in order for the Messiah to come."
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:49.020]   And then experiences hardship, poverty, desert.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:54.580]   And then even when he starts to proclaim, Israel begins to treat him weird and then
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.860]   he gets beheaded and then done.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:02.760]   Who'd want to be John the Baptist?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:11.140]   If the reward for John the Baptist is honor during this life, he didn't get it.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:16.000]   If it was a large crowd for a long period of time, he didn't get it.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.280]   Long life, he didn't get it.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.980]   Good health, he didn't get it.
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.740]   Community, he didn't get it.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.020]   A good family, he didn't get it.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.240]   He had none of that.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.740]   And then he got beheaded.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:36.500]   If the reward was here, it's not worth it.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.220]   It's not worth it.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:45.420]   If because we're faithful that God gives us honor during this life, that honor isn't worth
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.420]   it.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.100]   If you get more money, it's not worth it.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.300]   To live a little bit longer than other people, it's not worth it.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.240]   So that we can have a better retirement, it's not worth it.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.460]   So that we can have more people know our name.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.860]   To do that, for that, it's not worth it.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:11.340]   But that was not the fulfillment of his promise, and neither is it ours.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.360]   Our promise of God's glory isn't here.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.900]   Because you preach the gospel, friends will shun you.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.240]   Because you're faithful to the word, your family will think you're weird.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.220]   Some people will say you're judgmental.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:33.740]   Because you're faithful to the word of God, you may not be able to live the American dream.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.980]   You may not fit where you fit in, even within your own family.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.220]   But glory is coming.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.860]   Not during this lifetime, but when Christ comes.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.820]   You have been crucified with Christ.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:54.860]   It is no longer you who live, but Christ who lives in you.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.300]   The life which you now live, you live by faith in the son of God.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:05.900]   And when he comes, we will experience that glory as he comes in glory.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:13.300]   John the Baptist, though he was a unique prophet of God, the path that he took and the calling
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.340]   that he had is a calling that you and I have.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:25.180]   To live our life aligned with the purpose of God, to prepare this sinful world for the
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:36.220]   coming of Christ, to preach the word, preach the gospel in season and out of season.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.420]   Let's pray.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:50.100]   Gracious, merciful, loving, patient, holy, and faithful God.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.700]   You know how easily we get entangled with this world.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:59.060]   You know how easily we get anxious, Lord God, because we do not have what the world offers.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:03.380]   Help us to live with eternity in mind.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:09.100]   Whether we are up in the mountains or whether we are in the valleys, that we would run to
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.700]   Christ as our refuge.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.440]   That we would know you and to make you known.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.940]   And for that purpose, help us, Lord God, to live.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.980]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.980]   Amen.
