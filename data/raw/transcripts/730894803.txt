[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 2, I'll be reading from verse 1 through 7.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560]   What we're really looking at all the way up to verse 20.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.440]   I'm just going to ask for your understanding because I have candy in my mouth.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.200]   I have a cough drop in my mouth and I've had this lingering cough and I know some people
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.080]   were like, "Is that guy going to spread COVID?"
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.880]   I had this even before, in a lighter version, before I went to India and Korea.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.480]   And then it just got worse.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.880]   So I don't want to be coughing throughout the sermon, so I'm just going to have the
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.080]   candy in my mouth.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.880]   So it's a cough drop.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.200]   I was telling my family that I think it's because of the cats, but they refused to accept
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.980]   it.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.920]   So I'm going to be having a cat because I just don't want to cough.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.840]   If you can turn to Luke chapter 2, 1 through 7, let me read that and we'll jump in.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.560]   "Now in the days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.720]   all the inhabited earth.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.640]   This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200]   And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280]   Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.000]   David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house of family of David, in
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.520]   order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.480]   And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in cloths and laid him in
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.560]   a manger because there was no room for them in the inn."
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.720]   Let's pray.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.020]   Gracious and loving Father, open our eyes, soften our hearts.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.140]   Help us to receive your word as you have intended it.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.000]   Help us not to turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600]   Help us not to take away from it or to add to it.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.380]   May your word that you have ordained come forth and not return until it has accomplished
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380]   its purpose.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.160]   You know, whenever I go to DMV or, you know, where I have to tell them my name and they
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.680]   have to look up my name, usually I go through this cycle of, you know, they ask me what
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.000]   my name is, I say I'm Peter Kim, and then they type it up in their database, and they
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.360]   say, "Well, there's 3,000 Peter Kims in here.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   Which one?"
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   I say, "Peter Ho Kim."
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.600]   And then they'll say, "Well, there's 30 Peter Ho Kims in here, so which Peter Ho Kim are
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   you?"
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.280]   So eventually I have to go and give them my address and give them more information in
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.840]   order for them to identify and to say, "Is this you?"
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   It's yes.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   Well, I had a whole different version of that when I was in India because I was getting
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.560]   COVID tested in order to get into Korea, and they asked me what my name was and say, "Peter
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   Kim," but their database is an international database, not Orange County.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.560]   And then they looked it up and they said, "It looks like there's over 30,000 of you
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   in here, so which Peter Kim are you?"
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.640]   So I had to, you know, nail it down to the United States or Orange County, and then I
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.600]   actually had to give them my address and my passport number and say, "Is this you?"
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.240]   And I had to go through this, you know, to find out exactly who I am.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.160]   So obviously in that context, I need to be able to identify who I am so that they can
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.000]   put it on their database so when I go into different countries, they can say, "Oh, he's
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   vaccinated," or "He did this or that."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.440]   You know, what's interesting is as we try to identify ourselves, maybe your name is
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.520]   not as common as mine.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.320]   You know, I, you know, Kim is a very common name in Korea.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.240]   So typically when you meet another Kim in Korea, they'll ask you, "What kind of Kim
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   are you?"
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   Right?
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.240]   Because it's spelled the same way.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.360]   So our, my Korean, my family's name is Gyeongju Kim.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.560]   Gyeongju Kim is the area that we came from.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   Right?
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.480]   And so that's kind of how we, so it kind of tells you the clan, right?
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.000]   But what's interesting is whenever I talk to a Lee, Park, you know, Choi, or whatever
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.400]   their last name is, and it kind of ties us to our ancestry, most people will add on top
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.800]   of that, it's like, "Oh yeah, our great-great-great-great-grandfather was the last king of Korea."
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.960]   Right?
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.920]   I've never heard a descendant from peasants, ever.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.440]   No matter what country you're from, somewhere in the line, somebody is a king.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.920]   You know, I've never heard somebody say, "Yo, I'm a Kim.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.720]   Yeah, my dad used to take care of cows," you know what I mean?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.880]   Or "My great-great-grandfather was a servant of this great king."
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.000]   So almost everybody has descendants coming from a king somewhere.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.960]   But obviously, we're not all from kings.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.560]   Somebody must be wrong.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.100]   Somewhere down the line, somebody added, you know, or misinformation, and they just kind
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.600]   of came in, because that's what you want to embrace.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.080]   I mean, whether that's true or not, all it does is add a sense of pride, because, you
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.440]   know, at somewhere, maybe our present circumstance is humble, but at some point in our line,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.840]   at somewhere way up in the line, we had somebody very important in our family.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.440]   Whether that's true or not, it's really not that important.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.220]   But the identity of Christ is absolutely crucial to identify that Jesus is the fulfillment
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.520]   of the prophecies that's been given for thousands of years.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   In fact, the Bible has over 25 separate genealogies that are mentioned.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.040]   And most people, when they run to study the Bible, they don't go to the genealogies, right?
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.120]   Even those of you who are studious, genealogies are usually something that you just kind of
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   skim over.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   You recognize a few names, and then you go back.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   But there's a reason why there are so many genealogies in the Bible, because the genealogies
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   are record of God fulfilling His promise all the way from the fall, when He says the seed
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.560]   of the woman is going to come and crush the head of the serpent.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.500]   All the genealogies are a record of God's faithfulness, fulfilling His promise from
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.400]   generation to generation to generation.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   You know what's also interesting is when we read this text, typically this is where we
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.120]   land on Christmas and we hear about Jesus' story.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.360]   But when we read this in our modern day, we look at it and say, "Oh, it's a story about
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.020]   Jesus' birth."
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.920]   But imagine if you are an individual, Christian or non-Christian, and you're reading this
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.480]   for the first time, the person that is highlighted here is Caesar Augustus.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.220]   This is the Caesar of Rome, the greatest, powerful empire of that time.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so naturally you would gravitate towards Caesar Augustus.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.340]   In fact, Caesar Augustus is not a name, it's a title.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.880]   Caesar is basically the emperor of Rome and Augustus until this man was never even used
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.200]   of a human being.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.000]   Augustus basically means honored or exalted one.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.920]   So because he was so popular for the first time, they actually attributed that to a human
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   being.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.060]   And so if you were reading this in the first century, it's like, "Caesar Augustus?
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.000]   What is he doing?"
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.800]   But now we look at it and Caesar Augustus is actually just a side comment.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.720]   In fact, the rest of this morning I'm not even going to mention him because it just
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   happens that God used him to fulfill what he was doing.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:23.040]   But the highlight of this whole story is about this child who comes from no significant background,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.080]   born of a young teenage girl in a manger with shepherds as a witness.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.600]   Would have been insignificant compared to this man, but now 2,000 years later, knowing
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.280]   who he is, he's the central figure of this story.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.520]   There's a reason for that because all of this is a fulfillment and is a record of God's
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.960]   faithful promise.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.680]   That Jesus is the fulfillment of the promise.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.080]   In Micah chapter 5, it says, "But as for you, Bethlehem Ephraith, too little to be
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.840]   among the clans of Judah.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   From you one will go forth from me to be ruler in Israel.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.600]   His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity."
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.680]   In other words, this fulfillment of this prophecy is not a random set of events.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.420]   The genealogical records are not random set of events.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.960]   This is something that God has ordained.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   In fact, if you remember in the previous, it talked about this fulfillment of the son
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.200]   of God that's coming.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.240]   Son of the most high God.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.220]   He's not just a fulfillment of the King Leland, which clearly he is because Bethlehem basically
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.080]   means city of David, and he's going back to have a concrete record that this is who he
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   is.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.020]   He's coming from the tribe of Judah.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:46.620]   But more than that, if you remember the prophecy, he says he's not just a human king.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.140]   He's the son of the most high God, and he's going to be the eternal ruler and establish
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.180]   a kingdom that's going to be everlasting.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:00.300]   So if you understood and you heard that prophecy, what do you think would have been the next
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.120]   event?
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.500]   Some parade maybe?
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.900]   Maybe the kings of Rome or at least in Israel, they would have prepared and you would have
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.340]   thought that there were going to be a gigantic crowd to receive them.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:24.620]   Instead, there's this chaotic scene of a non-month pregnant child who's moving around, not knowing
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.020]   where she's going to give birth.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.660]   The storyline is pretty clear what Luke is trying to convey.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.540]   Luke is not just gathering random facts and just putting it together and Theophilus hears
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.820]   a record.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.020]   There's a point that Luke is trying to make, and it's pretty clear that God's perfect plan
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.700]   is unfolding through humble means.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.040]   God's perfect plan is unfolding through humble means.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.460]   You would expect something spectacular is happening, but this is consistent with what
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.780]   we saw in chapter one.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.300]   Remember, he said the son of God is coming, and then prophecy comes to Zacharias and Elizabeth
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.360]   that they're going to have a child.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.900]   This is an old couple, beyond years of being able to bear children, and God blesses them
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.300]   and they're able to have a child.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.360]   Now we talked about that last few Sundays, that in this particular time to not be able
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.620]   to have children was considered possibly a curse from God, even though it had nothing
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.620]   to do with God.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.420]   God prepared them for this blessing, but the nation of Israel kind of whispered from the
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.060]   background that they must have done something wrong, kind of like Job's friends.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.980]   When he was suffering, they were kind of telling him, "You must have done something wrong."
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.380]   It was to this humbled old couple that this prophecy comes.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.700]   In fact, in Mary's song, her whole song is, "The reason God chose me," she says, "is because
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.380]   I was humble."
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.140]   And then the rest of the prophecy basically, or the Psalms, goes, "God, how he humbled
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:59.300]   the proud, the kingdoms, and he raises up those who are humble."
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.220]   In fact, John the Baptist, where we left off, right?
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.220]   Jesus calls him the greatest of all those who were born of a woman until the time of
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.500]   Christ and to the new covenant.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.100]   But what made John so great?
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.380]   After the prophecy, how he's going to go ahead and prepare the way for the Messiah and the
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.020]   king, he basically goes out into the desert, most of his life, probably loses his aged
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.140]   parents and lived and grew as an orphan out in the desert.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.780]   We don't hear about him until about six months before Jesus shows up.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.740]   And then he goes out preaching and prepare the way of Christ, repent for the kingdom
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.060]   of heaven is at hand.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.020]   And then after Jesus shows up, he lives maybe another six months and then he's beheaded
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.780]   and he dies.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.980]   So when we talk about John the Baptist being the greatest of all the other prophets, what
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.260]   made him greater than Moses?
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.400]   What made him greater than Elijah?
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.140]   What made him great?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.220]   All we know is that short period where he stood before the coming of Christ to point
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.220]   to him.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:05.820]   And so all we know is his greatness was related to his proximity to Christ and his humility.
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.780]   That when Christ came, all he did was say, I must decrease and he must increase.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.820]   And in the same line, as Jesus, the King of kings and Lord of Lord is coming, the story
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.660]   of the birth of Christ begins with this edict.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.820]   And can you imagine of that time when it says it's the way it's spelled out, he says all
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:33.780]   of the known earth, obviously under Rome's rule was given an edict to go back to their
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.980]   hometown, their ancestor hometown, not that where they grew up, not where they were born,
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.060]   but their ancestors.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:47.700]   Clearly God's hand is in that because there's a clear record of Jesus's heritage that's
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.260]   coming from the line of Judah.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.460]   But can you imagine the historical scene of what's going on?
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.940]   Everybody packing their bags.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.660]   If I, you know, if there was an edict in our generation and said, you have to go back to
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.380]   your ancestor home and to be counted and you have the next three months to do so.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.140]   Can you imagine the chaos that's going to break out?
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.980]   Almost every single person in this room, I would say probably every single person in
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.420]   this room, and no matter what stage in life you are, right, maybe you're in the middle
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.940]   of business, right, or maybe you're waiting for something.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.020]   Maybe your wife is pregnant.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.140]   Doesn't matter what circumstance you are in.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.260]   Everybody has to pack their bags, find tickets, and you got to go back to whatever country,
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.620]   whatever place you're in, because I don't think anybody was here in Irvine, right, a
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.180]   thousand years ago, right?
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.180]   So can you imagine what that was like?
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.940]   Everybody just packing their bags and leaving.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:48.580]   I remember the closest thing to this I experienced when I was in Beijing in 1993 on our first
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.460]   trip while I was a seminary student.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.160]   It was right at the beginning of the Spring Festival.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.760]   And so those of you guys who know about the Spring Festival, that's like they give you
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.840]   about one month to go back home.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.560]   And this is a period in 1993 where it wasn't the country it is now, where it's very developed
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.980]   and everybody's riding cars, but I would say 90, 95% of Beijing was still riding bicycles.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.380]   And so the only transportation that they had to be able to get somewhere far is to get
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.380]   on this train.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.360]   Now, so you have to remember at that time where people lived was basically where the
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360]   government told you to.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.740]   So if you were a good student and you graduated and they made you an engineer, they'll say
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.620]   there's a company that, you know, run by the state and we need you to live over there.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.100]   So they would sometimes move you hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles away from you.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.400]   And so only during the Spring Festival, if you saved up enough money, you can buy a ticket
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.260]   and then get on the train and get back home.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   But if you're not able to go back home, basically you have a whole another year you have to
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.660]   wait until you can buy the ticket and go home.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.700]   So can you imagine the number of people who are headed toward the train station at the
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.840]   beginning of the Spring Festival?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.900]   We just happened to be traveling right at that time.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:03.520]   And so when we went to the train station, there were pictures, large cardboard pictures
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.420]   of just mangled people everywhere.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.980]   It was just gruesome.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.060]   I said, why are they doing this?
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.380]   So I asked the guy who was guiding us.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.180]   It's like, why are they hanging these gruesome pictures at the train station?
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.320]   And they said that every year we have so many hundreds and thousands of people who get mangled
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.440]   on the train because they are trying so hard to get on the train.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.940]   And so if they can't get on and get regular seats, regular seats mean just even just standing,
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.460]   sometimes they would have to go for three, four days.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.020]   But so many people just hanging on from the outside because that's the only way that they
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.380]   can get home.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.420]   And as a result of that, many hundreds, hundreds, sometimes thousands of them will be thrown
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.700]   under the train and get mangled.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.740]   So they would put these pictures to scare people that if you try to get on this train,
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.740]   this is going to happen.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:54.060]   Now I know that during this period when the people were moving around, maybe the population
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.540]   wasn't as big, but can you imagine the chaos?
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:04.300]   You would expect that after a prophecy of the king, son of the most high God who's
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:10.380]   going to conquer all their enemies and bring about final peace, that you would think that
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.820]   there will be something else going on right after.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.660]   But the very next scene, we see utter chaos.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.340]   Mary was nine months pregnant.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:24.060]   Those of you who have children or experienced pregnancy, if she's nine months pregnant,
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.060]   she's about to give birth.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.340]   Do you make travel plans?
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.420]   No.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.540]   You can't even come to the retreat if it's too close to the date, because if it happens,
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.720]   you have to be closer to the hospital.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.300]   But can you imagine being nine months pregnant and she's about to give birth and now they
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:45.820]   got to pack up and travel 80 miles from where they are to move to Bethlehem, just because
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.900]   of the census.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.960]   Now 80 miles at that time, just normal healthy adults would take them about five or six days.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.220]   But with her being fully pregnant, and typically when we see Mary traveling, we see her on
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.200]   a donkey and Joseph kind of carrying her along.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.580]   That may have been the case, but we know that they weren't rich.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.580]   They didn't have money.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.440]   So the possibility that they may have walked this whole process is probably highly likely.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:19.580]   That this 13, 14 year old teenage girl with the husband who is, with Joseph, who's only
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.780]   a couple of years older, is in the middle of this chaos.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:30.500]   And imagine, remember, she's holding the King of Israel in her stomach.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.860]   So can you imagine what she was thinking?
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.020]   You prophesied that I'm going to give birth to the King of Kings and this is how he's
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.460]   going to come?
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.540]   Out on the street?
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.820]   In fact, you know what's interesting is most likely they made this journey alone.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:53.140]   And the reason why I believe that is because in Luke chapter 2, 5, it says, "In order to
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.140]   register along with Mary, who was engaged to him and was with child, engaged."
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.100]   Remember nine months ago when the prophecy came, how Joseph responded to that?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.740]   That she's not even married with her yet, but during the time of engagement, prophecy
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.580]   comes and says, "Your wife is pregnant."
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.260]   And so Joseph's response in Matthew 1, 19, it says, "Joseph, her husband, being a righteous
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.820]   man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly."
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.740]   So Joseph was very concerned.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.580]   Being a righteous man, he could have just blasted it and said, "How could she have done
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.580]   this?"
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.340]   And then to save face, dismiss her.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.660]   To shame her and her family and him go his own way and marry another person.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:40.180]   But instead the angel comes and reminds him, he's like, "This is not because she was unfaithful."
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.640]   In fact, exactly the opposite.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.100]   God has favored her and this child is a son of God.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.000]   But he did this, he says, discreetly.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.460]   And most likely, my guess is, the people around them did not believe that.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.400]   All they know is that this young girl that was betrothed to Joseph was pregnant.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.920]   And maybe they tried to tell them, but I don't know how many of them would actually believe
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.160]   it.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.000]   Because even Zacharias and Elizabeth had a hard time believing.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.080]   But my guess is they kind of kept it discreet.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.120]   And it says on this journey, they were still engaged nine months later.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.880]   So they waited until she gave birth.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.660]   Maybe start over somewhere new.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:27.200]   So this whole journey, being discreet, maybe running away from shame, pointing fingers
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.920]   for where they were at, and they're moving along.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.280]   And then finally, when they get to Bethlehem, all these people were traveling back.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.160]   All these people, maybe ancestors come from Bethlehem.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.920]   They probably got there first.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.240]   Because she was pregnant, so it probably took her longer.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.200]   If a normal adult would take five days, my guess is it would have taken her many more
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   days than that.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   So by the time they arrive, the inn is completely full.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.200]   And as a result, she ends up giving birth.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   And Jesus is in the manger.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.400]   The manger basically is where the animals eat their food and drink their water.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.120]   You know, what's interesting was years ago, now we have funds and we're doing all this
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.760]   stuff and we have a nice portable baptismal.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.240]   But years ago, when our church didn't have money, we're Baptist, so we need to have a
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.620]   baptismal.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.360]   But we couldn't afford a nice one, right?
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.680]   So we were researching online, and I was researching, and I found that a lot of the churches who
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.520]   don't have money would buy this tin tank.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.840]   It's about 200 gallons, and it's big enough for an average adult can get and dunk.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.120]   So they would take this outside, fill it with water, and then that's where they would do
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   baptism.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.200]   So a few churches, not many, found that they were using that because they didn't have money.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.480]   So we were very tempted to get that because we didn't have money.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.160]   And it was only a couple hundred bucks.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.240]   And at the end, I decided not to do that because, you know, we're getting baptized and people
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.600]   are starting their new life in Christ, and we have guests coming giving their testimony
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:07.200]   and they're going to go into this tin tank where the horses drink their water, you know
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   what I mean?
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.800]   And people are going to come and say, "What is this?"
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   So for that purpose, it's kind of humiliating to present this in this tank, and so we decided
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.320]   not to do that.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.120]   Well, this is the Son of God.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.520]   The Son of God that was prophesied, who's going to bring eternal peace.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.760]   Like they come and He's in a manger.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.900]   This is not by accident.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.280]   It wasn't because they didn't have money.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.600]   This is not by accident.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.120]   God is clearly trying to do something here.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   In fact, the first group of people that are given to be a testimony of this, it says they
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   were shepherds.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.960]   Now you have to understand the shepherds at that time was a dirty profession.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.520]   It was probably the lowliest of profession.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.960]   Not only because they were around animals all the time, and they were dirty and they
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:06.000]   smelled like animals, the Jews considered them unclean because they were around unclean
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.380]   animals all the time, so they said, "Oh, they must also be unclean."
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.040]   And so not only were they physically the lowliest, even spiritually, these are people that they
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.880]   wouldn't want to have in their house.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.760]   And Luke emphasizes it was the shepherds that were noted, and then they were the ones to
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.200]   come and they were the ones to praise God and they were the first witnesses to tell
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.440]   other people.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   It's not by accident.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.400]   In fact, in the book of Matthew, it says that the Magi's were alerted.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.880]   They saw the prophecy of the star, which represents the King of Israel is going to come.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.000]   And when they found out about this, where did they go?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.840]   Straight to the King, King Herod, and gathered the high priest because they wanted to find
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.760]   out where this was going to happen.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.480]   Why did they go to King Herod?
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.200]   Where else would the King be?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.760]   When the Magi's, these Gentiles, heard about this and this prophecy was going to be fulfilled,
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.720]   not knowing what's going to happen, of course they went to the King of Israel and asked,
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.820]   this prophecy is being fulfilled, where is this King?
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.800]   And obviously King Herod, understanding this, in fear of losing his throne, sends an edict
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.580]   to kill all the babies, male children.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.320]   And so the Magi's are alerted, don't go back, you may not survive this.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.360]   And then they follow the star that takes them to where Jesus is.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:34.680]   Can you imagine the shock of the Magi's when they went to the King and are rejected and
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:42.080]   then they actually follow the star to where the real King is and he's in a manger.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.360]   It doesn't record their reaction, but you can imagine what their reaction is.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.600]   This is the King?
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.880]   King of Israel?
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.480]   In a manger?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.760]   With these children?
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.960]   How can this be the King?
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.120]   Again, it's not recorded their reaction, but all of this is not by accident.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.600]   Luke is not just bringing together just random set of facts, random set of things that took
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.000]   place and said, it just happens to be that this is the context in which Jesus came.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Luke is emphasizing every single part of this for a reason.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.560]   We talked about this last time, that God who is exalted, emptied himself, became nothing
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   in order to walk among us so that he can be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:38.840]   Every part of the call of Christian life is to empty ourselves, not to become something,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.600]   not to gain notoriety, not to become this great name, but to empty ourselves so that
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   we can be useful.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.800]   Remember in Matthew chapter 8 verse 20, the scribes come to Jesus because he's beginning
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.400]   to get fame and people are starting to follow him.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.240]   And the scribes who are very educated, who knew the law more than anybody else, came
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480]   to Jesus and said, we want to follow you.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.800]   But Jesus knowing exactly where their heart is, says to them, Jesus said to him, the foxes
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.840]   have holes, birds of the air have nests, but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:21.300]   In other words, you're coming to me to seek glory, but the son of man is homeless.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.680]   You're coming because you think that if you hang out with the Messiah, that somehow some
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.120]   of that glory is going to come to you, just like the disciples.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.440]   As he's prophesying, he's going to go to the cross.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.680]   Can we sit to the left or to the right?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.920]   And he says, I'm going to the cross.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   I'm going to die.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.720]   And he's told his disciples, if you want to follow me, you deny yourself, empty yourself,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.520]   humble yourself, and pick up your cross and follow me as well.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.720]   Think about the beatitudes when Jesus begins to speak about the kingdom of God.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.540]   And he begins by explaining that the kingdom of God is completely different than the kingdom
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.680]   that you're used to in this world.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.800]   What do we consider to be blessed?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.240]   Blessed are the poor.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.600]   I mean, how often do we say we're blessed because God gave us a good job?
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.840]   How blessed are we because we got a raise?
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.600]   We're able to find and be able to pay our bill.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   We're so blessed.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.260]   But Jesus says, blessed are the poor.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:23.440]   If you were sad and God answers your prayers and we're rejoicing, he says, no, blessed
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.860]   are those who mourn, blessed are those who are gentle, blessed are those who hunger and
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.600]   thirst for righteousness.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.560]   You know how often we think of like establishing righteousness because we do quiet time, we're
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.240]   so disciplined and we read scripture and we're evangelizing.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:48.200]   And sometimes when we are good at spiritual things, so we're blessed.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.960]   He says, blessed are those who hunger and thirst.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.920]   Sometimes those who are the most broken are hungering and thirsting.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.760]   Those who recognize their own sins, those who have gone through trouble and fell into
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.480]   sin and in need of repentance sometimes.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.980]   He says those who are hungering and thirsty sometimes, and I confess, you know, being
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:19.420]   a leader is hard because when you're a leader, you have to teach and everywhere we go, every
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.400]   person I meet, I have to teach.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.720]   So one of the downfalls of being a leader is you stop becoming a student for a while.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.180]   You become a teacher.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.800]   And I see a lot of people fall into this temptation that as soon as you become a leader, you have
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.920]   this mindset of like, I got to have all the answers.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.640]   He says, no, you're not blessed because you know, or you have a degree or, you know, you've
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.000]   been around for a long time and you have all these experiences.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.160]   He says, blessed are you because you hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.840]   Think about who hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.960]   Usually it's new Christians, brand new Christians.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.640]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.080]   Blessed are those who are merciful, not those who conquer and are able to defeat every argument,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.720]   but he said those who are merciful, those who are pure in heart, those who are peacemakers.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.720]   You know, we think about our current situation.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:18.120]   We said India, the persecution meter is rising rapidly in North Korea.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.840]   You can't even own a Bible that could cause you to have death sentence.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.900]   There's certain part of Middle East just for gathering like this.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.640]   There's a possibility that you may be blown up.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.800]   Here it says, blessed are those who are persecuted.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.080]   We think of blessing as because we live in a free country, nice air conditioned room
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.800]   and park your cars and we have these buildings.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.980]   We're so blessed.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.480]   But Jesus says, blessed are those who are persecuted.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.080]   Blessed are you when you are insulted.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.920]   Now why are they all blessed?
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.960]   If you know the Beatitudes, every one of these things he said they're blessed because it's
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.200]   a doorway to Christ.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.540]   Every single one of them.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.540]   Every single one.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:07.160]   Whatever brings you closer, whatever causes you to be broken and bring you closer to Christ
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.600]   is the blessing from God's perspective.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.200]   Matthew chapter 18, one through four, it says at that time the disciples came to Jesus
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.920]   and said, "Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.480]   And he called the child to himself and said him before them and said, "Truly I say to
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.800]   you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.440]   heaven.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.560]   Whoever then humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.960]   You know, I've heard some people say that what Jesus was saying here is don't ask questions,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   right?
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.100]   Like a child.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.580]   So if Jesus says jump, you just jump like a child.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.980]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.860]   He's saying this because they're coming and asking this question, who's the greatest?
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.720]   So he's pointing to a child who has no power, no authority, no honor.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   He has nothing.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   He can't own property.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.240]   And he's talking to the lowliest, humblest person that he can think of and he says, "Unless
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.480]   you become like him, you cannot understand the kingdom of heaven."
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.320]   How much of our life is a pursuit of the next stage?
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:21.000]   When we plant the church, when we get educated, get a job, our relationship, how much of our
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.500]   pursuit is somehow getting to the next stage of glory?
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:32.440]   Even in the church, in the name of Christ, how much of it is so that we can get to the
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.500]   next stage of glory?
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.620]   And James chapter 1, 14 to 15, he says, "But each one is tempted when he is carried away,
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.820]   enticed by his own lust.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.100]   Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.820]   And when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death."
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.780]   You know, when we think of lust, we automatically think sexual lust, which is part of that.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.740]   But the word lust simply means great passion.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.640]   Great passion.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.220]   Sexual lust is not the only lust.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.260]   What about the passion?
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.740]   What about this desire to make it in life?
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.820]   What if this desire, you go to someone's house, it's like, "Wow, I want to live in that house."
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.580]   How much of our anger and how much of our fighting is because our desires, our strong
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.380]   desires, somebody gets in the way?
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:27.780]   Our pride is the source of the conflict among our friendship, in our marriages, our relationships,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.580]   and even with our children.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:36.700]   Pride is the reason, oftentimes, why churches break up, why we fight with our neighbors,
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:42.260]   why even wars begin.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:51.580]   Pride is the source and the underlying factor that identifies a rebellious man.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:57.820]   Wanting to touch some of that glory, wanting to have what God has, maybe in different degrees.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.740]   The whole world is in pursuit, and you know it.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.780]   I know it.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:08.220]   Because the moment that we are born, the question is, what is he going to be?
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.660]   And we have in Korea, we have this doljabi thing.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.860]   Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.060]   You've been to one of those parties and you grab what he's going to be, and it's usually
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.660]   his doctor, it's a scholar, he's going to be a businessman.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.260]   I've never seen anybody put trashcan in there.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.300]   And he throws up and he grabs the trash.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:36.020]   Because, like all of us, we are expecting that our children are going to become something
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.580]   great.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:43.980]   And so all our pursuit is pursuing what we may have had in our mind, now we're hoping
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.900]   that our children will fulfill that.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:51.660]   But how much of our natural pursuit of our glory and glory for our children is killing
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.700]   us?
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:02.260]   This is not by accident that the Son of God came in the lowliest of possible situation.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.580]   These are not just random facts.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.420]   God is demonstrating to us.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.700]   And he says, if you want to live, what does he say?
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.700]   Die.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:17.540]   He who finds his life in me will find it.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.740]   See, because the Jews and the people of that time could not understand this, and say, why
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.340]   would the King of Kings, who's going to establish us and bring eternal peace and conquer all
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.220]   our enemies, why would he go to the cross?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.220]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.940]   Even the disciples didn't understand, even as he was making it very plain.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.180]   Maybe we just didn't understand.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:44.180]   I know he said he was going to die and be crucified, but maybe we just don't understand.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.320]   How much of our frustration in our walk with God is because we don't understand?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.160]   How much of our frustration if God's not answering our prayers is because we don't understand?
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.960]   That where God wants to lead us is the exact opposite of our pursuit.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:05.680]   That we've created in our mind that being blessed means this, this, this, and this,
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.760]   even in the church, even with our children.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.240]   But here's a thing that I think is important for us not to miss.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:21.440]   Because when we think of Christ, it's like he's humble, right?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.300]   In fact, we would say that he's not just humble, he's humiliated.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.760]   If you follow me, not only do you have to humble yourself, you must be willing to be
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.680]   humiliated.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.960]   But understand, he's not just calling us to be humble, to empty ourselves, become nothing.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.120]   There's a reason for that.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.200]   Jesus did what he did in order to seek and save the lost.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.080]   In fact, if you see his exalted state, right, in the book of Revelation or whenever you
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.440]   see prophecy of Christ in his throne, he's not in a humbled state.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.480]   He's not on his knees.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.420]   He's glorified.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.800]   He's sitting at the right hand of God.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.280]   And all of Israel, all of mankind are bowed down worshiping him.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.820]   In fact, Philippians chapter 2 ends with that.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.360]   Because he humbled himself, God exalted him to be a name above every name, every knee
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.760]   shall bow, every tongue confess that Christ is Lord.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:18.800]   So that's, his humbled state was during the period when he was here specifically for the
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.480]   purpose of saving the lost.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.840]   In Mark chapter 10, 45, it says, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.200]   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:39.600]   He hummed himself and became nothing to save us, to walk in our shoes, to go where we were
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.200]   at so that he can be a sympathetic high priest.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:51.720]   He experienced the manger, the shepherds, the chaos, being born in this young family,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:58.480]   maybe losing his father at early age, suffering the things that sinful mankind experiences,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.280]   all for the purpose of saving us.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:08.280]   Luke 19, 10, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost."
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.160]   And Jesus told his disciples that you must do the same.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.520]   Apostle Paul says the same thing in 1 Corinthians 9, 19-23.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   He says, "For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all."
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.440]   At that time, in any period of time, who aspires to be a slave?
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.520]   Apostle Paul was a Roman citizen.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.920]   He was more privileged than an average Jew.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:42.600]   He was a Pharisee among Pharisees, possibly already sat in the Sanhedrin.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.720]   The guy who discipled him was Gamaliel, already famous, the top scholar of Israel.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.080]   And he says he's a free man who can travel anywhere he wants.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.720]   He has all the money and family prestige.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:37:01.280]   And he says, "Though I am free, I have made myself a slave to all so that I may win more."
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.840]   He emptied himself and stepped in his shoe and took on what a slave would have to do
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.080]   in order to save them.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.340]   "To the Jews I became as a Jew so that I might win the Jews.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.360]   To those who are under the law as under the law, though not being myself under the law
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.400]   so that I might win those who are under the law."
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.280]   Imagine Apostle Paul lived all his life trying to live perfectly under the law.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.720]   And imagine the kind of life a Pharisee had to live in order to be considered a perfect
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.440]   Jew.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.560]   And Apostle Paul was on the top of that and then meeting Christ and realizing all of them
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.960]   had been freed.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.680]   The sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law, but we have been separated.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.820]   We have been delivered and covered.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.400]   So we're no longer under the law.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.680]   So can you imagine the freedom that they felt living under this oppression of the law and
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.740]   being freed?
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:38:00.680]   And yet Paul says he puts himself right back to live under the law to save those who are
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   under the law.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:08.100]   Turn 21, "To those who are without the law as without the law, though not being without
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.680]   the law of God but under the law of Christ so that I might win those who are without
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.940]   the law."
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.160]   He was called as an apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.560]   And you remember how much Paul hated the Gentiles.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.400]   They were unclean people.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:28.080]   That good Jew wouldn't even step into Samaritan because they considered themselves to be unclean.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.240]   And so if you look at the New Testament, so much of the language is trying to bring the
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.100]   Gentiles and the Jews to be able to worship together.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.160]   And yet Apostle Paul says, "To those without the law I became without the law.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.320]   To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.200]   I have become all things to all men so that I might be all means, save some.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.760]   I do all things for the sake of the gospel so that I may become a fellow partaker of
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.240]   it."
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:01.160]   You cannot love, truly love, without emptying yourself.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:05.200]   It's not possible.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.540]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:13.920]   If there was a job description that said, "Your job is to wipe people's butts," right,
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   would you sign up?
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.160]   Some of you have already signed up because you're nurses.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.480]   Whether you like it or not, it comes with the job.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.520]   But if somebody said, "You can be a nurse without wiping butts," I'm sure most of you
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.520]   would sign up.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520]   You do it.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.240]   I think it's a very honorable profession, but it's a dirty job.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.000]   And you do it, right?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.740]   And more power to you.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:41.360]   But if you had an option not to wipe butts, right, and give needles and take care of them,
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.640]   do all this stuff, I'm sure you would easily volunteer.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:49.300]   It's like, yeah, that one thing will hire somebody else, right?
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.580]   What if the job description says, "You got to wipe butts," with no pay?
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:01.600]   Who would sign up?
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:10.780]   In fact, not only will people sign up, many of you have already signed up.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:17.900]   Every parent has wiped butts for years.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.040]   There are people in our church who are praying to wipe butts, that they get an opportunity
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.680]   to wipe some butts.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.040]   And you're doing it happily, voluntarily, and it brings joy to your life.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   Why do you do that?
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.580]   Because you love that child.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:39.480]   Every single one of you had your butts wiped, and every single parent has wiped butts.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   Why do you do that?
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.640]   Because you love them.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.900]   I know some people, they gag at their own poo.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.780]   And it was like, "Well, how are they going to have kids?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.140]   I'm not going to change diapers."
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:58.060]   But they adjust because it's their own kid, because they love them.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:06.460]   The Bible says, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son."
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:12.820]   Every step of redemptive history, every step of Jesus' journey to do what he did, was not
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.060]   just humbling, it was humiliating.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:23.700]   And the only reason that you and I can possibly fathom is his love.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.860]   Now, that's the mystery.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.680]   Hell is not a mystery.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.380]   Every single one of us would create hell for the Nazis.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.440]   Every single one of us would create hell.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.500]   We just don't know who to put in there.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.340]   That's not the mystery.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:48.620]   The mystery is why would the Son of the Most High God put himself to be humiliated to save
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.440]   us.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.300]   You know, those of you who have children, you know, you're raising your kids, and because
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:03.100]   of your love, you're going to be challenged one day, to different degrees.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:10.820]   You know, those teenage years come around, and you hold on to your pride, you're not
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.380]   going to make it.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.860]   God's going to humble you.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.980]   He's going to humble you.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.500]   Everything that you held, "How dare he?
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.140]   How can he say, after all I've done, after everything I've done, after the sacrifice
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.780]   I've made, how can he possibly say this?"
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:30.980]   And everything in your flesh wants to, "Get the heck out of my house."
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:37.260]   But the love of Christ, love for your child, will compel you to humble yourself for their
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.260]   sake.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:44.300]   And that's exactly what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5.14, "For the love of Christ controls us,"
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:49.060]   in the NIV it says, "It compels us, having concluded that one died for all, therefore
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.060]   all died."
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.820]   You know what context Paul is saying this?
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.660]   This is a church that Paul loved dearly.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:03.620]   He came and he sacrificed, and he came to the city, burnt out, and being beaten, stoned,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.100]   put into prison, and then Jesus himself said, "I have many disciples here, you continue
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.100]   to preach."
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.420]   And he labors there for a year and a half.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.260]   He loves this church, but the church started going off, getting divided, all chaos coming
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.260]   in.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:21.940]   So Paul had to write this very difficult letter in 1 Corinthians, and their response in many
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.220]   of them was not good.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:29.020]   "Who the heck is this guy telling us, 'Shall I come to you with a whip?'"
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.220]   He said, "Maybe this guy's not an apostle."
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.700]   They were questioning his apostles, so he writes a second letter defending his apostleship.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:43.260]   And he's struggling to love them and to rebuke them at the same time.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.180]   Humanly speaking, just shake off the dust, just move on, there's so many other places.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.180]   Just move on.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:56.380]   In fact, the thorn on his side, in my opinion, most likely was his detractors.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.380]   Who is this guy?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.300]   But Jesus says, "In order to humble him because so much was coming through him, in
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:07.220]   order to keep him humble, God allowed the thorn on his side to continue."
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.260]   Because once pride started coming, it will ruin him.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.420]   And so Paul is writing this in this context of probably wanting to wrap it up, move on,
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.380]   shake off the dust, and why is he writing this letter?
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:29.340]   He says, "For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.660]   all, therefore all died."
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.780]   Because Christ did that for me.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.540]   Because Christ did that for you.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.100]   That's why we persevere.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.660]   That's why we humble ourselves.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.860]   And that's why we continue.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.820]   Sanctification is not becoming more.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.140]   Sanctification is becoming less, becoming less.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:59.540]   So that as we become closer and closer to Christ, that we can have the same attitude
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.300]   that John the Baptist had.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:07.140]   That I must decrease, so he must increase.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.900]   None of this is by accident.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:13.460]   Every part of his birth story is to remind us.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.580]   Humble Christ in his humility.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.380]   Glory will come one day when he comes.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:25.220]   But until then, for the sake of the lost, clothe yourself with Christ.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.740]   That we may go where he goes.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.660]   Uncomfortable places.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.660]   People we would not naturally love.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.780]   Say things that we would not naturally say, that have consequences.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.820]   But we would get out of ourselves, humble ourselves, as Christ came to us, that we would
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   go to them.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   Let's pray.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:55.140]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:59.100]   You know our struggle with our flesh.
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:08.740]   How much we struggle to compete, to compare, and ultimately creating conflicts.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:15.460]   Lord teach us what it means to deny ourselves, and pick up our own cross and follow you as
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.380]   well.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:27.180]   Lord, we thank you for your love, your humility, your humiliation.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.820]   That we also may have life abundantly in you.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.460]   May your name be exalted.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.020]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.460]   Amen.
