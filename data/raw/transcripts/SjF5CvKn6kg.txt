[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.780]   And just like as we sing, Lord,
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   we just want to pray that you would fill us
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.780]   with your heart, Lord,
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   and lead us through your spirit and your love
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.780]   to those around us, Lord.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   And we want to be led by the spirit,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.780]   we want to walk by the spirit,
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   but God, often we just, it's impossible with our flesh.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.780]   So we ask for your spirit to guide us,
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   and Lord, every word, every thought,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.780]   every intention of our heart, Lord,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.780]   it is our prayer that it would be pleasing to you,
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.780]   that it would be a blessing to you
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.780]   and those around us, Lord.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.780]   So as we just continue our worship into our Bible study,
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.780]   would you just be with us?
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   And all the glory to you, God.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.780]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.780]   Let's all meet back at eight.

[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   All right, for those of you guys who are in the rooms,
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780]   now that it's about eight o'clock,
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.780]   let's go ahead and come on out,
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.780]   and we'll do a review in the next minute.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   (congregation chattering)
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   (congregation chattering)

[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:09.780]   (congregation chattering)
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.780]   A little bit closer to the mouth, okay.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   (congregation chattering)
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.780]   Testing, testing, one, two, three.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.780]   Testing, testing, one, two, three.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   Can you guys hear it okay?
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780]   (congregation chattering)
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   Yes?
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   Not so much?
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.780]   Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.780]   Testing, testing, one, two, three.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   This passage has a lot of stuff, huh?
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:37.780]   My guess is your discussions went pretty fast.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.780]   We kind of ran out of time at our table.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.780]   Wait till you guys get to next week's passage,
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.780]   and it's gonna be even longer.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.780]   All right, good.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.780]   All right, you guys, let's take a moment to pray
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.780]   and then jump right into the review.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   Heavenly Father, we do thank you.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   God, we thank you so much for the blessings
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.780]   and the freedom that we have in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.780]   Help us, Lord God, to hold on to the gospel so dearly
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.780]   that we would cherish Christ in our lives.
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.780]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.780]   Okay, I'm gonna take a moment to read
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.780]   our Bible passage for us.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   And it says here, "For you were called to freedom, brethren.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.780]   "Only do not turn your freedom
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   "into an opportunity for the flesh.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.780]   "But through love serve one another,
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.780]   "for the whole law is fulfilled in one word.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.780]   "In the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   "But if you bite and devour one another,
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   "take care that you are not consumed by one another.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.780]   "But I say, walk by the Spirit,
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.780]   "and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.780]   "For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit,
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   "and the Spirit against the flesh.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.780]   "For these are in opposition to one another,
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.780]   "so that you may not do the things that you please.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.780]   "But if you are led by the Spirit,
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   "you are not under the law."
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.780]   So as you take a look at the diagram here,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.780]   and I'm guessing you guys have seen,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   this passage has a lot of explanation, right?
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.780]   Telling you reasons for this, for that,
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.780]   and it has a lot of contrast.
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:15.780]   If you're gonna be in the freedom, then you don't do this.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.780]   But if you don't do this, then you need to be in love.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.780]   And if you, in contrast to love,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   then you're gonna be biting and devouring each other,
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   and it keeps going like that, okay?
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   It's like a flow of thought contrasting
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   what is the will of God versus your flesh.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   As a way of overview,
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.780]   I highlight for you guys just two segments.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   Again, this is just me making observation
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.780]   of where there could be a division in thought.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.780]   Verse 13 through 15,
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   showing us that we need to embrace God's will for us.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   In his freedom that he's given to us,
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   we're free to love, and we ought to say no to the flesh.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.780]   Likewise, we're free to walk in the Spirit
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.780]   and say no to the flesh.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.780]   That's how I get divided into two segments.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   Jumping into today's passage,
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.780]   we need to take a moment to recall
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.780]   that the last segment was pretty intense, yes?
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.780]   Talking about those who are your opposition,
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.780]   and the challenge to you and me was
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.780]   you should know who they are,
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.780]   not just their doctrines, but who they are,
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.780]   as the people who would desire to make influence in our lives.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.780]   And Apostle Paul said that his desire
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.780]   is that those who are troubling you
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:27.780]   would even go to mutilate themselves.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.780]   And that is a really intense thing to say.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.780]   It almost feels ungodly
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.780]   because shouldn't we love our enemies?
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.780]   Well, his thought is pretty clear.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.780]   It's like no, these individuals who are in the church
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.780]   trying to disturb you, seek out your liberty,
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   and put you back into bondage,
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   it's appropriate for Apostle Paul to feel that way.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.780]   And so we jump into today's segment
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:52.780]   when he says for, and he gives an explanation.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.780]   Why do I say what I say about these individuals?
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.780]   They should mutilate themselves and go all the ways
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.780]   because remember, that idea meant
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.780]   they should be outside the camp.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.780]   They should freely expose themselves and leave
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:08.780]   because they're disturbing you.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.780]   And what's more, another way to put it
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.780]   is not only are they disturbing you,
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.780]   but God himself has called you to freedom.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.780]   Meaning it is in the will of God
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.780]   to bless you so lavishly,
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.780]   he would give to you the freedoms of Christ
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   and the blessings of Christ, yes?
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.780]   And these people would try to undo that.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.780]   These people would try to trouble you from that.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:37.780]   It has been God's desire and it has been his will
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.780]   to cause you to have great, great abundance
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.780]   of life in Christ.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:45.780]   And so I want you guys to think about freedom
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:47.780]   not in just a sense of like,
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.780]   oh, we have rights and liberties,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.780]   but think of it as immense blessing in Christ.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.780]   Another way to summarize our freedom
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   is an incredible blessing of the vibrancy of life,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.780]   the power of the resurrection, and more.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:05.780]   And so this passage begins off by explaining to us,
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.780]   this is what you have, okay?
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   Now, we should take a moment to just quickly review.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.780]   I know that we discussed it at length almost
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   in the previous passages and even as an application discussion
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.780]   of how would you define freedom.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.780]   But because there is an interesting play on words here.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.780]   There is this freedom that you have
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.780]   that you've been called to.
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.780]   And then you take this freedom and you're not supposed
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.780]   to make it into an opportunity for your flesh,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.780]   but you're supposed to put yourself under and serve.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.780]   And if you did a study, that idea to serve is doulos,
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.780]   meaning slave, okay?
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.780]   So then we have to ask, what is the idea of freedom?
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.780]   And it's just, I wouldn't say there's one thing,
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   but I want us to understand and just kind of show you
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.780]   that our freedom obviously is a freedom
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   from the tyranny of Satan.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.780]   Freedom from the domain of darkness.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   Freedom from darkness, like blindness and ignorance.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   Freedom from, you know, the curse of the law.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   Freedom from bondage.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.780]   And then there are some other immense personal blessings.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.780]   Freedom from your personal guilt.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   Freedom from the shame you experience because of your sins.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.780]   A freedom from a guilty conscience
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:23.780]   by which you cannot enter into the presence of God, right?
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.780]   So as you look at the other side, freedom too,
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.780]   you're free to approach the throne of God,
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   which is mind-blowing if you think about it.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.780]   Free to learn and hear the revelation,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.780]   the will of the Lord as it unfolds in history.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   Free to live in the household of the Lord,
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   to love the spiritual family.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.780]   Free to experience the blessedness of His promise and more.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:47.780]   And so I want to reiterate that what you have in freedom
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.780]   is essentially a massive, massive blessings in Christ, okay?
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   So the command is, therefore, don't do it.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   Don't be that spoiled child where you get blessed
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   and you immediately turn it into something nasty.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:12.780]   That's the way I summarize, or I guess see, that transition, okay?
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.780]   Don't take the freedom that you have, meaning the blessings that you have,
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   and make it into an opportunity for your flesh.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.780]   Your freedom clearly does not mean, right,
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:27.780]   that somehow there are no expectations on your life.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.780]   Of course you do.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.780]   The book of James talks about how you will actually be judged by the law of liberty.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.780]   God has designed and created you for various purposes to His glory.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:40.780]   Of course you have expectations on your life.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.780]   Obviously, none of us, right, would ever have the gall to say,
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   "You know what? I'm going to live my life and say what I want to say,
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   do what I want to do, and don't you dare tell me otherwise," okay?
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.780]   But as we get into such an applicational portion of the text,
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.780]   I do want to ask a quick applicational question to you, okay?
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.780]   We would never say that because I'm a free Christian,
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   I can just do what I want.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:09.780]   But another way to see if we actually feel that way
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   is to ask the question, "How are your reactions?"
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.780]   How are your reactions when your fellow brother or sister tells you,
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.780]   "Hey, you shouldn't be doing that,"
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.780]   or, "Man, you really should be doing better in your commitments,
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   in your devotion, in your consistency, even in your participation," right?
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   Do you have knee-jerk reactions where it's like,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.780]   "You can't tell me what to do," right?
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.780]   "I didn't do anything wrong."
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   If you do, you're kind of saying it without saying it.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.780]   So we are in an applicational section,
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   and I wanted to ask that question as a check to ourselves,
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.780]   "How are our reactions?"
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.780]   But I want to make a more pointed applicational question to you
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   right there in the middle of verse 13.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   When it tells you not to turn your freedom into opportunity for the flesh,
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.780]   how have you in any way, in any moment where I see the pattern,
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   turned your blessings into opportunity just to gratify yourself?
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.780]   Okay?
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   Definitely you should ask that applicational question.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   In what ways have you turned the blessings of God
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.780]   into moments for your flesh?
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.780]   You know, as I was meditating on that just personally,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:24.780]   I don't know why, like, it took me back to my childhood, you know?
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.780]   As soon as you have an opportunity where you're not in school
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.780]   and you get on spring break, what do you normally do?
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:34.780]   As a kid, it's like binge on movies and video games, right?
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:38.780]   When you get older, there are other blessings and opportunities.
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.780]   When you get your first job and you first taste money,
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   what do we normally do?
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   Most people buy a car, right?
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.780]   What do we normally do when we are afforded certain things and blessings?
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.780]   Do we take them into opportunities?
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:55.780]   And I just realized, you know what, just in humility,
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   that kind of pattern exists.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.780]   If some of us are, you know, in a kind of busyness of life
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:04.780]   and you feel like, "Man, I just had a season, though.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   I worked so hard."
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:11.780]   When you are first afforded your rest, what do you do?
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.780]   Four movies in one day?
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   Finish an entire season?
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   What do we do, okay?
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   It's just something to ask.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   Now, when I think about this, I want to take a moment
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.780]   where we can all gather our hearts and thank and praise the Lord.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:27.780]   Why?
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.780]   Because God has said, knowing that people tend to do this,
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.780]   that his desire is to give us freedom.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:40.780]   Has it been God's desire to keep us underneath the strict tutor all our lives?
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.780]   No.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.780]   He wants you and me to mature.
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.780]   And one of the maturities that we will see is when we have liberty,
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.780]   when we have blessing, what are we going to do with it, right?
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   That's a very, very tangible application that we have here.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   But praise be to God.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.780]   I asked an interesting question like, "Whoa, that's really interesting.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:04.780]   Did God take a fat risk giving freedom to a bunch of people
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   who have a nature prone to laziness, selfishness, greed, and pleasure?"
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:16.780]   As you guys would know, praise be to God, God doesn't take just like risks.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   In his perfect fatherly love, he's sanctifying us.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.780]   Praise be to God, he's going to perfect us.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.780]   Amen?
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:29.780]   Now, as we continue on, I want us to come to this next portion of verse 13
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:35.780]   where it says, "But in contrast to you taking opportunities just to satisfy yourself,
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   through love you ought to serve one another."
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.780]   So the command is there, right?
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.780]   And any time there's a command, I hope you get in a pattern of highlighting it,
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:48.780]   circling it, and ask certain questions like, "Do I understand what he's telling me?
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:50.780]   Do I understand the motivation?
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   And do I know how I'm practically going to do it?"
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.780]   Right?
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.780]   Okay.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.780]   As we think about that, you guys, if you've done a word study on the word love,
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.780]   it is the word agape, right?
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.780]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:08.780]   It would have sufficed for him to say, "I want you to love people."
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:14.780]   But he adds another term that he wants you to, through love, serve one another.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.780]   And that's the one I want to take a little bit of time on.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   You guys have probably heard that agape is a strong form of love
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.780]   where it's unconditional, sacrificial, not contingent upon superficial things
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.780]   like what you can do, how you look, and what status you are.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:33.780]   But here the challenge goes deeper for us, right?
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:40.780]   Because it says, "Rather than taking the blessings as a cue for you to now go live it up,
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.780]   he wants you to voluntarily become a servant of other people."
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:52.780]   Look at this, the idea of the verb to--the verb comes from the noun doulos,
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.780]   which means servant or slave, and it's to be in a position of servitude,
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.780]   to act accordingly, and to subject yourself.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.780]   What a challenge.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.780]   What a challenge to all of us.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.780]   And I want to say, again, by way of application,
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   one of the more poignant signs of biblical maturity
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.780]   is not that you know theology and can teach.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:18.780]   As a matter of fact, you can teach all you want and be incredibly what?
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.780]   Selfish.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.780]   You get annoyed that people aren't meeting up to certain standards
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:24.780]   because it annoys you.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.780]   You want people to be better because in the end that serves you.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   You're challenging other people to be submissive, servant-like, etc.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780]   Why?
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.780]   Because somehow that serves your end.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.780]   Who do you love most in that kind of scenario?
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.780]   Yourself.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.780]   But rather maturity is often reflected in an ability to subject yourself
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:53.780]   no matter who it is you're serving, to fulfill Christ's love for an individual.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:58.780]   Moving forward to verse 14 and 15, it's all a part of that first segment
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   where you're free to love.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.780]   We say yes to love that God has designed us to do and say no to the flesh.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.780]   What's really interesting is in verse 14 it says the whole law
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.780]   is fulfilled in one word in the statement,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:15.780]   "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:20.780]   He explains to us that these individuals who claim to be like,
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.780]   "We need to obey the law for righteousness,"
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:28.780]   and these people who are trying to get everybody to do a simple act
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:32.780]   of both ritual and tradition for the sake of entering into the kingdom,
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:37.780]   he's essentially rebuking them like, "If you really understood the law,
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.780]   you would know that God's intent was for love
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:46.780]   because the law reminded us of the great kindness and the love of God."
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.780]   So by way of just level of conviction,
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.780]   you know that the great command for you and me in this side of the cross,
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.780]   Christ said this in John 13,
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.780]   "A new commandment I give to you that you love one another
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.780]   even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.780]   By this all men will know that you are my disciples
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.780]   if you have love for one another."
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.780]   So as we are entering into a very applicational portion,
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.780]   I'm just going to talk to different pockets of our church people.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.780]   Some of you are anti-social.
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.780]   May the love of Christ compel you.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:33.780]   Some of you, you like nature, cars, tech, animals more than people.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.780]   More than people.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.780]   May the love of Christ compel you.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:45.780]   Christ said that it's not just simply your ability to love anything,
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   it's your ability to love people.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.780]   Yes, even fallen ones.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   Yes, even people who fall from your standards, whatever it may be.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:02.780]   But God has told us that our love for the people around us,
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.780]   especially when it's at our own sacrifice,
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:08.780]   causes Him to be happy.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.780]   Amen?
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.780]   The Father delights to see us love the brethren.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:17.780]   What's more, I want to talk to another portion of the people.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:21.780]   I would classify myself not as an anti-social person,
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.780]   but more of a people pleaser.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:27.780]   What we as people pleasers do,
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.780]   I'm just assuming there's a bunch of you out there,
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:33.780]   the same boat as I am, is not love.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.780]   Let me repeat that.
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:39.780]   This generation is so self-centered,
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.780]   they constantly just cater to people all the time.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:47.780]   You want to be happy? Sure, I'll do it.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.780]   You want to ask this of me? Okay.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.780]   Just giving people what they want is not love.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:56.780]   Because if I am pleasing you so that you would accept me,
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   who do I love?
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:59.780]   Me.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.780]   That's the logic, yes?
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   True Christianity, true love of Christ,
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:08.780]   does good according to the will of God, amen?
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.780]   Everything is in context from God's perspective.
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.780]   So the Scripture is challenging us.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.780]   Fulfill the love of Christ.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   Love as I love.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.780]   Love as Christ loves.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.780]   That's the challenge to us.
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:25.780]   Now, I don't think this needs to be said,
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.780]   but in verse 14, it is interesting that, again,
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:32.780]   he quotes Old Testament, I think, to rebuke the people.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.780]   Do you guys really, like, know the Old Testament?
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.780]   Are you guys reading it?
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.780]   Because you would know it's not about your self-righteousness,
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.780]   it's about love, right?
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:44.780]   But notice how this passage does mention this idea
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.780]   of you shall love your neighbor as yourself,
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.780]   and I'm going to ask a silly question.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.780]   Do we need to love self first before we love other people?
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.780]   To this group, I know it doesn't need to be said,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   but sometimes people talk like that.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.780]   But as a reminder to you, the reason why this passage,
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:04.780]   both from Leviticus, when quoted in Matthew 5,
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.780]   when quoted here, is because the idea is
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:13.780]   we already love ourselves way too much.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.780]   It's already a given that we have as our first priority
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:20.780]   our own well-being, our first preservation, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   But God, he desires to see love for others in that vein.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   Okay, now in thinking through this, verse 15,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.780]   in verse 15, there's a warning, okay?
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.780]   There is a warning that rather than loving yourself,
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   you have to be loving others.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.780]   Why?
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   Because in so doing, you're going to ruin the whole thing.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   What is the warning here?
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.780]   In verse 15, it says, "If you bite and devour one another,
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:55.780]   "take care that you are not consumed by one another."
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:59.780]   Now, I think that little portion where it says, "Take care," right?
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.780]   It may kind of throw you off.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:04.780]   It's like, what is this passage actually saying, you know?
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.780]   But in contrast, if you guys remember just a couple passages ago,
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   it talked about how a little leaven ruins the whole dough, yes?
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:17.780]   This is the same admonishment, essentially.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:20.780]   If you give in to the ideology that you get to do whatever you want
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.780]   because you're blessed,
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.780]   if you think that Christianity means you're kind of free
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.780]   because you can sin and you're going to be forgiven,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.780]   and there is an element of cheap grace,
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:36.780]   what that eventually turns into is a kind of licentious living
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   where it's all about you.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.780]   And what kind of fruit do you think is born?
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.780]   In legalism, the kind of fruit that's born is self-righteousness.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.780]   In licentious living, the kind of fruit that's born is self-preservation.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.780]   I secure my own, I secure myself, I secure my rights,
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.780]   I secure my well-being,
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   and what ends up happening is people devour each other.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.780]   That's what it's saying.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.780]   Don't you understand where this is going to lead to?
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.780]   So, I'm not going to go into all the details of what does it mean to bite
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.780]   and what does it mean to devour.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.780]   Essentially, it's like a strange play on words
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.780]   that means you're just going to eat each other up.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.780]   You're going to be like wild beasts out there in the wilderness,
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.780]   just working off of instinct.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.780]   You just do whatever you want and watch what the animals do.
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.780]   They kill each other.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.780]   They end up eating each other. Dog-eat-dog world, right?
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:33.780]   And so, I wanted to just highlight a quick passage
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.780]   that when the Scripture warns us about the false teachers
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.780]   who are going to essentially teach us the spirit of the age,
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   it says in 2 Peter 2,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.780]   "And especially those who indulge in the flesh,
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.780]   in corrupt desires and despise authority, daring, self-willed,
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.780]   they do not tremble when they revile against angelic majesties,
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.780]   whereas angels who are greater in might and power
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:59.780]   do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:03.780]   But these like unreasoning animals born as creatures of instinct
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:09.780]   to be captured and killed, reviling where they have no knowledge."
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.780]   So, this is the spirit.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   If we kind of think about our modern generation,
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.780]   and you think about like what is the mantra,
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.780]   what is the kind of ideology of the day,
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:26.780]   it literally is do whatever makes you happy, right?
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:30.780]   And anything that doesn't make you happy, remove far from your midst.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.780]   You would think an ideology of people,
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.780]   like a generation of people who are living by that ideology,
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.780]   that maybe they would be happier.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.780]   Okay, then do what you want.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   Whatever floats your boat, I guess you'd be happy, right?
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   Do you see happiness in our generation?
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:48.780]   It's like hard not to comment on our current generation
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:51.780]   and the tenor and tide of our generation
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.780]   because we live in such an angry, almost paranoid generation
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.780]   where people are constantly feeling attacked.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   They're like paranoid that someone's going to violate their rights
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.780]   and violate who they are.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   And people are essentially fighting each other nonstop.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:09.780]   Where do you think that came from?
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:13.780]   It came from this do whatever you feel like kind of mentality.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:18.780]   Moving forward then, in contrast to the spirit of the age,
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:21.780]   in contrast to living by the flesh,
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.780]   the scripture says to us, "But I say, walk by the spirit,
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:29.780]   and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.780]   For the flesh sets its desire against the spirit,
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.780]   and the spirit against the flesh.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.780]   For these are in opposition to each other,
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:41.780]   so that you may not do the things that you please."
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.780]   Take a moment to talk through this and say,
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:48.780]   "You know this command, 'Walk by the spirit,' right?
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.780]   It's such a big bucket.
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:53.780]   And I definitely hope that you guys, when you were talking through your observation,
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.780]   asked the question, 'Do I really understand what that means?'"
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.780]   What are some synonymous concepts
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.780]   through just a systematic study of the Bible or other passages
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.780]   that will help me understand what it means to walk in the spirit?
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:10.780]   Clearly the scripture tells you,
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.780]   "I want the word of God to richly dwell in you, right?
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.780]   I want you to grow in wisdom, understanding, discernment."
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:22.780]   Why? Because blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.780]   but rather he's going to be meditating on the word of God
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.780]   and let it nourish his soul. Amen?
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:33.780]   Scripture talks so much about what it means to walk daily as children of light,
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:36.780]   mimicking Christ, and I hope that we have an ability,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.780]   I hope that you guys have an ability,
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.780]   to describe that in a succinct way.
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:45.780]   I think every Christian should be able to articulate,
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:50.780]   "This is what it means for me to walk near and consistently with my God,
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.780]   to be in tune and receive the benefits of the spirit."
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.780]   Amen?
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   Now, in thinking about this and how do we do it,
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:01.780]   I want to make brief mention of the fact
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:05.780]   that there is an active nature to this, but also a passive nature to this.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.780]   Or, better yet, another way to think about it is
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.780]   there's an active walking where you are fighting,
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.780]   but there's also a surrendering and following.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:18.780]   We know we ought to pray unceasingly, as the scripture says,
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.780]   in all seasons, in every way, different types of prayers.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.780]   And there are so many things you could be doing.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.780]   But also, you guys know,
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.780]   that there's an element to which a big part of you walking
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:33.780]   is you surrendering and patiently waiting.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.780]   And those of you who are constantly trying to secure your blessings,
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.780]   and you're constantly trying to manipulate what's going on in your life,
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:46.780]   there is like a cease and desist order for you to trust God.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:51.780]   That is a big part of you walking in the spirit.
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.780]   And then just for reference,
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:58.780]   this whole idea of walking in the spirit is referenced in Romans 8, 5-13.
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.780]   Let's take a moment there and read it together very briefly.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:07.780]   So turn your Bibles over to Romans 8, 5-13.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:14.780]   And this passage kind of expands for us this idea of the flesh versus the spirit.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:18.780]   And this is what the Word of God says.
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:25.780]   It says, "For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:28.780]   but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:33.780]   For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.780]   Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God,
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.780]   for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.780]   And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:50.780]   However, you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if indeed the spirit of God dwells in you.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:55.780]   But if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:02.780]   If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.780]   But if the spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:11.780]   He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.780]   through His spirit who dwells in you.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:19.780]   So then, brethren, we are under obligation not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:23.780]   For if you are living according to the flesh, you must die.
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:29.780]   But if by the spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:34.780]   Okay, so let's take a moment to talk about this real briefly.
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:41.780]   This portion that we just read in Romans 5 highlighted for us the conflict between our flesh and the spirit, right?
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:46.780]   And the way it said it was, "I want you guys to understand how desperately you need the spirit."
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   Because if you think now that you're a Christian that things are supposed to happen naturally for you,
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   you're mistaken.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:00.780]   Your flesh has set itself against your spirit and the things of God.
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.780]   It will fight you.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   And essentially, that's what he's saying here.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:13.780]   Verse 17 is telling you the reality is your flesh as a decaying piece of the body in which it is now encasing you,
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:17.780]   and God is going to shed that so that you'll be glorified in the flesh,
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:21.780]   you will have a glorified body in heaven, right?
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:24.780]   But in this time, it is completely against you.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:29.780]   So we know that our enemy, Satan, is attacking us.
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:31.780]   His demons can attack us.
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.780]   This fallen world can attack us.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:39.780]   The fallen world and its ideologies can attack us, but so can our flesh, okay?
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:45.780]   So in thinking about that, first just kind of way of application.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:51.780]   When we think about how we're doing, I want to just give you guys a challenge.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:58.780]   Sometimes I hear a lot of times where people will say, "Hey, you know, these days I'm doing pretty good."
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.780]   When they're asked, "How are you doing spiritually?" they'll say, "I'm doing pretty good."
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:04.780]   And then they'll admit, like, "Ah, but there are compromises here.
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.780]   Maybe me and my, you know, significant other, we're crossing boundaries.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:14.780]   I'm sometimes, like, watching explicit stuff on the Internet, but overall I'm doing pretty good."
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.780]   Don't talk like that, right?
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:24.780]   If you're compromising in the flesh and feeding it, you're not doing good just because it's few.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.780]   Why? That flesh is not going to be satisfied.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.780]   It's going to be fed, right?
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:35.780]   So we should be thinking red alarm, yellow alert, I am susceptible.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   Does that make sense?
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:43.780]   What we should be saying is, "Man, the fight is real, and it's getting really intense."
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:52.780]   What's more, I want to talk to, again, by way of application, those of you who are maybe, like, newer to the faith, right, younger Christians.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:57.780]   I know that a lot of us sometimes feel so frustrated, right?
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   "Oh my goodness, how can I ascend so soon?
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:07.780]   Just the other week I went to, you know, a praise night," or, "Oh my goodness, like, Sunday was just the other day.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.780]   How can I fall so easily, so soon, and so severely?"
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.780]   And you may be so discouraged.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:17.780]   It doesn't even have to be somebody who's young in the faith.
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.780]   You may have been a Christian a long time.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.780]   You probably feel that way at certain moments in your life, right?
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.780]   May we be encouraged by this passage.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:31.780]   We know and we believe the Holy Spirit is in you.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.780]   Amen?
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:43.780]   When you focus way too much on your failure, we almost hesitate to say, "I have the Holy Spirit that was at creation,
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:49.780]   that guided the writing of the Scriptures, the inerrant, infallible Scriptures,
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.780]   the Holy Spirit who is our comforter, who is our convictor and our helper in times of need.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.780]   He is in us." Amen?
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.780]   And what this passage in Romans chapter 8 and what this passage is telling us
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:07.780]   is when He comes first, then indirectly we will not follow the desires of our flesh.
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.780]   We have to believe that.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.780]   We have to be convinced of that.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.780]   There is an indirect solution.
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:21.780]   We know that when we are building a deep, healthy, intimate, consistent and nourished relationship with Christ,
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:28.780]   walking with the Spirit, clinging to His every word, indirectly the sin will fade.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:32.780]   Indirectly the temptation will subside.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:42.780]   And so, if you are a young Christian, don't be so discouraged and bewildered like, "Oh my gosh, what's happening?
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:47.780]   I just thought that if I confessed it once, then boom, it's supposed to happen."
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:53.780]   You know that it's going to happen in this way where we invest heavily into walking with the Lord.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:35:02.780]   So, by way of conclusion, in verse 18, it says, "So if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.780]   And I want to wrap up with this.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   That portion is kind of interesting because we could bypass it as like,
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.780]   "Hey, we've been talking so much about how you're not under the law. I get it."
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:14.780]   And then you just pass on, right?
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.780]   But is that what he's talking about?
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.780]   "Hey, you don't have to obey the law for righteousness anymore."
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.780]   I think this is a little bit different, right?
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:27.780]   He's comparing and contrasting how daily you're supposed to be led,
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:31.780]   and therefore you're not underneath the law, right?
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:37.780]   One is seen as kind of like a general way of righteousness, etc.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   But here I want to talk about this and just give you an example.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:47.780]   My guess is a bunch of you guys play sports, and sometimes when you are a newbie in playing sports,
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.780]   when you're young, what do you most often feel?
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:55.780]   You often feel kind of awkward. You don't know what you're doing, right?
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:03.780]   A lot of times for a newbie player, what becomes the greatest hindrance to them actually playing is fear.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:07.780]   Fear of what? I'm going to mess up, right?
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.780]   I'm going to mess up. I'm not going to do a good job.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.780]   People are going to laugh, and it's going to be miserable, okay?
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:17.780]   And then when somebody from the outside watching, it's kind of frustrating.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:23.780]   It's like, "Just go for it. Just hit it. It doesn't matter, right? Just try."
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:27.780]   And in that way, you guys understand, if you're led in the spirit, you're already in the game.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.780]   The game is won. Just try.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:35.780]   If you're focused on your failure and you're focused on the fear, what are you doing
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.780]   but completely just stop blocking whatever is progress for you already?
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:44.780]   And so likewise, I want to give you just a challenge and encouragement.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:48.780]   For us, the game is already won.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.780]   For us, we have victory.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:54.780]   For us, we have the Spirit of God.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:59.780]   And in that way, perhaps maybe a lot of us may just sympathize with the disciples
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:05.780]   when Jesus said to them, "I know your spirit is willing, but your flesh is so weak.
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:10.780]   But nevertheless, we believe that the Spirit who is in us is greater,
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:14.780]   is greater than all our failures, and is greater than anything that's in the world."
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.780]   Amen? Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:24.780]   Lord God, we thank you for the challenge and the encouragement today.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.780]   We know, Lord, that it has been your design for us to be filled with your love to such a degree
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.780]   that, God, we would freely just give it.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:37.780]   I pray, Father God, that you would help us live as ones
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:44.780]   who are not looking for more satisfaction because we already are blessed.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:47.780]   We already have everything in Christ.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.780]   And so I ask, God, that we can give, and then we would feel what the Scripture says,
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.780]   that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.780]   And, Lord, we would mimic you in that kind of lavish self-sacrifice.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.780]   I also pray, Lord, you would teach us what it means, day by day,
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:06.780]   to walk in the Spirit, to be renewed in the Spirit,
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.780]   and, God, not to live with our head down, constantly afraid of failure.
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.780]   I pray, Father God, that you would cause us to live in victory.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.780]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:32.780]   All right. So we're going to just do a quick announcement here.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:38.780]   And then you guys can get into your questions or discussions.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:50.780]   All right. Just by way of a reminder, I want to thank you guys,
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.780]   the brothers who have been parking farther away,
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.780]   so that we can give the sisters the closer parking lots.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.780]   But please continue to do that. The shuttle service is going to run.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:05.780]   And so please let the sisters park closer.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:08.780]   The only announcement that I really want to highlight,
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:12.780]   the Women's Conference has been announced, you guys, that's this Saturday.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:17.780]   The membership class, if you're not a member, but you want to be a member at the church,
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:23.780]   it starts this next Sunday, the 21st, at 9.30 in the youth group room over there.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   The thing that I want to highlight is we have a members' meeting at 2 p.m.,
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:30.780]   which is mandatory. So if you can't make it, you already know,
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:33.780]   and it's a legitimate reason. We do keep track of this.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:39.780]   So if you've steadily missed a bunch, someone will probably give you an e-mail.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:45.780]   But it is mandatory where we actually do share with you the different things that are happening in the church.
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:50.780]   For this one, in order to kind of help you with a lunch,
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:58.780]   our Korea missions team for the summer is going to have a meal ready for you for $10 as a fundraiser.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:04.780]   And in addition to that, our cafe is serving for that day strawberry matcha.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:10.780]   No, strawberry lattes and matcha, something, something special.
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:16.780]   But that is – so typically we ask for your coffee drink.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:21.780]   We do suggest a donation, so we're not losing money serving you coffee.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.780]   But that day it's going to be specifically for a fundraiser.
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:28.780]   So the drinks on that day are going to be for that.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:36.780]   So a lunch and coffee service will be right before the members' meeting, so just please do keep that in mind.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:43.780]   We have about 400 people signed up for the abortion birth control IVF seminar,
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:49.780]   but we do need a good headcount for the child care and for refreshments.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.780]   So if you haven't done so already but you're planning on coming to that, please do sign up.
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:02.780]   There are two sessions that are different, and it's going to be a part one and part two with refreshments in the middle.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.780]   So those are the things that are coming up.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.780]   All the other stuff you can look online.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   But again, the emphasis is if you're not a member but you want to be one,
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:13.780]   the eight-week membership, of course, starts next week.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:15.780]   Okay? All right.
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:18.780]   Thank you.
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:39.780]   [end of transcript]
