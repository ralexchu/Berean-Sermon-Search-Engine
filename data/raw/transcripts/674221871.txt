[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   Hi, my name is Tim Tang and I'll be sharing my testimony today.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.080]   I'm the youngest boy, and only boy of three, and I grew up in a single mother household
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.920]   while visiting my father on occasion.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.280]   The messiness of the divorce left a lasting wound in the whole family, me included.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000]   Throughout elementary school, my parents would take me to church habitually.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.560]   I did the usual Christian kid experience, BBS, Sunday school, etc.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.520]   Even so, I did not understand what was going on around me, and that feeling changed when
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.640]   my parents left to China, they did for separate reasons.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.480]   I began hopping around different auntie, uncles' houses, church parents, and at this time,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.320]   my youth group pastor took a stint taking care of me and introduced me to Christ.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880]   I bought into the idea that Christ is my savior and started attending church due to an overwhelmingly
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.040]   love that my pastor shared with me.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.760]   However, my understanding of Christ was not founded on the Bible.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.520]   I had my own understanding of the Bible that would lead me astray throughout high school.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.160]   While living in sin, whether it was drinking, drugs, partying, I became reliant on false
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   pretenses I had of Christ, that Christ wanted me to succeed, that I suffered enough through
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.160]   life and Christ will pour his care over me in the way I desired.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240]   In actuality, though, I lived two lives, the church me and secular me.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.860]   I was serving two masters.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.440]   Before my freshman year of college, these misconceptions of the Lord came to a head,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.640]   and I noticed the holes in my faith.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.680]   I started to look for the meaning of my faith in the word and trusted false teachers of
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   the word.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.720]   I became involved with Shincheonji, a Korean cult led by Man-hee Lee.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   Their knowledge of the word surpassed anyone I met thus far and is still better than most
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.480]   brothers and sisters I know.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.520]   In reality, they twisted the word by discrediting the Holy Spirit and instead claiming their
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.400]   church is the only church that has the truth.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.480]   John 14.26 says, "But the advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.880]   my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you."
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.160]   For a year, I unknowingly learned how to cherry pick the word and twist the word to take the
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   Holy Spirit out of the equation and replace it with false teachings.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.600]   My experience with the cult soured continually as my intimacy with the Lord lessened.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.480]   By the grace and guidance of the Holy Spirit, I started to find small holes in their arguments,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.880]   inconsistencies from other verses, and I left the cult unsure of where I stood with my faith
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.320]   and where was God in all of this.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   I wondered why God led me down this road that would make me question his existence.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.120]   I would look at my previous experiences of my faith and the word with a sour feeling
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.000]   that was impressed to me by the cult.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.280]   I decided to forego my relationship with the Lord due to this turmoil.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360]   I did everything in my power to fill a Christ-shaped hole in my heart.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.560]   I started an extremely successful business selling computer components.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   I went back to drinking and forsook my connection with the church.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.600]   I lived amidst my sin for a year and a bit, hoping my pain and guilt would go away.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.080]   I thought I could live a life content with the omission of Christ.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.800]   But when quarantine started, my business was shut down, and I was alone with myself in
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.640]   my apartment in Irvine, and I went crazy a little bit just from staying at home by myself.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.240]   However, I had time to reflect on my spiritual health, and nothing could fill or fit the
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.600]   role of being the center of my life.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.160]   My greed, my deception, pride, envy, malice, the list goes on.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   It all tried and failed to be the center, and all came from a heart that was too scared
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.840]   to put its faith in Christ.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.280]   However, as much as I could draw myself in the world's pleasure, I could not escape
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.840]   the facts laid out in the world that Christ is still searching for me, knocking on my
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680]   door, beckoning me to trust in him and in him alone.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.880]   The almighty God who has died for my transgressions against him is still holding on to me, that
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   my sins pale in comparison to what God has done for me.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   This broke me in every single way possible.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.520]   I never thought I would consider myself Christian again in my life, but my only response was
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.280]   to go back and find him again.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.840]   I started reading the word again, decided to go back to church, and my brothers and
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   sisters at Bernie encouraged me to look through the word myself, not rely on others or my
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   salvation or other people's teachings.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.480]   Through God's endless grace and gentle guidance and many loving rebukes, I learned how to
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.280]   read and apply the word in my life.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.360]   This led to a true understanding of what Christ has done, that he calls me to surrender all
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.160]   I am, not just my sin.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.440]   I finally understand that Christ is my Lord and Savior.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.800]   I have found my hope, my faith, my love in the aftermath of the cross.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.480]   I still have much to grow, but I finally understand my calling to continue to love my God with
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.960]   all I am, sin, brokenness, and all.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.800]   I am no longer lost amidst the solution of the word and that Christ has loved me all
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   this time.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   Thank you.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   [Applause]
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   [Applause]
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   [APPLAUSE]
