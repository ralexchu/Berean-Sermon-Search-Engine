[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.020]   [ Background noise ]
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.600]   I'll give you guys about a minute to wrap it up.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:58.980]   [ Background noise ]
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.980]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:30.960]   [ Background noise ]
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.940]   All right.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.860]   I'm going to get started.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.060]   If you could join me in prayer, I'm going to ask the Lord
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840]   to just minister to us in the next,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.000]   just this part of our Bible study.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.240]   All right, let's pray together.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.480]   Lord, we thank you for your word, and we thank you
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.460]   for giving us the freedom and all the tools to die deeply.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.560]   And in this deep dive, sometimes we end
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.960]   up with a lot more questions than we do answers.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.700]   And we pray that as you feed us, that more than anything
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.860]   that we would hunger for more.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.800]   I pray that you would guide our time, that you would help
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.920]   to clarify and illuminate various aspects of this text
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.400]   for our limited understanding,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.420]   and help us to be led into all truth.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.720]   And so, Lord, we ask that you would help us to process
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.140]   through this passage and other passages like it,
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.720]   to grow in appreciation of the doctrine of salvation.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.020]   So, we thank you, Lord, for just our time together,
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.700]   and we entrust this time into your hands.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.160]   Amen. So, when I first started asking my questions
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.020]   for this passage, I actually had a hard time.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.460]   Because this seemed like almost a passage that I should be able
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.520]   to just rehearse and recite, like, at length.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   And when you read it quickly,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.740]   it's like stuff you've already seen before.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.380]   But then when you dive deeply,
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.900]   you kind of don't know what to ask.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.520]   So, I was like, all my questions started sounding
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.880]   like what is justification?
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.900]   What is regeneration?
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.740]   What is renewing?
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.760]   Anyone else have that similar, like, I don't know
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.860]   where to begin, there's so much meat here, right?
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.120]   So, that's normal.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.560]   I would encourage you guys, as much as you can,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.400]   do not go into a commentary.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.620]   Do not use a study Bible, because that's kind
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.660]   of a cheating way, all right?
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.740]   So, for our Titus study,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.320]   do your best to do all the dirty work, okay?
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.180]   So, what you want to do is, you want to let scripture interpret
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.380]   scripture, so you want to just dive deep, and you want to dig.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.980]   And after you've done a whole bunch of digging,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.560]   and then you're kind of still confused,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.100]   then consult a commentary.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.080]   But don't start there, all right?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.220]   So, what you want to do is look at the passage,
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.040]   look at the context, and then look at other related books
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.420]   in the Bible, and then even some, like,
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.640]   Greek word studies if you need to, okay?
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.320]   And so, when I do this, it doesn't look this pretty,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.400]   because it's just usually just all over the place.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.440]   But I did this so that you can see how I break it
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.260]   down in my head, okay?
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.240]   And I modified it a little bit from last week.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.540]   The yellows on the side
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.300]   for this whole section are three imperatives,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.160]   and one infinitive, basically saying,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.720]   this is what Paul wants Titus to do, all right?
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.860]   And then, I look at the green, I just put,
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.740]   these are important words that I need to kind
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.740]   of keep my eyes focused on, the buts, and the fors,
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.960]   and the therefores, and things.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.760]   And the blue in the middle is what we're looking at today,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.920]   and a lot of this is just literally what we have been
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.340]   saved from, how we have been saved, and what that means.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.300]   What's our new identity, and what we have been saved for, okay?
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.680]   And then, that highlight in the, like, the light blue,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.940]   that's the reward, right?
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.220]   That's kind of the product of all of this.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.240]   And so, that's actually very important, and a lot of fun
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.960]   to just dwell on and think of, okay?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.120]   And then, I've shared this with you in the past,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   that this is like the third section of dense theology, okay?
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.160]   So, we had that in chapter one, we have that in chapter two,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.560]   and now that's our passage today.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.880]   Every single one of these sections emphasizes, like,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.560]   an appearance of Christ.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.940]   So, you guys notice that?
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.680]   You know the word appearing, epiphaneia,
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   that's only used four times in the whole New Testament,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.840]   but half of those times are in Titus, so that's significant.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.000]   So, there's an appearing and a manifestation of Christ
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   here in the pink.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.720]   It emphasizes again and again and again that Jesus and God
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.680]   are our Savior, no other epistle does it like that.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.880]   Okay, if you guys have poured through the Bible,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.360]   only in Titus is God and Jesus constantly called our Savior,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   and there's a reason, because salvation's pretty important,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   right, to all the good deeds that we're supposed to do, okay?
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.960]   And Jesus being our Savior, that's deliberate,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.160]   because there's so much application in Titus, right?
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.400]   All of chapter two is just a big application.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   And if we try to apply them by ourselves,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.560]   we're gonna be missing the whole point.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   So, that's why there's so much doctrine in here.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.080]   And all of this has, like, a future focus.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   You guys notice?
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.480]   Okay, our identity as heirs and as the bride of Christ.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.840]   Okay, so John Stott calls chapter three,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.560]   verses four through seven, like, the fullest statement
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.640]   of salvation in the whole New Testament.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.040]   So, today, we looked at, like, one of the most, like,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.600]   rich, dense pictures of our salvation.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.120]   And so, a few weeks back, if you guys recall,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.600]   I walked you through this thing called the Ordo Salutis.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Okay, the Ordo Salutis does not come out of Titus,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.400]   and it's actually coming from the whole of Scripture.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.080]   And Titus doesn't dictate this order, all right?
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.480]   So, I wanna quiz you guys on this.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.640]   Remember, every Christian reveres Christ Jesus.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.320]   All saints preach Deo Gloria.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   All right, so, you guys remember all of these?
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.600]   Go through it in your head.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   E.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.800]   Okay, give some people some time,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   'cause some people's brains are working slower.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.320]   It's 8/27, okay?
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   C.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.440]   Call.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.120]   R.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.680]   Regeneration.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.600]   C.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.880]   There's a conversion, and what's a J?
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.440]   Justification, all right?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.480]   Some of you guys, you're like, your brains,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.640]   you're like, oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.480]   A.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.040]   Adoption.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.880]   S.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.640]   Sanctification.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.000]   P.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.840]   Perseverance.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.240]   D is death, and then G is glorification.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.560]   And election, call, regeneration, conversion, justification.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.520]   Adoption, sanctification, perseverance,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.840]   death, and glorification.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.680]   And this is, some of these are instantaneous
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.440]   and kind of coupled together,
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   but this is how we would say how someone is saved, okay?
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   And just from Titus, we see glimpses of these processes.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.360]   All three of the little theological passages
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.480]   that we looked at talk about the first five, okay?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.440]   Not necessarily in order.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.760]   And then the sanctification and perseverance
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.800]   is all over Titus, where we need to live sensibly,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.080]   righteously, and devoutly in this present age,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.480]   and we need to do good deeds and be godly, right?
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.880]   And that's actually next to all of the theological stuff,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.560]   there's an emphasis on godliness.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.320]   Do you guys notice this?
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.760]   Here's a bunch of theology, zealous for good deeds,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.200]   a bunch of theology, like engage and be careful
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.440]   for good deeds.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.520]   Not sure as if you guys, you pick that up.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.240]   So there is a connection there, all right?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.160]   So you can't be theologically literate
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.520]   and just say good deeds aren't important
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   because they're always packed together, all right?
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   And then the death and glorification part,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.760]   which is the bonus and which is the good stuff,
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   in the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.080]   promised long ages ago, and that's also in each section.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.000]   So this Ordo Salutis I gave to you a couple weeks back
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.600]   to kind of help you also set up for tonight, okay?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.960]   But Titus doesn't dictate this.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.680]   And there are slight variations
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.800]   depending on your theological framework,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.880]   but this is the one I would subscribe to,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.720]   and that's just as a review.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.360]   Now, I'm looking at today's passage
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.720]   I'm not gonna give you any answers
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.640]   or anything that's like mind blowing,
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.280]   but I'm gonna show you what I catch with my eye, all right?
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   So I immediately noticed like, man,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.480]   the he saved us is the big one.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.320]   It's the main point.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.240]   So I just, boop, I pulled it out, okay?
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.560]   That but I wanna keep in mind
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.880]   because my previous identity was described up to verse three.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.840]   And then if you see this little column,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.400]   this kind of is all a part of how God saved us.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   And that's why I just kind of divvied it up this way, all right?
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.520]   Or what aspect of God caused salvation, all right?
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.960]   So verses four through seven, it's one Greek sentence.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.400]   You guys might have already talked about that.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.240]   I see seven facets of salvation.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.920]   Some people say six, some people say eight,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.280]   but for me it's like seven.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.960]   And every facet of salvation is initiated
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.560]   and empowered by God alone.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.960]   All active verbs attributed to God,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   all passive verbs attributed to man.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.440]   And if you guys haven't realized this yet,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360]   but the Christian faith is the only one
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.800]   where we are saved this way, right?
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.080]   So it seems too good to be true.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.280]   But in all other religious paradigms,
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.640]   you have to earn your salvation,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.320]   whatever that means, by your deeds.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.720]   The Christian faith makes it very simple.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.360]   You can't, right?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   It's all, you're a passive person in this, okay?
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.520]   So theological and eschatological,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.680]   this whole section, it's not chronological.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   So if you're trying to figure out,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.440]   oh, where does this fit in the order of saluties?
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.280]   Hey, PPC, you gave us the wrong order.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.720]   No, no, no, that's not the point of this.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.840]   This is all, bam, dense theology, all right?
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   And so with chapter two and with the stuff
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.160]   that's gonna come next week and the following week,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.720]   why we can expect Christians to have a social conscience
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   and to behave responsibly in public life, all right?
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.880]   It is important that you live like a Christian, okay?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.000]   Not to earn your salvation, but as a response.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.560]   And that's in the text.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   Now, verse four, it talks about the kindness of God,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.880]   our Savior, and his love for mankind.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.800]   So I look at kindness of God, okay?
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.880]   I look through some word study.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.980]   I realize this is the word only used by Paul.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.080]   No one else uses it.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.880]   And Romans 2:4 immediately comes to my mind, right?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.100]   Have you not, do you not realize it's the kindness of God
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.720]   that leads you to repentance?
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.600]   Did you guys know that you cannot preach a gospel message
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.760]   without this call to repentance?
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.000]   So modern day, a lot of churches give you a gospel
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.160]   without the importance of repentance.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.680]   But it's his kindness that leads us to repentance, okay?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.480]   That causes us to be aware of our sin.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.520]   So no conversion without repentance.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.120]   Is that clear?
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.080]   Like, biblically, there is no conversion without a repenting,
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   a turning away from your sin.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.160]   So the second thing that I see is there's a love
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.920]   for mankind, and this is a little puzzling.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.960]   The Greek word is philanthropia.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.140]   Occurs only twice in the New Testament,
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.920]   but only here in reference to God's character, okay?
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.960]   So immediately theological questions come to my mind, okay?
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.240]   Well, predestination comes to my mind.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.000]   Election comes to my mind.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Did God love all mankind, or did he love only his elect?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.360]   Did he die for all mankind,
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.500]   or did he only die for the elect?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.040]   Can he send someone to hell still with a heart of love?
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.820]   Because the Bible does say God hates sin, right?
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.900]   But there are cases where, like the rich young ruler,
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.360]   where the man apparently doesn't believe,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   and he walks away from Jesus,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.660]   but what does it say, that Jesus loves him, right?
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.160]   So this word is a little bit puzzling for me,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.760]   because of a theological idea I have in my head
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.440]   called reprobation.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.640]   And what that is is the sovereign decision of God
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.320]   before creation to pass over some persons in sorrow,
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.920]   deciding not to save them and to punish them for their sins
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.720]   and thereby to manifest as justice.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.380]   So when you hit a verse like this,
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.680]   there might be like a little theological emotional snag,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.200]   right, that you're like, I don't quite see how this fits.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.940]   But when we do inductive study,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.300]   we put a hedge around like the text.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.820]   So how we feel and our opinions and our aversion
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.500]   or our attraction to something, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   We're gonna see, okay, if God is God,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.220]   and he gave us his word, what does he have to say?
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.700]   And certain things are not always easy to grasp or explain.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.840]   But so this word comes to my mind, okay?
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.060]   So I'm charting through.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.120]   Verse five is a meaty one.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.620]   First of all, I notice in the NIV, okay,
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.220]   'cause I don't just take my Bible and open it to the Greek.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.060]   That takes too long, okay?
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.300]   And it's been a while since I was in seminary, all right?
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.240]   But I look at the comparisons, I look at NIV,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.360]   I notice, oh, there's a, he saved us twice.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.300]   Anybody else pick up on that
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.080]   when they were doing their study?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.660]   That's weird, okay?
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.340]   Like, why is that the case?
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.620]   So then I actually looked at the Greek.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.820]   And so I actually have a Bible program called Logos
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.180]   that I use, and it was very expensive, and I use,
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.300]   but a Greek passage like this is available for you
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.760]   on BibleHub.com, it's on the internet,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.600]   where you can actually,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.700]   even if you don't know how to read the Greek,
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.360]   you can read the English word,
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.000]   or the English, the equivalent of it.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And one thing I notice is that he saved us,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:57.960]   where does it come?
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.940]   How many words before the he saved us?
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.120]   14.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.280]   So it comes way later in the sentence, all right?
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.680]   So I go, oh, so the emphasis that he wants to make
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.080]   is all of these things that led to our salvation,
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.100]   and with the highlight being that he saved us,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.260]   and that's why a lot of the translators
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.300]   put it in the beginning,
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.780]   but the NIV decided, oh, we need to remind ourselves
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.100]   of what the point of this whole section is,
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.100]   and so they put the he saved us twice.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.440]   Another thing I notice in chapter three, verse five,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.180]   is in a sentence, you usually don't have four nouns,
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.080]   back to back to back to back, do you?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.380]   Unless there's a comma.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.220]   But at the end of this, I see four nouns
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.580]   that are all genitive nouns,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.340]   which means it's like a possessive noun,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.440]   attributive noun, so I see the washing,
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.220]   regeneration, renewing, and the Holy Spirit are all nouns.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.800]   Huh, interesting, I haven't consulted a commentary yet,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.400]   but I'm like, okay, there's something there,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.460]   and I'm gonna do the work of trying to figure out
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.340]   like what this all means, okay?
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.140]   So four straight genitive nouns,
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.380]   washing, regeneration, renewing, Holy Spirit,
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.060]   and then I'll notice that like
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.300]   righteous deeds has come up again, okay?
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.820]   In chapter two, verse 12,
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.780]   there's a call for us to live righteously,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.980]   and I've studied enough Bible where if I see Paul
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.980]   using the word righteous, I immediately think Old Testament,
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.340]   because so much of what Paul is saying is
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.660]   you guys are trying to live righteously by the old covenant,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.580]   by trying to do outward obedience to God's law,
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.260]   but that's not how you're saved, okay?
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.660]   So whenever Paul's talking about righteousness,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.220]   it points to the fact that man cannot save himself.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.260]   So I go, okay, I'll take a note of that.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.440]   But he saved us, the third element, by his own mercy.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.580]   Have you guys, how many of you guys
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.940]   have ever taken the SATs?
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.860]   How many of you guys took the SATs when there were analogies?
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.860]   It's been a while, I took mine in 1994.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.740]   So I think I did analogies, but I taught analogies, all right?
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.260]   So the question that I have is like,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.340]   well, here's the word mercy,
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.140]   and how is it different from grace?
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.460]   So grace kind of does away with the guilt.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.860]   It's like the sin issue.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.420]   Mercy is more of a response to affliction.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.660]   Okay, so I just think that, and I put that down.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.420]   All right, that's not like some theologically astute,
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.260]   so don't take careful notes, okay?
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.780]   It's like, ooh, grace, guilt, mercy, is like affliction.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.660]   When someone is merciful, when you play softball
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.620]   and you're down 25 to zero, there's a what rule?
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.700]   Mercy rule, you wanna end the suffering.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.420]   Okay, so that, oh, okay, according to his own mercy.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.820]   So I'll take a note of that.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.620]   And I'll notice that there's a washing of regeneration,
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.500]   which scripture usually says in like being born again, okay?
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.180]   That's John 3 language.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.620]   And here's another regeneration.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.700]   So I'll look up maybe a grudem,
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.700]   'cause grudem, the systematic theology,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.300]   it has all these definitions.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.860]   So if I'm not quite sure what regeneration is,
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.020]   I'll look at that.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.980]   And what it says is it's a secret act of God
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.820]   in which he imparts a new spiritual life, okay?
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.980]   So then I'm left with a question.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.900]   Is this internal or is this external?
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.980]   Is it two events or one?
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.580]   So I'll note that.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.620]   And then I go to the next little thing.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.900]   It's a renewal of the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.460]   Okay, so there's a rebirth involved there.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.540]   The Holy Spirit, if you look at Galatians 3.14,
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.300]   was a promise of a blessing made to Abraham.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.740]   Okay, so if you've actually studied
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.980]   through the other epistles and you're like,
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.860]   wait a minute, the promise of the Holy Spirit
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.660]   is like the blessing of Abraham.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.500]   Okay, there's a connection there.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.940]   So I'm gonna write that down.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:18.420]   And then I get to verse six, it says,
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.220]   okay, the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out upon us richly
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.020]   through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.580]   Now at our table, someone asked,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   is this word poured out very common?
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   Is the word poured out very significant?
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.100]   And if I grew up in a Jewish culture, absolutely.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.980]   Okay, there are many, many promises of God to his people
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.580]   that in the last days, he will pour out his spirit
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.460]   on all mankind.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.140]   Okay, and I just put up three there for you.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.180]   It will come about after this that I will pour out my spirit
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.980]   on all mankind and your sons and your daughters
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.620]   will prophesy, sigh, your old men will dream dreams
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.060]   and your young men will see visions.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.940]   Ezekiel 39.29, I will not hide my face from them any longer
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.460]   for I will have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.620]   declares the Lord God, Zechariah 12.10.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.980]   I will pour out on the house of David
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.540]   and on the habitants of Jerusalem,
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.780]   the spirit of grace and supplication.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.460]   Now, so the Holy Spirit is also important in here.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.780]   So I'm gonna start like jotting down,
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.780]   okay, then how does the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.000]   what is his role in my salvation?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.540]   So then I'll think through, okay,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.860]   he convicted me of sin and I became a child of God.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.260]   And then now the result is he's still here.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.820]   Now I have all that I need for life and godliness.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.020]   And that's in Ephesians three,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.480]   second Corinthians three, second Peter one.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.900]   But I also know that Ephesians one 13 to 14 says,
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.700]   he's a guarantee of my inheritance.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.580]   So I'm just jotting down notes.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.460]   Now this isn't like the other Bible studies that I've led.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.140]   The last 10, I'm giving you other stuff,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.540]   but this one I'm just going point by point, right?
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.020]   Because in a dense, meaty passage like this,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.340]   I have to pause a lot.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.380]   And I don't get any of my questions answered
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.620]   when I'm just going through this, okay?
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.280]   And I get to verse seven, being justified by his grace.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.100]   First thing I notice in the Greek is it's diakothentes,
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.520]   which is the same root as righteousness.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.280]   There's a legal declaration.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.780]   You guys know Romans three 23?
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.900]   For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.280]   For all have sinned, fall short of the glory of God,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.420]   and are justified freely by his grace.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.740]   That's verse 24.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.060]   So there's a legal term, okay?
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.200]   And I notice in the Greek that it's in the eris,
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.620]   which means it's a completed action.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.840]   So it's a one-time act.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.780]   I don't need to be justified again tomorrow.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.360]   It's done, it's in the past.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.820]   So if I'm not quite sure what justification means,
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.580]   and then I'll consult my Grudem theology book,
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.500]   and here's a definition.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.300]   An instantaneous legal act of God
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.940]   in which he thinks of our sins as forgiven
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.980]   and Christ's righteousness as belonging to us
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.180]   and declares us to be righteous in his sight.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.540]   How cool is that?
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.980]   I've offended holy, holy, holy, holy God.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.100]   I deserve to be wiped out, obliterated,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.180]   and experience his full wrath for eternity,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.580]   but he declares me innocent.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.660]   Okay, so then I see this word grace, and I have to pause.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.860]   Okay, I've seen the word grace so much in my life
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.180]   that I'm thinking of just like passing by it,
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.780]   but I'm gonna sit down and just kind of chart through,
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.860]   now how is this significant?
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.120]   It's unmerited favor.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.860]   Not one single human being can boast
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.660]   that he earned even a fraction of his or her salvation.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:58.580]   I was declared innocent, not by anything I did,
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.260]   but because he just chose to respond
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.500]   to my plea of faith, help me,
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.200]   and he deemed me innocent.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.300]   So there's a lot in here, okay?
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   And there are books upon books
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.320]   and upon books written for every single point,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.140]   not just if you already knew that.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.100]   Yeah, so there's no way I'm gonna wrap this up
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.540]   in 25 minutes going through all of this, okay?
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.540]   So all of my homework in these 16 pages was done at home
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:38.700]   before I consulted a commentary, okay?
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.060]   But I have to teach,
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.780]   so I actually have to consult the commentary.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.500]   So I'm plowing through all of this,
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.300]   and that takes all of my Monday, my day off.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.180]   I'm like plowing through all of this, put it together.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.860]   Wednesday, I'm scrambling until the end
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.440]   to make these slides, but I get to verse seven.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.020]   So that being justified by his grace,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.620]   we would be made heirs.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.020]   And then because I've memorized all of Titus
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.400]   a few months ago, my mind goes back to the similar language.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.880]   Chapter one, verse two, chapter two, verse 13.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.140]   There's a similar language.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.900]   In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.800]   promised long ages ago.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.840]   Verse 13, which we covered two weeks ago,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.560]   looking for the blessed hope and the appearing
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.160]   So there's a future focus.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.780]   Right?
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.960]   And my mind goes to Romans 8, 15 to 17.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.120]   For you have not received the spirit of slavery
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.000]   leading to fear again, but you have received
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.080]   the spirit of adoption as sons,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.480]   by which we cry out, Abba, Father.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.680]   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.040]   that we are children of God.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.680]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.820]   and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him,
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.560]   so that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.080]   So I've just done all this homework
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.640]   from verses four through seven,
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.920]   this one sentence in Greek, trying to chart through
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.100]   all of the significant stuff, and there are pages of it.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.560]   But I land on this, I would be made an heir part.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.720]   Okay?
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.600]   And my mind goes to, you know that song?
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.400]   Like, no eye has seen, no ear has heard,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.080]   no mind has ever conceived the glorious things
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.000]   that he has prepared for us who've believed.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.120]   Right?
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.160]   So I think of that song, like,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.960]   how high and how wide, how deep and how,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.720]   you guys know that song, right?
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.320]   And then I'm like, ah, where was that verse?
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.640]   So I go to Google, I go, no eye has seen, no ear has heard.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.220]   And then I go, hey, hey, 1 Corinthians 2.9.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.360]   You should do that, if you're like,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.760]   oh, this verse sounds like this, use your Google.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.680]   Okay, we have so many tools.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.720]   And then I'm reminded of this, right?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.320]   Things which eye has not seen,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.240]   and ear has not heard,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.800]   and which have not even entered the heart of man,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.260]   all that God has prepared for those who love him.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.520]   Think about this, all right?
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.160]   My eyes have seen some beautiful things in this life.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   People make visual movies that blow my mind, right?
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.360]   Now we're numb, 'cause we've seen so many of it, right?
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.680]   When "The Matrix" first came out, it's ooh, right?
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.480]   Our friends, we were like, wow, what a cool movie.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.840]   And I heard "Star Wars" was like that
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.160]   for the previous generation, right?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.760]   It's like, whoa.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.360]   But now we're numb, okay?
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.920]   One of my favorite things to do is to go to an aquarium
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.440]   and just sit there and look at the fish.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.280]   Do you know why?
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.560]   It's like a masterpiece of art under the water.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.760]   I can't see this from the surface.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.360]   If I'm driving on the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.960]   and I look at the water, it's just brown or blue,
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.360]   depending on the sunlight.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.160]   But if I go snorkeling or if I go to an aquarium,
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.620]   I'm like, God is so creative.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.320]   There's fish that are so colorful.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.660]   There are fish that are so ugly.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.240]   There are fish that have a little light bulb
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.160]   in the front of it.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.440]   I'm like, what is that?
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.760]   And I can imagine the wonderful things
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.320]   that God has made on this earth
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.600]   that man has not discovered yet.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.400]   There are spiders that people are still discovering.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.320]   And these are all things that people can imagine
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.040]   and conceive of mentally.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.840]   And for those who are artistic, they can draw it out.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.960]   Like, lately, my wife and I, not lately,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.560]   but the other day we watched a documentary on Blackpink.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.640]   You guys know what Blackpink is?
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.200]   I never knew Blackpink.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.140]   My wife never knew Blackpink, but we're like,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.860]   dude, young people today, they all into Blackpink.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.480]   So there's a Netflix documentary on Blackpink.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.300]   Let's watch it.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.140]   So we watched it.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.700]   But I was like, one of the girls' voices,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.320]   I don't even remember her name, I was like,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.000]   she has a nice voice.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.400]   At my funeral, I would love if she could sing there.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.000]   Right, I mean, I'm like, wow.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.080]   What a beautiful sound that she makes.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.160]   And don't ask me who it is,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.040]   'cause I don't even know.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.120]   But it was like, wow, she has a good voice.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.280]   But can you imagine, like, when we get to heaven,
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.620]   because we are a child of God, because we are in air,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.840]   there are things that are unimaginable, unfathomable,
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.360]   not conceivable, that God has prepared to amaze us
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   every day for eternity.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.320]   Again, and again, and again, where every day we're amazed
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.720]   and gawking and in awe at all the wonderful things
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.800]   that we're seeing, and we have no sin.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.400]   And when you have no sin, you don't get tired of stuff.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.920]   One of the greatest strategies of the fall
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.800]   is we get tired of stuff.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.080]   You go to the Grand Canyon the first time, whoa.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.880]   You go the second time, you go, wow, ooh,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.040]   look at them saying wow.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.840]   The third time, you don't even look at the Grand Canyon,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.680]   you look at other people's reaction.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.600]   That's how we are, right?
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   The first time I ate really good food,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.520]   I was like, wow, it's a party in your mouth.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.360]   And then you go there again, and again, and again,
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.080]   and again, then it just becomes food.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.500]   That's sin.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.740]   But when we are seeing God face to face, sin free,
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.360]   when we're seeing all of his creation, sin free.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.380]   This is not something that you have even imagined yet,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.440]   the things that he has prepared for us.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:36.140]   And all of this is awaiting for us.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.560]   Why?
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.360]   Not because we earned it, but because we believed.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   We committed cosmic treason, as some like to say.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:53.140]   But we didn't just get away with it.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:59.840]   We got adopted and received all the blessings
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.480]   as someone who's lived in perfect obedience all of his life,
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.040]   all because of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.520]   And because of that, I have a heavenly father,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.240]   creator of the universe, as my father,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.800]   who loves me a lot more fiercely than I love my children.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:24.440]   There's a lot of work in verses four through seven.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.580]   But when I got to verse seven in the part of heirs,
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.520]   it hit me.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.000]   'Cause I have a very lively imagination.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.520]   Just thinking, the Bible says I can't imagine
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.000]   what God has prepared, but I'm gonna try to imagine it.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.840]   Right?
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.260]   Glorious things.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.000]   And I can start this relationship already.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.240]   I've already started it.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.620]   I'm getting to know him.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.640]   I'm seeing how beautiful he is.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.840]   I'm seeing how trustworthy he is.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.160]   And I'm like, why me?
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.560]   I don't worry about everybody else.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.520]   I'm like, thank God that he didn't just
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.160]   not choose to punish me.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.120]   He adopted me as his child.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.560]   Man.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.080]   I've met a lot of orphans in the world.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.440]   And when I see Maddie and Karis,
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   a lot of times I'm thinking, they're so fortunate
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.040]   to have Becky as their mom.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.220]   Me, I don't give myself that much credit.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.120]   My wife is a very good mom.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.280]   They are so fortunate.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.960]   And when they say weird stuff, I actually get pretty upset.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.680]   So Becky and I are like, we're like,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.920]   I'm like, hey, you don't say that to your mom.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.120]   I'm pretty stern about that stuff.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.840]   They called my egg trash the other day.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.680]   I was like, your egg tastes like trash.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.560]   Like that, I was a little offended.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.480]   But if they said that to Becky's egg, I would get upset.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.880]   'Cause I'm like, you don't understand how glorious
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.400]   a thing it is to be a child of her.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.000]   And I think we live a lot of times learning all this stuff
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.640]   without fully enjoying the benefits of it.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.560]   Right?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.720]   So then what's the relationship between our salvation
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   and our good deeds?
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:17.560]   Churches like Berean, people from outside looking in,
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.160]   every now and then you get that whole,
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   oh, they're legalistic.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.540]   But you know what legalism is?
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.160]   You're trying to earn your way to salvation by doing good.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.720]   No, so that's outside looking in.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.520]   What it is is we are trying to just say thank you
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.200]   by our life.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.320]   And we're trying to live such a nice, good life
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.880]   so that others will be attracted to this light.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.120]   We wanna be so different from the world
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.320]   so that when the world is disgusted with themselves,
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.600]   they can see the joy that we have, the love that we have,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.840]   the compassion that we have,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.680]   and just kinda wanna come to it.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.040]   That's why we do good deeds.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.980]   Not to earn any extra favor from God, but why?
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.400]   To say thank you.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:14.020]   As a worship, as living sacrifices, we wanna say thank you.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.260]   So what's the relationship between all this doctrine
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.780]   that we just breezed through today and our good deeds?
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.980]   And good deeds are all over Titus.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.180]   1 16, 2 7, 2 14, 3 1, 3 8, 3 14.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.340]   It's emphasized again and again in each chapter.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.740]   So I'm just gonna take you to another Paul's epistle.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.580]   All right?
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.780]   This is one that you've memorized as a child.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.500]   For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.740]   and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.780]   Not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.520]   Right?
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.660]   You guys know this verse.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.100]   ♪ Ephesians 2, 8, 9 ♪
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.940]   Right?
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.760]   You guys know this one.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.900]   People memorize this and people quote this.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.620]   It's like, we've been saved by grace.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.920]   Yes.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.620]   But you know what verse 10 says?
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.060]   Who knows what verse 10 says?
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.380]   (footsteps)
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.420]   For we are his workmanship,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.620]   created in Christ Jesus for what?
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.260]   Good works, which God prepared when?
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.980]   Way beforehand, so that we will walk in them.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:24.220]   So our obedience is our way of saying we love you,
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.980]   we trust you, we want you to get all the glory.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.660]   Thank you, God, that you took a bunch of mosquitoes
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.660]   and didn't just obliterate us.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.380]   Didn't just grab all of us and just let us out of hell.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:44.580]   But that you took a bunch of us and called us children.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.960]   What a weird God.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.700]   It's not amazing grace.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.460]   It's dumbfounding, silly, absurd grace.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.460]   How sweet the sound.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.360]   And that's why we're heirs.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.540]   So if the study of all of this was a drag,
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.780]   I mean, it wasn't easy.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.340]   That means you're forgetting,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.020]   like, you're kinda, it's like you're reading a biography
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.140]   as an outsider looking in.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.420]   But when you think through, man, this was done to me,
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.700]   that causes you to worship.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.720]   That causes you to stop complaining.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.540]   And that starts to work in you
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.060]   to provoke an attitude of just joy
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.460]   and thanksgiving and peace,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.060]   no matter what the circumstance.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.520]   Right?
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.460]   'Cause to die is to what?
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.860]   Christ in me is to live, but to die is?
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.700]   Gang.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:47.720]   When we can finally meet and encounter
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.160]   the stuff that we could never have imagined anyway
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.620]   of how good and how beautiful.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.660]   No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.560]   no mind has conceived.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.840]   Of the glorious thing that the Lord has prepared
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.000]   for those who love him.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.880]   This passage should really, like,
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.940]   freak you out by how glorious it is.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.400]   And it's dense.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.280]   So my encouragement would be just go through it
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.200]   line by line again whenever you have time
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.580]   and just worship through the course of the week
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.980]   at each of these points.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.400]   Thank you, Lord, for leading me to repentance.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.140]   It's your kindness.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.300]   Thank you, Father, for renewing me.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.820]   And the process of even renewing my mind
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.720]   is the same word, right?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.240]   Not being conformed to the pattern of this world,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.320]   but to be transformed by the renewing of my mind.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.520]   What else of my mind do I need renewed?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.600]   Lord, I submit.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.480]   And again, thank you for making me a child.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.380]   And I'm sorry I call some of the things you give me trash.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.800]   It should cause us an emotional response
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.680]   because you're reading stuff about your life story
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.800]   and how you went from hell-bound to saint,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.460]   all because of Christ and his work on the cross.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.940]   Amen?
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.080]   So you're only gonna have one thing to share with a partner.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.260]   Describe how you repented in response
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.000]   to the kindness of God, how you came to be justified,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.940]   and how you've since been living
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.280]   as an adopted heir of God.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.240]   I could have put this easily as, share your testimony.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.120]   I didn't wanna do that.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   'Cause this one's gonna actually have to cause you
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.160]   to theologically think through your testimony, right?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.760]   Did you never repent?
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.520]   That's actually a very important question.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.140]   Have you repented of your depravity?
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.600]   Okay, how did you come to that point of justification?
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.700]   And how have you been living
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.640]   since you've been adopted as an heir of God?
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.720]   Okay, so this is a very packed, weighty question.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.360]   And however you wanna share it with a partner in your group,
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.760]   by all means do so.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.600]   All right?
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.520]   Just as a quick reminder, next week, no Bible study.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.400]   'Cause I think next week's Thanksgiving week.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.800]   And then the following week, we're almost done.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.400]   We have two left, and then we're done with Titus.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.160]   Okay, Titus 3, 9 to 11, is the following section.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.600]   It's only three verses.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.680]   A lot less meaty, okay?
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.460]   So the rest of your time, just do number one,
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.860]   and then you can dismiss in your group.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   (people chattering)
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   (people chattering)
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   (people chattering)
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   (people chattering)
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   (people chattering)
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.860]   (people chattering)
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
