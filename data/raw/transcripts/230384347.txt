[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I'm going to jump into the text this morning in Romans chapter 11.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'm not going to read the text.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.480]   Elder Joe already read it, and I'm going to just jump right in, just continue the theme
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.200]   of God's faithfulness.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400]   So let me pray first, and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.720]   Gracious Father, what an awesome God you are.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   We want, as you've been faithful all these years, and at times as we labor, sometimes
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.160]   there's frustration of wanting to see fruit in a certain way, but we know, Father, you're
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.360]   sovereign that in your time and in your purpose, Lord God, that you will fulfill what you have
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.360]   desired.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.160]   I pray that as we've been reminded, Lord, of your grace over Rita's life, that you would
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   continue to help us to be faithful, to fix our eyes on Christ's eternity and all the
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   promises.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.080]   So I pray that your word would speak to us to remind us that again.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.040]   You know, the question that Paul has asked previously, and he's been trying to answer,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.800]   not just in the last few chapters, but probably from the very beginning of the book of Romans,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.480]   is what about the Jews?
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.160]   And this is a huge question in the church today, that the church in some sense is divided
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.700]   because depending on what commentary you open up or what church you go to, they will say
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.080]   that Israel is done, that God had his time with the nation of Israel and now Israel and
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.640]   church has become one.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.920]   And so whenever the scripture talks about his people, he's talking about the church,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.360]   the Gentile and the Jews alike.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.720]   I believe, again, and my conviction has grown only stronger in the years, that when God
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.840]   was working with the nation of Israel, he wasn't just temporarily saying that until
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.960]   Christ comes and the Gentile church comes into existence, that he's going to be faithful
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   to them.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   And once that happens, he's going to mesh them all together and we're just all going
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.240]   to become one.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.440]   That sounds good, but it's inconsistent with what I see in scripture.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.480]   And I'm going to be talking briefly about the subject of the church in Israel.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.840]   Again, I'm not going to go too deep into it, but about God's faithfulness, his love to
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.960]   the church.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   And we may sit here and think, that's one of those topics that only seminary students
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.280]   or pastors or theologians are interested, but for the average person, that's not a subject
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280]   that's that important.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   At least that's what we would tend to think.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.200]   But I want to start off by telling you just how important this is.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.440]   And the main point or the application of God's love for Israel, I'm going to share that at
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   the very end.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.000]   So even though you might be sitting, I'm already addressing the issue of maybe some of you
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.640]   guys sitting here is like, "Oh, he's going to talk about Israel."
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.000]   But again, I hope that you stay with me to get to the conclusion and the application
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   of that.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920]   Obviously, Paul has said already, but he's repeating again, if everything that you have
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.840]   said about the gospel is true, that it is by faith and by grace alone and not by observing
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.000]   the laws, then is God done with Israel?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.640]   If they've hardened their hearts against God and they sin over and over again, is God done?
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.560]   And his answer to that is, "By no means."
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.640]   By no means is it done.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.480]   And then the answer he gives is, "I'm a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin."
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.120]   In other words, he said, "I have personal vested interest in this."
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.200]   That this is not just some random subject.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.960]   You're talking about me.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.320]   You're talking about my people.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.160]   He says, "By no means."
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560]   I could spend probably weeks talking about why I believe that Israel is still in the
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   heart of God.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.080]   And when I say Israel, we're talking about Israel as his people, as a nation.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.040]   Now we don't have time to go into the details and intricacies of how that will play out,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.600]   when it will play out, but why I believe this subject is so important.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   One, the previous passage, he said that the gospel was opened up, the kingdom was opened
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.160]   up to the Gentiles for what purpose?
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.760]   To stir up what?
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.840]   Do you remember?
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   To make them jealous.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.120]   To get them jealous.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.040]   I don't know about you, but I don't know anybody who breaks off from a previous relationship
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.880]   that he's completely done with and is doing things to make that person jealous.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   The only reason why you're trying to do things to make that other person jealous is hoping
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.520]   that you get back together with them.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.200]   Nobody who's moved on is going to do anything to make them jealous, because if they're jealous,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.160]   they're going to hinder what you're doing with this new person.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.600]   The only reason why God is doing this to make them jealous is because God is not done with
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Israel.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.000]   It would only make sense that God is trying to stir up the nation of Israel.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.960]   So at one point, say, that same God who loves the Gentiles, he also loved us, but look at
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.640]   the blessing upon them so that Israel will be brought back into the fold.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.520]   Not only that, the whole time in Jesus' ministry, the disciples were asking, is it now?
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   Are you going to now bring the kingdom?
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.240]   At the kingdom, can you let me sit to the left or to the right?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.520]   At the kingdom, who is the greatest?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.420]   They didn't fully understand, but after his death and resurrection, before he goes up
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.280]   to heaven, the disciples still couldn't let it go.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.760]   And the last question that they asked Jesus before they left in Acts chapter 1, 6, so
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.960]   when they had come together, they asked him, the disciples asking Jesus, "Lord, will you
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.120]   at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.920]   Because you and I don't live in a, you know, like a patriotic, and even though we think
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.680]   we are, but if you've ever been to a country where the nationalism, the patriotism toward
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   their country is the most important thing.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.800]   It's their religion.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.360]   You know, when I was younger, Korea was like that.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.800]   You know, when Korea had, some of you guys may or may not remember, when they had the
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.320]   World Cup, they said 80% of Korea had watched the World Cup soccer.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.280]   I grew up, when I was younger, in a country where the country came above everything.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.600]   It came above your parents, your friendship, your school, your education.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.080]   You sacrificed and died for your nation.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.640]   So living in a country like this, it's hard for us to understand the kind of nationalism
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   that the Jews had.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.080]   So that's why Paul, the very first question, he says, "Is God done with his people?"
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.720]   He said, "By no means, I'm a Jew."
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.560]   See, when the disciples were asking, they weren't just asking about this kingdom that
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   involves everybody.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.680]   They were specifically saying, "Are you done with Israel?"
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.120]   Jesus doesn't say, "Hey, you've got the kingdom wrong.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.640]   You've had your chance up to this point, so now the kingdom is going to open to everybody
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   else."
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.560]   And so we're talking, if he wanted to correct them, that would have been the perfect time
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.560]   to correct them.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.160]   "You just can't let go of Israel."
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.840]   He doesn't say that.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.000]   He answers them and says, "It is not for you to know the times or the season that the
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.280]   Father has fixed by his own authority."
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.760]   He doesn't say, "You're wrong."
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.280]   He doesn't say, "You need to have a new understanding of the kingdom."
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.520]   He says, "No, God has fixed, he has ordained a specific time when that is going to be fulfilled."
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   He doesn't say, "If."
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   He said, "When."
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.400]   "When is this going to happen?"
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   "You just don't know that, but it's going to happen."
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.920]   In Revelation chapter 5, even at the very end when we see the vision of heaven, we see
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.760]   a vision of 144,000 Jews.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   Now we don't know if that's an actual number of 144,000, but there is a distinction between
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.040]   the nation of Israel and then behind them standing the Gentiles who are worshiping behind
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040]   them.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.920]   So there is a clear distinction between Israel and the rest of the church.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   Now why is this so important?
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.400]   Again, I'm going to get to that at the very end.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.880]   But let me give you a hint of why this is so important.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.020]   Because it reveals to us our God's nature of who he is.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.200]   The answer he gives in chapter 11, verse 1 and 2 is very simple.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   Is God done with Israel?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.600]   He said, "By no means, for I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.120]   of the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew."
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.680]   The simple answer to that question is he didn't reject Israel because he foreknew them.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.700]   Now it's important for us to understand the doctrine of foreknowledge because in it contains
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.380]   why God is not done with Israel and why we can bank on his promises.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.440]   He says, "God is not done with Israel because he foreknew them."
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.040]   Now what I want to do for the rest of the time is to dissect and understand the doctrine
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.560]   of foreknowledge.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.320]   What does God mean when he says he foreknew Israel?
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.480]   And also in return what it means to foreknow us.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.200]   One, foreknowledge means that God chose to know Israel intimately.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.460]   That God sovereignly chose to know Israel intimately.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.400]   Some people have taken the English word foreknowledge and said, "Well, God knows what they were
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.520]   going to do."
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.320]   That's not what the word means at all.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   The word for foreknowledge in Greek is pro-gnosco, that he knew beforehand.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.760]   Not knew as in he looked down history and he kind of predicted and he saw something
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   that was going to happen.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.480]   It means that he predetermined.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.480]   I'm just going to read straight from the Bible dictionary in complete word study dictionary.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.520]   This is kind of like my go-to Bible Greek dictionary.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.600]   And instead of me explaining it to you, I'm just going to read what it says about this
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   word.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.840]   "In the language of Scripture, something foreknown is not simply that which God was
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   aware of prior to a certain point.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.560]   Rather, it is presented as that which God gave prior consent to, that which received
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.160]   his favorable or special recognition.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.280]   Hence, this term is reserved for those matters which God favorably, deliberately, and freely
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.360]   chose and ordained."
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.880]   So he wasn't just looking down history and say, "Oh, that's what he's going to do."
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.000]   The doctrine of foreknowledge is God willfully, deliberately, freely choosing the nation of
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.560]   Israel.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   But to add to that, the meaning of that, the word to know in the Bible is not the way you
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.400]   and I normally use the word know.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   Like I know how to eat, I know how to drive, I know how to read.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.560]   Those of you who are at the family retreat, I think Pastor Ray did a great job talking
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.960]   about what it means to know.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.840]   The Bible used to know oftentimes to describe a relationship between husband and wife, that
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.680]   Adam and Eve knew each other and they had children.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.440]   What does that mean?
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.560]   That they didn't exchange information about each other.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.160]   It means they had physical relation, sexual relation.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.920]   They were intimate.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.680]   And because of this intimacy, they were able to have a child.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.520]   So the scripture often uses the word knowledge as intimate, personal relationship between
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.960]   a person, two people.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.440]   So to pre-know something means that God had determined prior to Israel even existing that
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   He had predetermined to focus His attention, to choose them.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:32.680]   So in Amos chapter 3 verse 2, when it says, "Israel only have I known," He's not saying
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.720]   that He didn't know anything about the Babylonians, He didn't know anything about Assyrians, He
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.920]   didn't know anything about Persians.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.960]   That's not what He's saying.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:46.320]   He said that Israel was specifically chosen to focus His attention and His love for them.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.920]   So the first understanding of foreknowledge, it was predetermined, that God pre-knew and
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.640]   focused His attention on them.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.460]   Secondly, the doctrine of foreknowledge means that God committed to make them His people.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:08.160]   He didn't just choose to know them, He chose to make them His people, to love them.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.360]   Deuteronomy chapter 7, 6 through 8, God describes the beginnings of Israel and He says, "For
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.120]   you are a people holy to the Lord your God.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.120]   The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for His treasured possession."
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.520]   Not just to own, He said, but treasured possession.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.240]   "Out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth, it was not because you were
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.800]   more in number than any other people that the Lord set His love on you and chose you.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.560]   For you were the fewest of all the peoples, but it is because the Lord loves you and is
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.920]   keeping the oath that He swore to your fathers."
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.000]   He predetermined not only to choose them, but to love them.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:00.880]   In Deuteronomy chapter 32, His love for Israel is described as the apple of God's eyes.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.080]   Apple of God's eyes, again, I think for the sake of time, the best way to describe it
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:11.780]   is He's illustrating the fact that if something is coming toward your eyes, you don't think
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.880]   as the thing is coming and say, "Should I close my eyes?"
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.960]   There's no thought process involved.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.440]   Even a lint is coming in and you immediately swipe it away.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.900]   If it's a little tiny fly, you don't think there, it's like, "You can't harm me."
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.320]   You don't sit there and say, "You know, I'm just going to wipe this out."
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.080]   You instinctively close your eyes.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.560]   You instinctively swat at it.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.980]   You do anything in your power to duck, to get it away, to protect your eyes.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.680]   You may not do that if it's coming toward your arm or anything else, but for whatever
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.240]   the reason, God had made it instinctively because of the sensitivity that if anything
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.400]   is coming toward your eye, we instinctively, without even thinking, God is using that as
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.240]   an illustration to describe the preciousness of Israel to Him.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.680]   Instinctively, if you harm Israel, you are harming the apple of my eye.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   Not only did He predetermine to choose them, He says He predetermined to love them, to
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.080]   cherish them.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.240]   Also in Psalm 105, verse 8 through 8, He says He remembers His covenant forever.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   The word that He commanded for a thousand generations, the covenant that He made with
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.120]   Abraham, He swore, His sworn promise to Isaac, which He confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.840]   to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.600]   He said He made this covenant and He said He will never break this covenant.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.160]   But yet some people will look at the prophet Isaiah and they say, "Well, I mean, there's
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   a clear evidence that He is done with Israel.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.840]   Israel kept on rebelling over and over again and as a result of that, they're going into
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.280]   captivity."
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   And so, some of you guys who studied the book of Hosea, it starts out by saying God telling
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.960]   Hosea to go marry Gomer, a prostitute, and she's going to keep prostituting herself,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.640]   but you're going to keep forgiving her and embracing her to physically illustrate the
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.960]   relationship between Israel and God.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:09.320]   To further illustrate this frustration, this rebellion, that Hosea has three children.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.720]   The first child's name is Jezreel, which means God's souls, meaning that God is about to
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.680]   reveal something very important to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   The second child they have, a daughter, her name is Loharuma.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.940]   Loharuma literally means she has not received mercy.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.560]   As a result of the rebellion, God is going to withhold His mercy.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.920]   And then third, finally, the end result of this rebellion, the third child's name is
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   Lo-Ami.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.800]   Lo-Ami literally means not my people.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.920]   Some people will read that and say, "Well, there's clear evidence that their rebellion
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   against God has caused God to withdraw."
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.560]   And He says, "You are not my people."
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.040]   But if you keep reading in the book of Hosea, you will find that even in the context of
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.160]   rebellion, even in the context of God bringing judgment upon the nation of Israel, He tells
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.680]   them He is not done with Israel.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.640]   Hosea chapter 1, 10-11, "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.680]   of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.080]   And in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' it shall be said
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.400]   to them, 'Children of the living God.'"
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.960]   This is right after He told them that because of your rebellion, you are not my people.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.040]   But He said even in that context, He says, "I am not done with you."
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.880]   In Isaiah 49, verse 15 and 16, He says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child that she
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.300]   should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.400]   Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.520]   Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.820]   Your walls are continually before me."
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:55.200]   He promises the nation of Israel over and over again that He will not forget His covenant.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.980]   It wasn't at some point, you know, even as they were rebelling against God, God says,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.840]   "Because of your rebellion, judgment is coming, but I will never forget my covenant with you."
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.680]   So first, He preordained His choice of Israel, and then He preordained His choice to love
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.580]   them and He promises to be faithful to them.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.740]   Thirdly, the doctrine of foreknowledge means that God chose to establish Israel through
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.740]   the remnants.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.020]   So the natural question is, if God is going to be that faithful to the nation of Israel,
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.820]   does that mean that they don't need to believe the gospel, that they're just going to be
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.060]   saved?
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:38.100]   And that's where He brings this example of how God preserved the nation of Israel during
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.100]   the time of Elijah.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.020]   So some of you guys may know the story.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.740]   Elijah's ministry happened during the time of King Ahab.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:53.180]   King Ahab is probably considered maybe either the worst or second worst king of Israel.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.260]   So there's a debate between, is Ahab worse or Manasseh the worst?
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   There's a, you know, it's a toss-up between the two.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.940]   They were both extremely evil.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:07.580]   Elijah, even before his encounter with the Baal priest, he's already burnt out.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.060]   His encounter in chapter 18 begins by saying, "There's no other prophet left.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.460]   Everybody is worshiping God."
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.740]   And God speaks to him and says, "Go tell Ahab.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.620]   Go tell Ahab that there's going to be an encounter."
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:21.380]   So Elijah goes down and challenges Ahab.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.260]   And he gathers the whole nation of Israel.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:31.300]   He wants to make this very public in hopes that after this encounter of demonstrating
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.340]   God's power, that revival is going to break out in Israel.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.500]   So he makes a deal.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:43.220]   You gather 450 Baal priests, and then I will stand by myself, and we're going to put up
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.580]   an altar, and let's see whose God is real.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.620]   And then he turns to the nation of Israel, and he says to them, "It is enough for you
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.380]   to be teeter-tottering between these two.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.340]   If Baal is God, make up your mind and worship Baal.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:05.180]   But if Yahweh is God, then make up your mind and commit and repent and worship him."
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:10.660]   So the whole reason of this encounter was in hopes that when God showed up, that there
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.700]   would be a revival that breaks out.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.340]   If you know the story, he says, "You know what?
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.060]   There's 450 of you.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.340]   Why don't you start?"
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.940]   So he gets a bull.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.500]   He sacrifices it and puts it up on the altar.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   And he says, "Go ahead.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.480]   You know, all 450 of you, start praying to Baal.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.700]   See what happens."
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.980]   So all morning, they're chanting, and they're crying out, and they're asking Baal to come
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.340]   and consume this worship.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.340]   Nothing happens.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.220]   And something comical, and this is Elijah, the first sarcastic prophet that we know in
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.220]   the Bible.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.780]   And he basically says, "Is your God sleeping?
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.240]   Maybe he's relieving himself.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   Maybe he's tired."
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   You know?
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]   And he's mocking them.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.800]   There's one guy with 450, and he's like, "Maybe he's tired.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   Keep going.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Keep going."
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.900]   So they keep going all day long, and nothing happens.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.900]   Right?
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   So maybe he's tired.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.640]   And then he moves him aside, and I'll show you.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.200]   And he begins to pray to God.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.600]   But before he does that, he wants to make sure that everybody knows that something supernatural
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.700]   is going to happen.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.820]   So he takes three buckets of water, and he pours it on.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820]   Make sure that it's so wet.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   I mean, this can't catch on fire.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   And he says, "That's not enough.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.120]   Bring another three buckets."
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   He pours it on.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.760]   He does it three times.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.980]   He puts so much water over this sacrifice that the water is flowing over this altar.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.600]   And he said, "Now we're ready."
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.960]   So he prays to God.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   Fire comes down.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   Consumes everything.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.000]   And as a result of that, he says, "Now.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.040]   Now you know who's God."
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   And so he fully expects revival to break out.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   The bald priest are destroyed.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   Ahab is going to repent, overthrow.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.920]   Instead, after this is all done, Jezebel, the wife who was silent throughout this whole
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.160]   process, you know, who was the wife of Ahab, appears.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.520]   Now, you know, you probably heard, at least jokingly, people say that the husband is the
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.400]   head and the wife is the neck, you know, because the neck controls the head.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   Completely unbiblical.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.200]   But you probably heard that before.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.960]   In this case, it was absolutely true.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.600]   Jezebel was the neck.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.080]   Ahab, though he was the king, was completely controlled by Jezebel.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.560]   You know, there's a reason why people don't name their daughters Jezebel, because she's
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.640]   not a good figure.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.120]   Like boys aren't named Judas and girls are not named Jezebel.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.560]   There's for a reason.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.720]   She's not a good character.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.880]   She shows up on the scene, and Ahab is scared to death because of what happened.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.640]   Jezebel comes on the scene, is like, "You fool.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.840]   You're going to let that one weird prophet destroy everything that we built?"
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.760]   And so she makes an edict, "Get that guy and kill him."
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.680]   Strangely, you would think after experiencing this kind of power, and Elijah is known in
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.440]   Israel's history to be the most powerful prophet.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.120]   He performed the most miracles, the greatest and most powerful miracles, and because of
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.800]   her threat, because of her threat, he runs out into the desert and he's hiding in the
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   cave.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   It's a weird scene.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.400]   Like, why?
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.520]   You just won the MMA championship and it was the greatest fight of your life.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:25.080]   You destroyed everybody, and all of a sudden, the guy you destroyed, his wife says, "Get
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   that guy."
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.560]   And he's just, "Oh," and then he just starts running.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.840]   That's basically what happens in 1 Kings chapter 18.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.320]   He's hiding in the cave.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.360]   God shows up and God simply says, "What are you doing here?"
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   Right?
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.440]   And he asked him several times, "Elijah, what are you doing here?"
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.720]   So that whole scene is weird.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.160]   Like why is he scared?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.600]   Why is he there?
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.320]   But if you look carefully, you'll find exactly why.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.880]   He wasn't necessarily scared of Jezebel.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.800]   He was frustrated with Israel.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.040]   He comes and he says in 1 Kings 19.10, he says to God, "I have been very jealous for
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.480]   the Lord, the God of hosts.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.440]   For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.160]   your prophets with the sword.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.840]   And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life to take it away."
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.000]   In other words, he thought revival was going to break out, but it didn't.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.840]   He thought people are going to be on their knees repenting and claiming love for Yahweh,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.240]   but it didn't.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.480]   Instead, they were more hardened.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.280]   And Jezebel saying, "Let's get this guy."
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.880]   He's like, "Oh my gosh, after all of that?"
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.600]   He lost all hope in Israel.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.080]   And I'm sure he was probably thinking the same thing.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.760]   "Are you done?
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.760]   Is this it?
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.000]   If they won't repent after this, what hope do we have?"
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.160]   That's why he was in the cave, because he felt like he had nobody.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.080]   Obviously, you know the story, God shows up, not in the earthquake, not in the fire, but
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.880]   in the gentle wind.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.600]   God reminds him, "It's not because of your power.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.160]   It's not because of your effort."
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.200]   He said, "I have 7,000 men who have not bowed to Baal.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.640]   Now get back up and do your ministry."
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.280]   And God sends him on his way.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.000]   That it wasn't your effort, it wasn't your cleverness, it wasn't this powerful encounter,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   simply because God made a promise to Israel that, "I'm going to keep my covenant."
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   In Isaiah 10.20, "In that day, the remnant of Israel, of the survivors of the house of
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.440]   Jacob, will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the Lord, the Holy
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.000]   One of Israel, in truth."
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.360]   Again in Isaiah 37.31.32, "And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   take root downward and bear fruit upward, for out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.560]   out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.960]   The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this."
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.040]   Now why is this so important?
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.960]   Why am I speaking about this so passionately?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.180]   "Oh God is faithful to Israel, God's not done with Israel."
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.840]   Because God's faithfulness to Israel is his resume.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.480]   There's a reason why your credit score matters.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.200]   Why before they give you a loan, they look at your credit score, and if you, you could
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.840]   have been faithful and you paid off your loan 9 out of 10 times, but that one time that
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.120]   you didn't pay off your loan, there's a possibility that you might, even if it's 10%, even if
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.280]   it's 5%, if I loan you the money, there's a good chance that you might not pay it back
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   because you have a history of unfaithfulness.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.900]   There's a reason why when you go get a job, they ask you to get references.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.400]   And they want to check your different references.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.480]   Or you may show up and say, "Oh, that was like that in the past.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.360]   You know, I'm sure I'm not going to be like that today.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   I'm not going to rip you off.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.000]   I'm going to be a faithful worker."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.520]   But they say, "Well, your past doesn't show that."
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.440]   There's a reason why these things are important because in order to entrust something to you,
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.920]   that there has to be a track record that you're not going to, you're going to be faithful
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.320]   with what I entrust to you.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   See, God's love for the nation of Israel is his resume.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:29.080]   For 2,000 plus years, he made a promise to the nation of Israel, and he stuck with it
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.400]   thick and thin.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:41.320]   In their rebellion, in their idolatry, in their complacency, even as they're going into
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:49.560]   captivity, even after prostituting themselves over and over again, even after beating, even
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.160]   after killing his own prophets.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.040]   And then if that wasn't enough, he sends his only begotten son, and they don't recognize
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.080]   him either.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.360]   They beat him, they crucify him.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.840]   And you would think that that was a final straw.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:16.160]   That I've been patient with all of this stuff, and you even beat my son?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.520]   You crucify my son?
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   And you would think that that would be it.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:27.180]   So when Paul asked that question, now, will you reject his people now?
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:33.360]   Even now, I can understand why you would have rejected Israel a long time ago.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.240]   It isn't simply no.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.280]   It isn't simply it's not done.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.520]   He says by no means.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.280]   By no means.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.960]   God will remain faithful to his covenant because that's who he is.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.520]   In Hebrews 6, 18, it says, "So that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.920]   for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.760]   to the hope set before us."
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.400]   He cannot change his mind.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.280]   He cannot change his covenant, and he cannot lie.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.960]   So therefore, we have encouragement, strong encouragement, to hold fast to everything
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.600]   that he has promised.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.400]   If he said to the nation of Israel, "I will be faithful to you," and then says, "You
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   know what?
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   I didn't really mean Israel.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.760]   When I said Israel, I didn't mean Israel.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:30.040]   I meant kind of like Israel," then how can we be confident when we get to the end?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.500]   He said, "Well, when I say saved, I didn't really mean saved.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.440]   When I said heaven, I didn't really mean heaven.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.480]   When I said love, I didn't really mean love."
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.880]   If fundamentally, he made all of this covenant and all the things that he said in the Old
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.040]   Testament, all of it is nullified.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.600]   He said, "You know, I only held on to you to serve a purpose, and you served a purpose,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.160]   but now I'm done."
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.760]   That is not what God is doing.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.200]   That is not what we see in Scripture.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.760]   He made a covenant with the nation of Israel, and he is faithful.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:10.240]   And all the books of the Old Testament is a history of God keeping his covenant.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.400]   What he says, he does.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.240]   God is not man, neither shall I, nor the Son of Man, that he should repent.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.920]   Has he not said it, and will he not do it?
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.680]   That's who he is.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   And because he is faithful to his covenant, he is faithful to his covenant with us.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.440]   That what he says, we can bank on.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.920]   The only reason why you and I are here today as a church is because Jesus said, "I will
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.400]   build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.120]   Despite our sins, despite our rebellion, despite the divisions, despite our weakness, despite
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.800]   our everything that we've done, we're still here today because God foreordained to love
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   us like he foreordained to love the nation of Israel.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.360]   Amen?
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.280]   This is why this doctrine is so important, because the study of the nation of Israel
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.840]   is his resume that guarantees that everything that God has promised for us, that we can
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.760]   bank on, that we can invest today and forsake everything, because God said, "Heaven is
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.880]   coming."
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.360]   That no matter how difficult this life gets, no matter how many times we fail, he said,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.240]   "If you ask for forgiveness, he will forgive you of your sins."
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   And you can bank on that, just like Israel has banked on the promises that God made to
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.800]   the nation of Israel.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.200]   It's that important.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   Don't you want to follow this God?
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.160]   Don't you want to worship this God?
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.240]   Don't you want to surrender to this God?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.880]   To know that the promises of every word, jot and tittle, will not pass away until it is
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.560]   fulfilled.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.120]   Would you take a minute to pray with me?
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.080]   Again, as we ask the worship team to come back up.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   Maybe because of life circumstances and difficulty, maybe because of your own failure, sometimes
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.760]   you doubt God's promises.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.040]   Look at Israel.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.360]   Look at Israel.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:28.120]   When you look at the faithfulness of Israel, you know God will be faithful to you.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.600]   Let's take some time as we come before the Lord and as our worship team leads us, be
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.000]   reminded again why you and I are here today.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.480]   Because God's been faithful to his covenant.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.520]   He's been faithful to his promise.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.360]   Let's pray.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:48.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
