[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   This church, the EM, it became an independent church.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   We're going to go over the history in a later part of this, our program.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.680]   But they called me and said, "We need somebody to come and fill in because the guy who started
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.520]   this left and we don't have a leader."
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.960]   And only reason why I said okay was because, again, I was so burnt out.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   I felt like I couldn't, if I went to any other church, I wouldn't be able to give myself.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.120]   So I really came back to church, one, to assist and second, to see if my heart would be restored
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880]   back into ministry.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.480]   And that's how this church, again, in a nutshell, got started.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.560]   I came back thinking, like, can I go back into ministry because I could go through the
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.200]   motion but I don't know if my heart will ever be here again.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.180]   And to my own surprise, it didn't happen immediately, but as years went by, months, and I started
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.960]   to get to know the new people and then the younger people at that time who were in high
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.360]   school and maybe early college.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.560]   And I started to, to my own surprise, started growing affection for them, that I genuinely
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.240]   started caring for them.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.240]   And I could honestly say that I began to love them.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.760]   And those were the hardest period of our church ministry for the first five years because
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.360]   I had my first child and then second one and then the third came.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   Financially we were struggling.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.740]   We were a small church.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.320]   The core group of our church was very, very young.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.440]   But the only thing that kept me at the church is because God restored my heart, not necessarily
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.960]   for ministry.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.800]   It wasn't a heart for, like, I have this vision for bringing community to church, that we're
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.280]   going to plant churches and bring people to Christ.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.640]   It was just God gave me this love for the young, young people who are at our church
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.920]   and I wanted to be the best that I could be for them.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.360]   And so I didn't have a vision.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.720]   If you ask me, you know, what is your vision of the church?
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.000]   I had no vision.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.480]   It was just I wanted to make sure that they were growing and they were maturing and that
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.640]   was it and see what that led.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.680]   And again, to make a long story short, that's how I was restored back into ministry.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520]   I really considered walking away because I didn't think I could give my heart to a new
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.200]   group of people and God allowed me to have that heart and God's my witness to this day
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   that to me, bring community to church is not this organization or what are we going to
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   accomplish with this group and all of these things are necessary in a group.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.160]   But to me, this is my family.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.440]   You are my family.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.360]   I'm your uncle.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.280]   I'm your older brother.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   I'm your brother.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   I'm whatever.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.780]   Like, I'm, we're, to me, your family.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.880]   And so God has placed us together and trying to be faithful with the family that God has
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.280]   given us, whether we are 30 or 400 or 500.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.120]   So I thank God, you know.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.400]   Like I think, you ask anybody who was here 15, 20 years ago that 20 years later that
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.200]   we would be in this church celebrating 20th year anniversary with a church of 500, we
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.360]   would have just laughed in your face.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   You know, like we have one visitor per year and that we would have a joke that that would
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   be a revival.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.320]   I really, that's how we used to joke early on in church.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.400]   So to be here, to be able to celebrate with all of you, it is surreal and very thankful.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.880]   I'm going to allow you to watch the video.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.320]   The video is going to summarize some of the different aspects of our church.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   And then I'll come back here and I'm going to read off our church history minute by minute
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   and then I'll introduce our speaker for tonight.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.920]   Okay?
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:49.640]   [Music] [Applause]
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:04:00.840]   [Music] [Applause]
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:12.520]   [Music] [Applause]
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:33.800]   [Music] [Applause]
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:43.400]   The church at its inception, it was started before April 1997 by the former EM pastor
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.360]   that was at Irvine Baptist before I showed up.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   And so I left to join another church for about a year.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.960]   And then the church that I was at ended up splitting.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.200]   So I was in between churches and then found out that the pastor who launched this church
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.080]   ended up leaving after three months.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.880]   So I didn't physically join the church launch until August of 1997.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   I grew up at the church called First Korean Baptist Church of Irvine.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:22.840]   And at that time, when I was basically in college is when there were some issues with
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.720]   the adult congregation.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.400]   The pastors at that time wanted to build a second generation church and they had the
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.280]   support of the Korean congregation pastors and leaders, various leaders.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.600]   So that's really how the church got started.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.960]   And at that time, Pastor Peter had not even joined the church yet.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.000]   There was a vacuum of leadership and then these guys that I was working with when I
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.160]   was their youth pastor and then their college pastor.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.200]   So they found out that I was in between church and they called me and asked me to come and
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.760]   fill in because there's nobody there.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.480]   Only reason why I came was to kind of be an interim to help out because these are guys
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.760]   that I knew that I discipled when they were younger.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.040]   And then once I came, the Korean church had a vision of they wanted to be charismatic.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.400]   They want us to be more Korean speaking.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.960]   And so when I told them that we couldn't do that, they asked us to leave.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.920]   We had nowhere to go and we had no money.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.360]   So Tustin Baptist Church asked us or allowed us to stay in and use one of their facilities,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   their rooms.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.000]   So that was the first, let's say, total of me about first four or five years of the church.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.840]   And so there was never a time when we said, "Hey, let's launch this church and we're going
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.560]   to have this kind of church with this kind of vision."
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.880]   It was just a bunch of young guys that if we left, they would have fallen apart.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.800]   So it was more of kind of like I felt responsible for the younger guys who were there.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.320]   And then it ended up turning into a church because we ended up coming out and having
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   worship by ourselves.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.360]   You know, at the beginning of the church was very small and young.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.720]   You know, even our Bible studies, they were done at UCI and it was probably like 10 people.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.320]   Pastor Peters always reminds me that I was wearing a yellow dress when I came to the
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.880]   first service.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.960]   And I insisted I did not own a yellow dress, but apparently later I did find it.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   So the fact that he could remember what I was wearing indicates that it was a pretty
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.480]   small church to give the picture of how small it was.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.440]   I recall when they announced that they were going to start praise, literally half the
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.320]   people in the congregation left their seats to do the praise set.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.480]   And that was really funny because the church was very small and everyone who was on praise
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.400]   was in the congregation.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   And it was just a weird thing to see.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   Financially, I wasn't able to take care of my family.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   And then the church was too young.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.120]   So our offering barely paid rent.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.960]   So we didn't have insurance.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.280]   We paid the church bills and then whatever left over came to my family to support.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.800]   And that was probably the first maybe six years of the church.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:13.120]   I would say the turning point of the church was when we were at Lakeside Middle School.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   We got to a breaking point where I couldn't pay the bills.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.800]   I couldn't take care of the church.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.280]   At least number-wise, it wasn't going anywhere.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.720]   The church, you know, pretty much was at the same size.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.120]   We just kept on having to move around a lot because we had no actual location.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   Every year we didn't really know where we would meet next.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.320]   We didn't know if we'd have enough money, I feel like, because none of nobody was really
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.560]   working.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.040]   It was just very kind of fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of thing.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.840]   And so it got to a point where either I had to let go of the church or get a full-time
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.160]   job or do something.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.200]   But I couldn't keep doing what I was doing.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.240]   I had a conversation with Joe.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.160]   Pretty much he said, you know, the church is not strong enough.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.280]   If I leave, that they're going to be able to make it.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.760]   If I walked away from church at that time, I wouldn't have a clear conscience.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.840]   We had a house and found out that the equity in the house went up like $60,000, $70,000
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.200]   in like a year and a half.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   So we made a decision that if we got rid of that and used that to support our family for
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.440]   a year, and if at the end of the year we're still in the same place that we're at, then
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   I can just walk away.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.400]   Then I can say, you know, I have nothing.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.160]   I have three kids and I can't take care of them.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.600]   Like I can't keep doing what I'm doing.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.760]   Then I can have a clear conscience and start over somewhere and do something else.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.560]   It wasn't a plan to fold the church.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.080]   It was just maybe bring somebody else in, but I don't have that burden of taking care
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.600]   of the church.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.440]   We felt like God was waiting for me to make a decision.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.800]   Like, are you going to fully give yourself to this or not?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.200]   Either you're going to commit to this church plant or you're going to have to walk away.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.280]   And so that's when we decided, okay, we're going to give it a year, you know, from where
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   we are.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.480]   The thing is, our church never grew for the first five, six years.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.440]   By the end of that year, we almost doubled.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.520]   We almost had 50, 60 people.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.600]   By that time, our offering was the same.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   We ran out of money.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.760]   And then I was thinking about going back to work and just keep doing church at that time
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.500]   because things were changing.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.600]   And that's when the elders stepped in, which was at that time, Vince, Joe and Phillip,
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.960]   they offered to take care of our family with their own finances for a year until the church
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.120]   can actually support us.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   So for the next year, they supported our family.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.880]   The year after that, the church grew from 60 to like 70 or 80.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.640]   Each year since then, we've been growing maybe about 30%.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.720]   When we really started to grow was when we came to Utt Middle School.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   I think we had about 80 people meeting at Northwood.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.340]   And then we came to Utt and then we had 110 the first Sunday we met.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.140]   So we just thought, "Oh, they're coming to visit."
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.240]   But afterwards, we never dipped below 100.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.040]   And so basically, one Sunday, we added about 20 people and then we never dipped below 100.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.160]   Then during Utt, we went from probably about 100 to 280 during the three years that we
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   were at Utt.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.840]   After that, we were able to purchase a church in Airway.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   So we came to Airway.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.960]   And then from there, the number grew from 280 to like 480.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.640]   To be honest, really nothing has really changed in terms of how we do what we do over the
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.880]   last 20 years.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   I think it's just been people have seen what's happening and there has been a desire for
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]   the Word of God and teaching.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.240]   And I think during this whole process, I could name a few things that I suspect that caused
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.520]   this, but in the end, it was obviously God's sovereignty that he brought people who were
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.640]   itching to hear expository preaching and just the emphasis of the Word of God.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.880]   I really liked the church.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:10.440]   I wouldn't say I was a believer yet at that time, but I was very, very interested and
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.160]   it was very different from any other church I had gone to.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:18.600]   I feel like the biggest difference was that whatever they were preaching, people were
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.920]   actually living it out.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.440]   So it wasn't just like people were there for social reasons or for fun, which was my previous
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   experience.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.920]   His message was just really piercing me.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.640]   And he was speaking about a lot of things about the Bible that I wasn't used to hearing
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   him.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.720]   And it really started to speak loudly to me.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.320]   And so it made me come out more.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.240]   I just remember coming in and my first impression of the praise was like, what are these Amish
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:52.400]   people who do not have access to the radio and they just sing hymns?
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.200]   And so it was just kind of weird.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.920]   And then I remember the sermon feeling very long.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.040]   But I think one thing I remember, just my first service at Berean, was just Pastor Peter
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.480]   constantly going through different passages in the Bible.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.320]   And I remember that being the first time that ever happened to me before, because though
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.760]   I had gone to church my whole life with the same Bible, I remember having to peer through
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.160]   pages I had never opened before.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   And so I think that was one thing that really struck me about Berean, being different and
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.320]   just learning about Berean being a Bible teaching church, a church that really upholds God's
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.400]   word highly.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.640]   I feel like after 20 years, for the first time, we have the resources that we didn't
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.080]   have in the beginning, or even when I recommitted after six years.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:49.320]   We can take the blessing that God has given us and really look to what God can do with
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.680]   that, whether it's a ministry out in China or supporting missionaries or village pastors
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   in India, or even just locally, just discipling and sharing the gospel.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.560]   How are we going to strategically do this with the blessing that he's given us?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.400]   Because prior to this, we were just on survival mode.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.360]   We have this many people, how do we take care of them?
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.880]   And then we have 30 more people.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.760]   Well, we have this many people, how do we take care of the church?
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.000]   But for the first time, we're actually thinking about, well, five years from now, what are
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.040]   our goals and what are we trying to achieve?
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:27.200]   I could think of so many instances where we could have just folded.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.360]   And I actually wanted to fold.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.720]   I just couldn't because I just didn't have a clear conscience.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.000]   But if something happened and say, "Oh, the church is shut down, everybody left the church,"
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.880]   and obviously it would have been hard relationally, but I would have been relieved.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.640]   So I could think of...
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.720]   And even the church doesn't know just how close I came to just walking away, as far
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.280]   as ministry is concerned.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.720]   I can't say like, "Oh, because we did this, because we had this strategy and this is our
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.340]   vision, these were our doctrines, and because our church was organized this way, we discipled
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.840]   people this way."
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.680]   And obviously every church has those things in place.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.480]   But I look at 20 years and I don't think that's why we're here.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.360]   I really don't think that's why we're here.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:18.280]   I think God was glorified in the midst of our chaos.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:26.480]   And so after 20 years, we look back and say, "God just wanted to be glorified and we can't
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.200]   take credit for what we have."
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.520]   And we really can't take credit for what we have.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.200]   It was by the grace of God.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.280]   So that's why when somebody asks me, "So what do you expect in the next 20 years?"
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.680]   Like, I don't know how I got here, so I don't know how I'm going to tell you what the next
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.840]   20 years are going to look like.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.040]   All I know is just try to be faithful to what He's placed today, and then that will lead
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.280]   to wherever God wants us to take us.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.080]   So I would definitely say, "By the grace of God, we're here.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.520]   By the grace of God, we're going to go forward."
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:25.040]   We're probably going to put that up on the website at some point.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:31.160]   But again, it kind of captures in a short detail about what happened in our church.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.480]   I'm going to just briefly go over the history of our church.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.880]   I'm just going to read it off to you.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.040]   Again, many of you came to the church at different periods of the church, and so you would remember
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.280]   that, and some of you may not.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.520]   But again, I'm just going to read it off.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.360]   In 1997, January, Irvine Baptist Church EM became an independent church under the Southern
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   Baptist denomination with the blessing of the Korean congregation and some financial
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:04.960]   assistance from the Orange County SBC Association under the leadership of Pastor Jonathan Kang.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.760]   The name for the church in the beginning was Harvest Community Church.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.880]   Some of you guys may not have known that.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.480]   In 1997, April 12th, the church was officially inaugurated.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.920]   Soon after the inauguration, Pastor Kang left the church, and a vacuum of leadership was
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.120]   created.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.880]   Pastor Peter Kim, myself, officially joined the church in August of 1997 as one of the
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.120]   pastors to support the church while having worship at Irvine Baptist.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.600]   We were officially asked to take our young group and move out of Irvine Baptist in 1999,
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.920]   March, and began to use the facilities in Tustin Baptist Church.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.440]   We changed our name to Berean Community Church to better reflect our church's ministry philosophy
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   and focus.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.080]   In 2001, March, we moved out of Tustin Baptist and started having service at Lakeside Middle
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.960]   School in Irvine.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.560]   Our attendance there remained around 25 to 35 through those years.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.720]   2001, we also had our first summer mission trip to China.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.200]   And then in 2002, we had our first summer retreat with Pastor Ray Cosley as our guest
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.440]   speaker at Palm Desert with about 28 in attendance, which is also including the pastor's family
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.000]   and kids.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.440]   This was the first time in our church where we began to focus on the future of the church
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.000]   and its growth.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   Prior to this time, we were just trying to survive from one year to another.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.600]   2003, we moved to Harvard Community Park and our attendance grew from 30 to 50.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.000]   2004, we moved to Deerfield Community Park and our attendance grew from 50 to 60.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.400]   2005, we moved to Turtle Rock Community Park and our attendance grew from 50 to 70.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.680]   2006, we moved to Northwood Community Park and our attendance grew from 70 to 90.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.120]   In 2008, we moved our church to Utt Middle School in Tustin and our attendance grew to
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.400]   90 to about 280.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.440]   2011, with a generous donation from the church, we were able to purchase our first church
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.460]   property in Costa Mesa.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.200]   Our attendance there grew from 280 to 500.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.960]   2013, we planted a church, Berean Mission Church, under the leadership of Pastor Aaron
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:13.600]   Choi and his wife, Tina, with a team of 30 members in Millbrae, California.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.480]   2014, we began our first medical missions to India.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.400]   2015, we commissioned Pastor Alex and his wife, Jen, for mission work in China.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.440]   2016, in the beginning, we purchased this new building.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.760]   In 2017, March, we had our first church service at the new building.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.040]   And that kind of pretty much summarizes our church history.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.200]   I want to introduce a logo to the church, if you can put that up.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.840]   All right.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   Now I know whenever there's change, there's always going to be resistance.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.440]   And I'm already expecting some of you to persecute me after this.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.820]   But we thought it was a good time for us to refresh our church logo.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.280]   And the reason why was what I explained, that up to this point, we really didn't give it
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.480]   a whole lot about the thought of going forward, what are we going to do?
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.360]   And so we thought it would be a good opportunity for us to be deliberate.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.840]   And again, symbolically, it would be good for us to refresh our church logo and our
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.600]   name so that when we put it on this building, it would just kind of symbolize for us that
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.680]   from this point on going forward, we want to be intentional with everything that we're
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   doing.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.720]   And so again, I'm not going to go through the details of the explanation of the logo at
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.760]   this time.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.480]   But again, this is the sign that's going to be hanging outside.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.080]   And I'm sure our media team did a great job and put so much time and effort behind all
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   of this.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.120]   And they may be able to give you more explanations on that.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.800]   But I wanted to introduce that to you before it goes up.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.340]   But so that's what you're going to be seeing outside.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.040]   And the program, obviously, all of that is going to change on the website as well.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.280]   At this time, I want to introduce our speaker for this evening.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.880]   I think many of you already know Pastor Aaron.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.760]   Again, he led the church plant to Millbrae about four, you guys celebrated four year,
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.800]   fourth year anniversary this year.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.600]   And again, they've been thriving.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.000]   And again, we've been praying for their family.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.800]   As you guys know, the hardship that they went through.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.640]   Pastor Aaron was the first associate pastor of this church.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.720]   He was our college pastor for many years.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.520]   And he was very beloved and has continued to be beloved.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:32.440]   And when we sent him and the team up, it created a huge vacuum in our church.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.440]   And again, rightfully so, because he was so effective and he was so loved.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:44.120]   And again, and when anybody leaves a church, it should leave a vacuum.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.120]   It means that they were faithful.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.560]   It means that they were fruitful.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.860]   I actually ended up speaking at a retreat just this over weekend and Friday and Saturday.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:59.760]   And at the end of the meeting, they were giving me an honorarium and they made me this bag.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   And then they said that they contacted somebody from Brienne and they went down the list of
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.680]   all my likes.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.860]   He likes sushi and then they gave me some socks with sushi on it.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.120]   And then he said he likes basketball.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.840]   So he gave me some basketball stuff.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.560]   And then he said he's into beef jerky.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.840]   So they gave me a beef jerky.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.560]   And then he drinks coffee.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.400]   So he gave me all of this stuff.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.880]   And so everything that I like, they just nailed it.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.000]   And I remember thinking to myself, I wonder who they asked.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.120]   And three people came into mind.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.480]   One is my wife, obviously.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.720]   Esther may have been the one that told them.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.360]   And then the second person I thought is like, Pastor Mark probably knows because I spend
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.880]   the most time with him outside of the church.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.400]   And then the third person that I think of is Pastor Aaron probably knows.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   And so my immediate thought was, that's the most logical person he probably asked because
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.260]   he knows him.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.040]   And so again, Pastor Aaron and I spent so much time together while he was here.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.960]   And one of the things that I miss about him being up there that we're not able to spend
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:06.260]   that kind of time, but he's a brother that I love and God is using powerfully.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.880]   And again, many guys know he's a gifted speaker.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.280]   I think he'd be a great professor if he wanted to be, great communicator.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:20.400]   But above everything that I appreciate about him, he genuinely loves the Lord.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.880]   And that's the thing I appreciate about him the most.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.600]   I mean, as gifted as he is, there's a sincerity in his heart that I appreciate and I'm encouraged
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   by.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   So Pastor Aaron's going to come up here and he's going to give us the encouragement.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.200]   And then I think he's going to introduce a little video from his church before he begins.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   So let's all welcome him.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.640]   All right.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:47.360]   Well, it's good to see all of you.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.960]   As Pastor Peter mentioned, we do have a little video prepared in preparation for the 20 year
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   anniversary.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.640]   We were super excited to be able to celebrate with you guys.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.440]   I know a lot of our members up in the Bay, they would have loved to be here this weekend,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.700]   but we're all having babies and stuff, so it's kind of just too hard to do that.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.400]   And so this is the next best thing.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.600]   But please, you know, like the heart and just the love from which this video came.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.480]   Hope you guys enjoy.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   Hi BCC.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   Congrats.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   Congrats.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   Congratulations, BCC.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.000]   On your 20th anniversary.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's been a great 20 years.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   20 years.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   20 years.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Wow, what a great achievement.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   I can't believe it's been that long.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I remember when I first went to Berean, we were meeting at a park.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   It was about 90 people.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.760]   We had Bible study at Pastor Peter's house.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.320]   Everyone's crowded around, sitting on the stairs, overflowing into the kitchen.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   Probably my fondest memories of BCC was just listening to all the sermons by Pastor Peter.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   I just remember all the tangents, the crazy tangents he would go on.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.080]   But in the very end, he would always wrap it up and say something about Christ, and
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   that's how I grew a lot.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.520]   Thanks for seeing me through most of my life, through high school, through college, back
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:13.280]   when it was Harvest, through my marriage, and supporting us on our move up to Plant
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.880]   BMC up here in NorCal.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.360]   I just really want to thank all the pastors, elders, brothers and sisters who were really
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.080]   with me during my college years.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:28.720]   I really feel like BCC was a huge part of why I am the person that I am today, and I
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.440]   just really want to thank you for that.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.480]   We're so encouraged by God's faithfulness over your church for these past 20 years.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:40.360]   And so it's been great also to see how God has brought you guys so far, how big you guys
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   have grown.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.640]   I'm thankful for all the relationships that I was able to build there.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   And I'm so thankful and grateful to the leadership, to the members, to my friends down there.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.520]   But really, we want to thank Pastor Peter and the leadership team for just leading the
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.520]   church.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.560]   For just being men of the word and for always giving us guidance and wisdom.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.120]   Really encouraged by all of you guys and just everything that you've done.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   I want to encourage everyone to follow their leadership.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.000]   One thing that I know for sure is that they've been praying for you and they continue to
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.200]   pray for you.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.040]   And I pray that for you, Pastor Peter, that God will continue to use you and your ministry
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.640]   to glorify Christ all the more.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.400]   We're really thankful for all the support that you guys give us.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.000]   There's many of you that supported us moving up here to the Bay Area.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.080]   And we definitely would not be where we are today without you guys.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.640]   BMC up here is a fruit of your guys' labor.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   I only hope that BMC could be a place that models exactly what you guys have been doing
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   through loving each other, following the word, and glorifying God.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:57.600]   And I hope for many more years of BCC just committing to their community and loving and
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   supporting their members.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:07.120]   And praying that God would continue to really grow Berean in the next 20 plus years as well.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.680]   I hope that your church grows even more for the glory of God.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.360]   I'm really excited for you guys and what the future holds.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.480]   So I continue to encourage you guys to just keep being faithful to God and preaching the
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:26.720]   gospel and having that fellowship and just enjoying what God is doing in the midst of
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   you guys.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.560]   We love you guys and miss you guys.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.240]   We're very thankful just for all your support and your prayers and just your partnership
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   in the gospel.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.240]   And we can't wait to visit and see you guys again.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   Right here, okay?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.240]   Okay.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   Congrats BCC.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   I love you.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   I miss you.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   I pray for you.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   And I just pray.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   Say it one more time.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   Congrats BCC.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   Congrats BCC.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   I was watching that video before we showed it tonight and was just reminded of the fact
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   that so many people at Berean Mission Church are really originally from Berean Community
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   Church.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   And like Pastor Peter, I've been approached by church planners as well asking me if they
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.120]   have any, or if I have any tips or advice or counsel to offer as a recent church planner
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   myself.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.560]   And really the thing that I always return back to again and again is have a solid team.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.400]   Have a solid team.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.360]   And I don't think the team that we planted the church with four years ago would have
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.080]   been possible unless they had grown and they were discipled through the ministry that took
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   place here.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   And so we are indebted.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   BMC is indebted to Berean Community Church for just so many years of faithful ministry.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.760]   And it's again just awesome to be able to come tonight and to celebrate with you guys.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:15.080]   When you see the same person day after day, week after week, year after year, it's hard
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   to notice the changes they undergo over time.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.360]   Whether those changes are physical or emotional or even spiritual, change is just one of those
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.080]   things that's easier to observe from a distance.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.280]   It's kind of like the feeling you get when it's been a while since you last saw a kid
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.920]   that you used to babysit.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.120]   One day they're just cute, goofy and fun to play with.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.160]   And then you fast forward a few years later and they're six feet tall and they got facial
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   hair.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.680]   Their voice is about three octaves lower than you last remember.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.760]   That's kind of the sensation I had when I saw Jonathan, Phillip and Mary and Son.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.320]   I was like, "Where in the world did all this growth come from?"
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.040]   It's really hard for me to believe, but four years have passed since I was last a member
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.560]   of this church.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.240]   And so I feel like I have something of a unique perspective that I can offer on how Berean
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   has changed and evolved over the years.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.120]   I started attending Berean back when I was a freshman at UCSD.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.640]   And like many other believers my age, I was looking for a church near campus that I could
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   commit to for the next four years.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.320]   The problem was home for me was in Irvine, which was only about an hour's drive away.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:35.000]   And so every two or three weeks, which was basically any time I went to see my parents
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.760]   or I had to do laundry, I'd end up hitching a ride with a friend.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.440]   And I would find myself here at Berean on Sunday mornings listening to Pastor Peter
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   preach.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.520]   This was back when we were still meeting in Tustin and our attendance hovered around 30
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520]   people or so.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.560]   And it was about halfway through that first year in college that I decided to abandon
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:03.680]   my search for a church in SD, choosing instead to come home every weekend just so I could
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.560]   attend this church.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.320]   It definitely wasn't the most convenient thing in the world, but I figured the fellowship's
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:21.120]   good, the preaching's great, and I was growing spiritually, so what more could I ask for?
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:27.280]   And not once did I ever regret that decision.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.440]   Throughout my time at Berean I've seen a lot of change take place.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.040]   I remember us moving from Tustin to Lakeside Middle School and Elder Phillip coming up
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.000]   one day after the service was finished to announce that we needed to hold an emergency
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.920]   offering just so we could pay the rent.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.120]   I also remember that back in those days Pastor Peter would jet right after church because
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.640]   he needed to drive all the way to Vegas because he had a small business there.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:02.880]   He did that because our budget at that time wasn't sufficient to pay him an adequate salary
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.800]   and so he needed to work.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.640]   He needed to work to somehow provide for his family.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.400]   But you know what?
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:19.080]   Every single week at the end of that week he'd make that long drive back to Irvine because
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.440]   he also needed to provide for his spiritual family as well.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.140]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:32.320]   Every Friday and every Sunday he faithfully preached God's Word to us and we were fed.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.040]   We were nourished as a result.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.680]   I remember the church eventually outgrowing Lakeside and us moving to Harvard and then
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.440]   outgrowing Harvard and moving to Turtle Rock and outgrowing Turtle Rock and moving to Northwood
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.920]   and then outgrowing Northwood and us ending up at Utt Middle School.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.960]   I remember walking into Utt on that very first Sunday we were there thinking to myself, "This
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.480]   place is way too big for a church our size."
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   At the very same time I remember feeling this sense of relief because being at Utt meant
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   that our church would never ever, ever have to move again.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.440]   Of course little did I know that only a few years later we'd end up outgrowing that space
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   as well.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.280]   Thankfully by then as Pastor Peter described earlier, God's grace had enabled our church
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.080]   to grow to a point where we could purchase and move into a building of our very own.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.800]   In 2012 a first in the history of Berean.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.680]   And that was really crazy when it happened.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:46.360]   I know for a lot of you guys you walk into this building and it's still kind of crazy
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.680]   but as nice and big and impressive as this place might be you have to understand that
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.640]   Bereans back in the day we were used to being a bunch of nomads.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:03.560]   Switching locations every few years, going wherever the Lord saw fit to lead us.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:10.280]   And so the mere thought of settling down and anchoring ourselves for a long period of time
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.120]   in just one place, I mean that was a paradigm shift for those of us who had been with this
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.620]   church from the time that it was first planted.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.720]   So then you can see why moving into our own building four years ago or six years ago rather
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:30.200]   was such a watershed moment in Bereans history.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.480]   But not only did we move into that building but here we are today six years later in yet
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.440]   another new building.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:44.560]   A building that I hope and pray that the Lord will continue to use as he works to advance
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.920]   his kingdom.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.720]   Yes friends Berean has changed a lot.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.480]   Speaking personally for a moment I remember the exact moment when it dawned on me just
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.680]   how much this church had changed.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.720]   My family decided to come down on one random weekend and we were coming here to church.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.400]   We had rolled up into the parking lot.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:13.260]   I distinctly remember looking outside and noticing that I wasn't really recognizing
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.280]   a lot of the faces that were outside of the building.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.400]   And it was as we were walking in that morning that one of the college students who was serving
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.960]   on welcome team handed me a program and asked me if I was new.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   And I remember thinking to myself as I looked at him, what did you just say?
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.760]   I'll be honest with you I was super offended.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.740]   But at the very same time I was super grateful.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:51.020]   And I was grateful because I understood that all these new people who did not know me and
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:59.580]   whom I did not know were tangible sign and reminder of God's faithfulness to this church.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:04.000]   All that to say whether you've been at Berean for a short time or a long time it's probably
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.200]   somewhat difficult really for any of us to fully appreciate all the changes that have
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.900]   taken place here throughout the years.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.540]   But I also think that's the main reason why God has given us tonight, he's given us this
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:24.340]   evening a service celebrating 20 years of ministry to be an opportunity for us as a
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:31.620]   church to take a collective step back and to consider all that he has done and continues
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.700]   to do in our midst.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.280]   So to that end let's briefly turn our attention to God's word.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.520]   In addition to being an affirmation I'm also hoping that tonight's message would serve
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.620]   as an exhortation as we look to Berean's future together.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:37:02.700]   Turn with me to Psalm 127, the 127th Psalm.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.300]   Psalm 127 verses 1 and 2.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.580]   This is God's word.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.580]   Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.540]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.060]   It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:30.900]   toil for he gives to his beloved sleep.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   Psalm 127 belongs to a special group of Psalms that's generally referred to by commentators
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.780]   as the songs of ascent.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:47.100]   Each and every year all God-fearing Jews in Israel, they would make this pilgrimage to
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:53.260]   the city of Jerusalem so they could participate in one of three religious festivals that were
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.940]   mandated by the Mosaic law.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.660]   Since Jerusalem was situated on top of a hill, these worshippers would quite literally have
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:09.300]   to ascend as they drew closer and closer to the holy city.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:14.480]   And over the course of time it became something of a tradition among these Jews to sing these
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:21.780]   Psalms on their way up to Jerusalem, which is why they've come to be known today as the
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.300]   songs of ascent.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.540]   Now in addition to being described as a song of ascent, the inscription that precedes this
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:36.660]   Psalm also identifies King Solomon as its author.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.900]   As you guys probably know, most of the Psalms that we have in our Bibles today were written
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:46.900]   by King David, but at least a couple of them were also written by King Solomon.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:54.420]   As a matter of fact, 1 Kings chapter 4 tells us that Solomon authored over 3,000 Proverbs
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.940]   and 1,000 songs throughout the course of his lifetime, but only two of them have been preserved
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.500]   for us on the pages of Scripture, the Psalm that we're looking at this evening, Psalm
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.660]   127 and Psalm 72.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.980]   Now I'm calling attention to the fact that Solomon is a writer of this Psalm because
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:21.020]   it helps us to better understand the historical context, the background for what we're reading.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.540]   See Solomon, he was famous for a number of different reasons.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.100]   For one thing, he was famous for being David's son.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:36.940]   King David was the greatest king that Israel had ever known, and so his posterity was a
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:42.100]   subject of great interest among the nation's citizens.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.260]   Moreover, Solomon was quite famous for being a man who was very wise.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.500]   I think most of us are probably familiar with all the stories in the Bible that describe
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:57.460]   Solomon and his wisdom, his interactions with the Queen of Sheba, his settlement of a dispute
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.260]   between two warring women by suggesting that they divide a baby in half.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.780]   You guys know these stories.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:11.460]   But perhaps the defining aspect of Solomon's reign as king was a simple fact that he was
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:20.020]   the one specifically chosen by God to build the temple in Jerusalem.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:26.740]   Remember, before the temple was first constructed, God had made his dwelling among the people
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.300]   of Israel inside of a tent known as a tabernacle.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.380]   We have a picture of it.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.940]   There you go.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:41.620]   As I mentioned before, you know, Berean moved quite a bit throughout its first 20 years.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.500]   Well, in the same way the Israelites of the Old Testament, they were constantly on the
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.140]   move in the wilderness before they entered into the Promised Land.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:58.020]   For 40 years, any time God wanted them to start walking, the pillar of cloud and fire
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.800]   would ascend.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.500]   Any time God wanted them to stop walking, the pillar of cloud and fire would descend.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:11.340]   And so the Israelites, the nation of Israel, the people of Israel, they were used to moving.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:18.620]   Therefore, any house of worship that Israel used during those wilderness years needed
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:25.540]   to be as mobile as the people were expected to be, which is exactly why this tabernacle
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.140]   was so ideal.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:33.180]   See, not only could it be set up and broken down relatively quickly, but it was also highly
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.340]   portable and travel-friendly as well.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.660]   But here's the thing.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.780]   After Israel had conquered and settled into the Promised Land, the tabernacle had finished
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.500]   serving its purpose.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.460]   It had run its course.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.620]   Now that the nation of Israel had taken up residence in the land of Canaan, no longer
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.860]   would the people need a portable tent to worship God.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:03.340]   Instead, a more permanent solution was required, namely a temple.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:09.180]   And it was Solomon, the author of this psalm, who was handpicked and chosen by the Lord
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.300]   to be the one to build it.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.340]   We have a picture of that too.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.460]   Here's Solomon's temple.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:25.500]   Many years prior, it was David, Solomon's father, who initially proposed the idea of
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.620]   building a temple for the Lord.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:33.620]   In other words, the temple was originally his suggestion.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:38.920]   Unfortunately for David, God forbade him from building the temple because David was a man
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.660]   of war.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.240]   That is, too much blood had been spilt on David's account in battle.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:52.060]   And therefore, Solomon, David's son, he was the one who received the honor and the privilege
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.660]   of building a temple for God.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:01.500]   Now to his credit, rather than sulking about the fact that he was not allowed to build
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.420]   the temple, David took it upon himself to gather all the different materials that his
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.740]   son Solomon would later need for the temple's construction.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:21.440]   Gold, silver, bronze, iron, cedarwood, onyx, marble, and all manner of precious stones.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.580]   And after Solomon assumed the throne, he took all of these different things that his father,
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:31.760]   David, had accumulated and prepared for him over the years, and he wasted no time getting
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.880]   to work.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.900]   He recruited the strongest workmen.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.800]   He commissioned the very best artisans.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.700]   He enlisted the most skilled craftsmen.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:51.080]   And together, all these people, they constructed a temple.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:57.400]   A temple according to the specifications and design that David, his father, had received
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.720]   from God.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:10.200]   It was the crowning achievement of Solomon's life, or at least it should have been.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.080]   Follow along as I read from 1 Kings 6.38.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.440]   I believe the AV team will put it up on the slide for you.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.880]   It says there, "In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month,
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.320]   the house, that is the temple, was finished in all its parts and according to all its
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   specifications.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:36.040]   He, that is Solomon, was seven years in building it."
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   And so it took Solomon a total of seven years to finish building a house for God.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:49.000]   But I want you to notice what it says in the very next verse, in chapter 7, verse 1.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.760]   Solomon was building his own house thirteen years.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:02.220]   And so it took seven years for Solomon to finish building the temple, but it took nearly
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:08.400]   double that time for him to finish building a house for himself.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:16.360]   A royal palace befitting the wisest king that the world had ever known.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.560]   I want us to navigate through the remainder of our time together by addressing three specific
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.400]   questions for us to consider.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.880]   And the first is this, Berean, what are you building?
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.080]   What are you building?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.680]   You know, if there's anything that we can learn from Solomon's life, it's this.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:45.060]   Even as we are busy building something for God, we can be just as tempted to build something
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.720]   for ourselves at the very same time.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:56.280]   Even as we're busy doing the work of ministry, doing something for the Lord, we can just
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:02.880]   as easily, if we're not careful, end up doing something really for ourselves.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.560]   And if we're not watchful and vigilant, the line between those two things can become
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.140]   easily blurred.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.320]   As much as I hate to admit it, I think church leaders are especially vulnerable to this.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.360]   You know, when we first planted BMC, and I saw the church beginning to grow, I will admit
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.520]   to you guys that I got really excited.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.720]   And the reason why I got excited was because I knew that there were a ton of church plants
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.560]   throughout the Bay Area that were struggling to get off the ground, but for whatever reason,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.000]   that was never our problem.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.560]   People were coming, and the church was getting bigger, and by all accounts, our ministry
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.360]   was thriving.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:44.080]   But after a while, in the height of my excitement, I had to do a gut check, and I had to ask
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.720]   myself a really important question.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:51.120]   The question was this, what am I excited about?
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.920]   What am I actually excited about?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:02.840]   Am I excited because our numbers are increasing, or because God's kingdom is expanding?
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:09.120]   Am I excited because BMC is growing, or because people's faith is deepening?
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:15.880]   I mean, consider all the metrics that we so oftentimes use to gauge ministry success in
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.360]   the church these days.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.120]   Attendance, the size of the budget, the fruitfulness of our programs, the production value of our
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.080]   services.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.320]   No doubt we should strive for excellence.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.080]   We should strive for success in all things related to ministry.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:37.960]   However, if we are not vigilant, we can easily fall prey to the inherent desire that all
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:46.440]   of us struggle with, which is to make much of ourselves, to make much of who we are.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.100]   And so we need to be careful.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.840]   We need to be careful because we live in a culture of self-promotion, where we measure
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:01.560]   our value and worth based on how many likes we have, how many followers we've gained,
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:08.040]   how much influence we wield, how many people we know, how much recognition we've received.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.320]   I'm not above that, even as a pastor, and neither are you.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:20.200]   But beloved, this church, Berean Community Church, has never been about any of those
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   things.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.480]   One of the most important questions that you and this church can ask yourselves is, "What
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.680]   are we building?"
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.200]   Are we investing in people?
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.600]   Are we making disciples?
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.380]   Are we preaching the good news?
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:44.060]   We need to ask these types of questions because, frankly speaking, nothing else matters in
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   ministry.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.400]   We can do a whole lot.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.960]   People can come and be excited to be a part of Berean, but at the end of the day, it does
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.840]   not mean a thing if all we're doing is building our own little kingdom here on earth.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.480]   Believe it or not, no one knew this better than King Solomon.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:11.160]   You see, years after he had finished building the temple, years after he had finished building
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.800]   a palace complex for himself, he said this in Ecclesiastes chapter 2.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.000]   Go ahead and keep your fingers in Psalm 127, but flip over with me to Ecclesiastes chapter
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   2.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.960]   It's just a couple books over.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:36.360]   This is what Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes chapter 2, beginning from verse 4.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.200]   I made great works.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.080]   I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.500]   I made myself gardens and parks and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.240]   I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.320]   I bought male and female slaves and had slaves who were born in my house.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:02.600]   I had also great possessions of herds and flocks more than any who had been before me
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.560]   in Jerusalem.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.920]   I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:16.880]   I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Verse 9, so I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:29.240]   Also my wisdom remained with me and whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:35.040]   I kept my heart from no pleasure for my heart found pleasure in all my toil and this was
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   my reward for all my toil.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   Look at verse 11.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:49.640]   Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I expended in doing it and behold,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:56.000]   all was vanity.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   All was vanity in a striving after wind and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.040]   Berean, you guys have an amazing building.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   You guys have a wonderful ministry.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.560]   You guys have great pastors and solid leaders.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.100]   You have an arsenal of volunteers and servants at your disposal.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:27.080]   You have money and you have manpower and you have resources that virtually every other
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.440]   church around you would envy.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:36.040]   Be encouraged by how much the Lord has blessed you.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:44.920]   But having said that, know this, it's all vanity if it's not for Christ.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   It's all completely pointless.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   Again, ask yourselves, what are we building here?
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.520]   What are we investing in?
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.400]   What are we giving ourselves to?
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.160]   How is our time being spent?
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.400]   How are our finances being utilized?
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.900]   What is this ministry ultimately about?
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:13.040]   Is it to build the kingdom of Berean or are we seeking to build the kingdom of God?
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:21.620]   Are we trying to promote ourselves or are we seeking to proclaim Christ?
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:28.200]   If you have reason to celebrate anything tonight, and I believe you most certainly do, it's
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.360]   not because this church is big and it's not because this building is nice and it's not
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.520]   because the finances are now finally stable.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:43.640]   Instead, the real reason for us to celebrate this evening is because for the last 20 years,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:52.080]   God by his grace has used Berean Community Church to convert sinners, to make disciples,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:53:00.320]   to teach his word and to preach the gospel and lives have been changed as a result.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   Just look around you.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.560]   Keep focused on building the kingdom of God.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.860]   We've considered the question, what are we building?
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.680]   But I'd like to follow that up with a second question.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:18.880]   The question is this, how are we building it?
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.120]   Turning our attentions back to Psalm 127, let me read it again, it's short.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.280]   Psalm 127 verses 1 and 2, "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.280]   in vain.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.240]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:37.040]   It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.800]   toil, for he gives to his beloved sleep."
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:48.160]   Here in verse 1, Solomon uses a rhetorical device that's known as Hebrew parallelism.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.440]   It's very common in Old Testament wisdom and poetry literature.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.840]   Hebrew parallelism occurs whenever a single idea is being expressed in multiple ways.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.160]   So again, if you look at verse 1, it says, "Unless the Lord builds the house, those
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.360]   who build it labor in vain."
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   That's statement one.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.080]   It's followed by another statement, "Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.600]   stays awake in vain."
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.840]   So you got two statements that essentially say the same thing.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:20.080]   Also notice that Solomon, he seeks to further his argument by means of repetition.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.520]   Observe how the phrase "in vain" is repeated three times throughout the course of these
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   two verses.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.120]   "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.480]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:41.400]   It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest."
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:48.360]   And so the primary idea that Solomon is driving home here is the utter vanity of trying to
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:54.040]   do anything by our own strength and effort alone.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:59.360]   In other words, the folly of human arrogance and pride is buying into the illusion that
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.680]   we can do anything apart from God.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.360]   Pursuing the things that this church has been pursuing for the last 20 years.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:14.280]   Ministry success, ministry fruitfulness, but doing so without divine enablement.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.640]   It is a completely pointless endeavor.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.440]   That is what Solomon is trying to convey.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.600]   Sure, we may achieve some favorable outcomes.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:31.440]   Sure, we may even see some positive results with little to no dependence upon the Spirit
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:38.520]   of God, but none of it will mean a thing if God is not blessing us.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:45.360]   Whether we know it or not, you and I and this church is absolutely and totally dependent
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.840]   and reliant upon God for everything, for everything that we do.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   Especially when it comes to ministry.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:59.680]   No amount of worldly success can deny that truth.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:06.720]   If we hope for Berean Community Church to continue having an enduring impact, a lasting
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:14.280]   legacy here on earth, it has to come about by a wholehearted commitment, a wholehearted
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.760]   reliance upon Christ.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:24.040]   Earlier this week, I was having dinner with some people here, and I don't know how many
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:31.960]   times I said something along the lines of, "I wish at BMC we had a Sarah Kim.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:37.240]   I wish at BMC we had a Tanya Lee.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:43.080]   I wish we had a ..." I mentioned all you guys by name, I promise.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.720]   You guys are so blessed.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.160]   You guys are so blessed.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:55.200]   You have an amazing pool of talent and gifts here at this church.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.840]   But here's a danger.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:04.080]   Talented people and gifted churches are more susceptible to depending upon themselves rather
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.040]   than depending upon the Lord.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.240]   That's just our natural tendency.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:13.400]   As I reflect on the history of this church, the thing that I most appreciate is the fact
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:19.920]   that even though for the most of our 20 years as a church, we weren't the most polished,
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.680]   we weren't the most efficient, we weren't the most organized, we weren't the most impressive,
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:36.720]   the one thing that we could always bank on was that this church was a church that prayed.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:42.400]   That's a legacy that Pastor Peter and the leaders here have established many, many years
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.160]   ago.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.040]   This was always a church that prayed.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:55.560]   So then as Berean looks to its future, I want to ask the question once again, how will Berean
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.440]   be built?
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.720]   How will this church grow?
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.680]   Will it be solely based on the talents and skills of the people here?
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.160]   Will it be entirely dependent upon the knowledge and the resources that you have been able
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.760]   to acquire for yourselves?
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:18.560]   Or will it be because God himself is supplying you with the strength and the energy that
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.640]   you need to labor on his behalf?
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.920]   You are trying to accomplish things that no amount of human ingenuity can possibly engineer
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.520]   or manufacture.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:36.600]   The conversion of sinners, the making of disciples, you can't do that with clever planning and
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   strategy.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.120]   You have to depend on the Spirit.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:51.080]   God said so himself, Zechariah 4, 6, "Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.000]   the Lord of hosts."
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.720]   Remind yourself of that again and again and again.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:04.480]   Not by might, not by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.200]   Friends, only God is sovereign.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:13.800]   Only God is totally able.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.640]   So let's not only make sure that what we are building is approved by God, but let's also
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:25.240]   be sure that how we are building it reflects our absolute dependence upon him.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:30.200]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:36.640]   In all your ways, acknowledge him and he will make straight your paths.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:42.340]   Before we wrap up, let me go and raise a third and a final question about the church.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:45.600]   Who will ultimately build it?
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.560]   Who will ultimately build the church?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:55.760]   You know, the first ever occurrence of the word church in our Bibles doesn't come from
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   the Old Testament.
[00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.280]   Back in the Old Testament, God worked through a geopolitical nation known as the nation
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.840]   of Israel.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.080]   In the New Testament, God starts operating through a multinational, multicultural group
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.720]   of believers known as the church.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.880]   And the first time that the word church is mentioned is found in Matthew chapter 16.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:24.680]   There Peter, upon being asked by Jesus, "Who do people say that I am?" makes this famous
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.360]   confession, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.200]   And this is how our Lord responds in Matthew 16, 17, and 18, "Blessed are you, Simon bar
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.480]   Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:49.920]   And I tell you, you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.280]   of hell shall not prevail against it."
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:02.520]   Friends, Jesus has pledged to build his church and he vows that the gates of hell shall not
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.440]   prevail against him.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.400]   You know, I think some of you guys may be aware, many of you guys probably are aware
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:15.640]   of the fact that on this Palm Sunday, earlier this morning, halfway across the world, two
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.440]   Christian churches in Egypt were bombed by suicide bombers.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:28.080]   There were 30 people, 30 of our own brothers and sisters were killed.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.160]   And that is just a small reflection of what's taking place all around the world.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.960]   Hostility, opposition, antagonism, persecution are being waged against the church and yet
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:45.220]   still Jesus says, "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:53.100]   We know, we know this is a sure and certain promise that Jesus makes because Jesus loves
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.960]   his church.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.540]   The gospel tells us so.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.620]   In the gospel, in the good news of Jesus Christ, we are reminded that for the church, Christ
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.940]   took on human flesh being born of a virgin.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:11.400]   For the church, Christ lived a righteous life fulfilling the law.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.780]   For the church, Christ died a horrible death being crucified on a Roman cross.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:23.980]   For the church, Christ received upon himself the full wrath of God against our sins as
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.060]   our substitute.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.860]   For the church, Christ rose from the dead three days after being crucified.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:35.100]   For the church, Christ ascended into heaven where today he sits at the right hand of the
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:43.020]   Father and for the church, Christ has promised to one day return so that we might be taken
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.780]   up with him into glory.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:57.200]   But in the meantime, in the meanwhile, as we wait, Christ builds his church.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.140]   And so it's my hope and my prayer that we as Berean would be eager to join him as he
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.460]   does so.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:13.300]   Friends there is nothing, nothing quite like the church of Jesus Christ.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.860]   No other human organization, no other earthly institution can compare to it.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:24.220]   It is totally, utterly unique.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:30.940]   It is blood bought, spirit led, God ordained.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.780]   Berean tonight's anniversary celebration is not just an opportunity for us to look
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:41.380]   backwards, to think about all that God has accomplished in our midst for the last 20
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.380]   years.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.580]   This is an opportunity for us to look forward, to look ahead and to anticipate what the Lord
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:52.660]   will be doing for the next 20 years and beyond as he continues to bear fruit through you
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.380]   for his glory.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:59.300]   So I hope that you would take that as both an affirmation again as well as an exhortation.
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:05.020]   May Jesus be honored and glorified through the body of Christ here at Berean Community
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.020]   Church.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:10.620]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:18.540]   Our heavenly Father, we are thankful for 20 years of ministry.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:25.020]   We're thankful Lord God for all the fruit that you produced by your grace Lord God and
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.260]   through your spirit.
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:33.340]   Lord, we confess before you now more than ever, we are in need.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:38.340]   We are in need Lord God because no amount of resources or manpower or finances that
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.180]   are at our disposal is sufficient Lord God to accomplish the work at hand.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.820]   It is kingdom work.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.740]   And so we pray Lord that you would empower us, that you would enable us Lord, that you
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:53.340]   would remind us of the fact that we are needy and dependent people and that this church
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.220]   is needy and dependent upon you.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:01.620]   And Father Lord as you continue to use Berean Community Church and the saints that you've
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:07.780]   gathered here to accomplish your work, we pray Lord God that Christ, Christ alone be
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:12.180]   honored and glorified.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:21.220]   His name that we pray.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.220]   Thank you Pastor Aaron for a powerful reminder for our church.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:29.460]   And again, all of those three points are things that I pray that God would convict in our
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:35.220]   hearts and things that we follow and examine as we go forward.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:40.980]   Before we ask Dr. Proud to come up and he's going to wrap us up, just a few quick announcements.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.460]   We do have dinner ready.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.620]   So after this is over, I think the dinner is set up outside, right?
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.260]   Out in the courtyard.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:52.620]   And then while you're out there getting the dinner, we're going to move the chairs and
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.780]   we're going to set up the tables in here.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:59.340]   And so you guys can eat in here and then even if it gets dark, we don't have to worry about
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   lighting.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.580]   So if some of you guys can help us out.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:07.620]   One warning, please do not drag the chairs, okay?
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:11.940]   Because it'll scratch up the floor and we want to keep it, keep the new church smell
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.500]   as long as possible.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.100]   So try to, when you put it, don't drag it.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.620]   We have what are called dollies to kind of move it.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.020]   So if you can stack it up and then a few of the people who have the dollies will come
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.340]   and take it and put it to the side.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:27.740]   And then meanwhile, the other people will set up the chairs and the tables at the same
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.740]   time.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:33.820]   So immediately, if you guys can just move outside after we're done and then just we'll
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.780]   begin to serve dinner.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.020]   And while you're getting it, we'll try to get this room set up.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.500]   Okay?
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:45.380]   Before we close, I want to introduce our Dr. Michael Proud.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:50.060]   He came and spoke to us several years ago and I think a lot of you guys know because
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:56.420]   I've been telling you about Dr. Proud and how he's become a good friend, you know, and
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.620]   part of the reason why we've been getting more involved with the Southern Baptist is
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.300]   because of him.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:06.540]   And I met him through a friend's ordination and then we made a connection and really felt
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.700]   like this was a like-minded brother, like-hearted brother.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:15.340]   And every time I meet with him, I'm reminded that we're not running this race alone.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.620]   And so it's a great encouragement to know that somebody who is working for the Southern
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.660]   Baptist in this area is a brother that we can really rely on and lean on.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.260]   And so I've asked him to come and bless us in prayer as we wrap up.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:31.500]   So let's welcome Dr. Proud.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:39.060]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.380]   This has been a moving time.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:48.460]   I've had over the last six years the opportunity to get to know your pastor and Mark and was
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:57.280]   here when Aaron and his family left, when your mission group went to China, and now
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.420]   coming to this place.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:05.640]   You know, Southern Baptists for years and years have put on the cover of their magazines
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:11.900]   and their publications, those churches that have grown exponentially to highlight the
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.500]   things that they have done and how they've achieved success.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:22.300]   We still use a model of success by counting how many baptisms we've done, how many people
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.980]   are in seats, and how many, how our budgets have grown.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:33.660]   But I think that 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 6 tells us that Paul said, "I planted
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:38.940]   a Paulist water, but it was God who caused the growth."
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:45.860]   I wish that Southern Baptists had had a picture of Berean Community Church when it was five
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:52.180]   years old or six years old and struggling and making sacrifices because I think that's
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.180]   the picture of success.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:59.040]   Success is when God's people are obedient.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.140]   The growth part is God's business.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:09.060]   And I think that as we remember what Pastor Aaron said moving forward, I was challenged.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:16.300]   As we remember that it's God who causes the growth, our business is obedience.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:22.420]   And I pray that for the next 20 years and beyond, that Berean continue to move on what
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.540]   got you to this place is what will carry you forward.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:32.140]   I'm just going to ask if everyone, if you'll stand as we dismiss from this evening.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.660]   And thank you, Pastor Peter, for inviting me to partake and be a part of this.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.660]   Let's pray.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:46.500]   Heavenly Father, we recognize that as we celebrate this day, not only 20 years of ministry, but
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:52.460]   Father, also remembering the triumphal entry as you entered Lord into Jerusalem to die
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.940]   on that cross.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:10:03.620]   Father, I pray that this time will be etched in our memories, all of us, that we move forward
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.140]   by being obedient.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.180]   We minister out of a love relationship with you and we trust you with everything that
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.620]   comes out of that.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:18.860]   Father, may we be mindful that without you, we could accomplish nothing.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.780]   And so Lord, we surrender ourselves to you.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:28.540]   And we we ask, Father, that you might bring someone into our path, that we might share
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:33.580]   the story of how you touched our lives and gave us life.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.360]   Lord, we love you and we praise you.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.700]   May you bless us as we leave this place.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.380]   For we pray these things in Jesus name.
