[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Bibles to think to Hebrews chapter 2.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hebrews chapter 2 verses 1 through 4.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   so that we do not drift away from it.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and every transgression and/or disobedience received a just penalty,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   After it was first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, and by various miracles,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for the blessing that we have to be able to call You our Abba Father.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We pray that nothing but Your Word would go forth from this pulpit,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   that You would ordain Your words, Lord God, that You've put Your very breath in,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   to have its power over us, as You promised, Lord God,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   that the Word goes forth and does not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So I pray that You would open our eyes, our ears, soften our hearts, Lord God,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   that Your Word would penetrate as we are the potter, You are the potter, we are the clay.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Mold us as You desire. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [Pause]
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time, for a year, two years, ten years, thirty years,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   you can probably name a few people, if not many people, who at one point in your life,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   you thought you were going to be running this race together for the rest of your life,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and they're no longer here.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Maybe some of them are not just not here, but they're hostile toward the faith.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But at the time, whether you were in college or whether you were in your twenties or thirties,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   they were so passionately for God, and you probably couldn't believe that they drifted away.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But again, if you've been a Christian for any period of time,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   whether it's a year or ten years or your whole life,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   you probably know at least one person who drifted away and shipwrecked their faith
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and are no longer walking with God.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I remember when I first became a Christian, I was so excited about my encounter with God.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Because I grew up in the church all my life, and if you asked me if I was a Christian,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I would have immediately told you, "Of course I'm a Christian."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But I didn't know Him. I didn't have a personal relationship with Him.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It was just some figurehead that my dad preached.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But when I became a Christian, it was such a radical conversion.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Like overnight, I got bopped over the head.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's like, "Oh my gosh, this God that I sang to, memorized Scripture, He's actually real.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And He loves me, and He forgave my sins."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So I was so excited. So me and my friend went back home,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and I remember we had an opportunity to talk to his older brother,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and we shared with him what happened, how we got converted.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So we were looking for an opportunity to share our faith, and we were just so excited.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We weren't trying to evangelize. We were just trying to tell him.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   This is what happened. It's so amazing.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And I remember his response to us was, "That's great.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I experienced something just like you when I was younger."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And obviously, he caught us off guard because he was as pagan as you can get.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If you asked me at that time, "Who is living a sinful life?"
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's the guy that I would have first chose.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We knew he was doing drugs. We knew he was engaged in all kinds of stuff.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   But he said, "What you're saying to me, like, 'Yeah, I met the Lord too.'"
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I said, "How can you have met the Lord?"
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And he said, "You know, I did, but I know I'm not living like that now, but, you know, that's what happened."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And again, at that time, I just couldn't believe it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   How can somebody who experienced the same God that I experienced be living the way he's living?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Well, that was 30-some years ago, and I can tell you now, from my own personal experience,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   not only has he proven to be true of many Christians that I have known,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I've come to realize just how difficult it is to remain on this path.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's very, very easy to drift, and that's exactly what Jesus said.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He said that the road that leads to eternal life is narrow and it is difficult,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and very few people will be found on it.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Not only am I not shocked or surprised anymore of people that used to be,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   used to be a missionary, used to be a pastor even,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   were hostile toward the faith.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   The Scripture that we're looking at this morning is warning us about drifting.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You don't have to denounce who Jesus is to drift, because that would be apostate.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   People who drift away from God don't wake up one day and say,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "You know what? I just don't believe in God."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It happens gradually.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   That's why he warns about drifting.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Most people that I know who have defected from the Christian faith
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   did not defect because of an event.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   If you ask them, they might tell you that I left the faith because I had an encounter
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and I didn't like our church or my pastor embezzled money
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   or I didn't like certain people and I was disappointed and people let me down,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   they're a bunch of hypocrites, they might tell you an event that may have happened.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But most people that I know do not defect from their faith because of an event.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I know plenty of people who face all kinds of tragedies,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   all kinds of disappointment in the church and are thriving in their faith.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   From my personal observation and experience,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   the majority of people who defected from the faith,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   again, it didn't happen because of an event and they were so traumatized
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and they couldn't get over it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They were drifting for a long period of time before that happened.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And when that happened, that was just the excuse that they used to get out.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   When we drift, and if you happen to be on a boat,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   you know, that you're just kind of relaxing, enjoying the sun,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and you drifted out for an hour and you're miles and miles away from the shore,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   you get up and you realize, "Oh man, I shouldn't be here."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And you know you need to get back, but there is no sense of fear or danger
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   because there's no storm.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You know you shouldn't be there.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You know that you need to work to get back.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   There's no sudden danger, unless you have drifted and a storm comes in.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And when the storm comes in, you are in danger because now if your boat flips,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   you're going to die.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   That's the danger that you and I are in.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Because there's no persecution, there is no fire underneath our feet.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   When we begin to drift, there is no sense of urgency.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We know we shouldn't be here.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Our hearts have become hardened toward God for many, many years.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's been a long, long time since I've ever sang a song
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and really felt it in my heart and confessed my love for Jesus,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and I really meant it from the bottom of my heart.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We know we shouldn't be here.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Scripture warns us, but there is no sense of urgency to get back
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   because the storm hasn't come.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And when you're in that state, and one of these days, storm comes,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   it will flip your boat, and eventually you will use that to leave.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's been my experience.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   People that I've found who have defected from their faith,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   they've been in that state of floating and drifting
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   for a very, very long period of time.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   That's why there's a sense of urgency in the author of this letter
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   to not to drift.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   There's five separate warnings in the book of Hebrews,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and this is the first of them.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm not going to go through the five now.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But with every Christology, with every presentation of Jesus as who he is,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   he's greater than the prophets, he's greater than the angels,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   he's greater than Moses, he's greater than Aaron,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   he's greater than the priesthood, he's greater than the sacrifice,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and every time he exalts Christ, he ends it and sums it up with a warning.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That after knowing who Jesus is and confessing Jesus,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that you slip away, you fall out, you neglect,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   that there is consequence for it.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   This is the first of the five.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He says, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Again, so when he says, "This reason,"
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   he's talking about the Jesus that he's presented in chapter one.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The Jesus that he presented in chapter one begins by saying,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   "God spoke to us in the new covenant directly through Jesus."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So every believer, every genuine Jew, prior to the coming of Christ,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   they heard through the prophets in many ways in various avenues,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   but now he speaks primarily directly through his son.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   In other words, we're not looking at pictures,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   we're not looking at shadows, we're not looking at impressions.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   God spoke to us directly through his son.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   He made it crystal clear what his intention is,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   what he was doing in history, and where we are headed.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   What is the point of saying that?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   "Therefore, you must pay very close attention."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   There is no excuse.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He says, "Since Jesus is the radiance of God's glory
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and the exact representation of God."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   He didn't just tell us from a distance, "Jesus came."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   God himself in his glory came and walked among us.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   He said he is the exact representation of his nature.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   In other words, it is not some of God, it is not a reflection of God,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   but God himself.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Not from a distance, he didn't yell at us through the clouds,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   God himself walked among us.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   He took on flesh and there's an actual land where his feet touched.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He actually ate the food that we ate.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   He experienced the pain that we experience,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   so that he can become a sympathetic high priest.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   What is the point of saying all of this?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "Therefore, since..."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Considering all of this, "we must pay close attention."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "Since Jesus upholds all things by the word of his power."
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   In other words, God is sovereign.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   This God who is speaking to us, he's a sovereign God.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   He's the one who upholds all things by his hands.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   We live in his world.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We don't have our world and then his world and then we go back and forth.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   No, all of us are in his world.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Even Satan, the Bible says the God of this age is Satan.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But even Satan functions in his world.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   This God who is absolutely sovereign over all things,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   our very breath, the reason why we live and move and have our being,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   he is speaking.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   In other words, pay attention.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I mentioned in the beginning, when E.F. Hutton speaks, everyone listens.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Why do they listen?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Because he has good advice.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Again, you don't know who E.F. Hutton is now,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   but he'd be saying like Warren Buffett.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   When Warren Buffett gives you stock advice, everybody leans over.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Why do you lean and listen?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Because you want to make money.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Because you've been investing in stock.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   This guy is the best investor in our generation,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   made billions of dollars just from picking the right stocks at the right time,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   selling it at the right time.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   When he speaks, everybody who has interest in stocks,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   they lean over and listen.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   But that's where his knowledge stops.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   The sovereign God who sustains all things, created all things,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   everything is made by him and for him,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   when he speaks, and if you want life,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   in other words, he's saying, considering all this,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   you must pay close attention.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Not only is he all of this, he says,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   since Jesus made the purification for sins
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and sits at the right hand of the Father.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Think about all the people that we look up to and idolize in this world.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Movie stars, athletes, maybe great business people, billionaires,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   people that we look at and maybe covet in the secular world.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Whatever it may be, we look up to them.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   People look up to them, idolize them, want to imitate them for what reason?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Because they have something we want.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It could be an ability, it could be money,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   it could be their hope, whatever it may be,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   it could be their looks.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   But the people that the world worships,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   they do it for their own glory.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   They do it to get their own attention.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   They haven't done anything for you.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And yet the world is willing to spend tons of money
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   just to get closer to them,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and yet when we talk about the God of the universe
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   who is completely sovereign,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   that he stepped off of his throne
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and he made purification for sins.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Who sins? Your sin and my sin.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And yet we still struggle with our priorities
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   between the world and him.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   In other words, for this reason, you must pay close attention.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   If the Jesus that we worship, that we sing about,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   if this is the Jesus that we sing and worship,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   shouldn't we lean toward what he has to say?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   All of this is an introduction of what he is going to say.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   If this is the Jesus that we worship,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   that his name is above all the other names,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   that he is above the angels in his nature,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   because he is the creator,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   he is the one who opposes the universe, not the angels.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   He is the one who rules and he is sovereign.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He is righteous and he is ultimately immutable.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   He does not change from generation to generation.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   If this is the Jesus that you and I believe in,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   it is only common sense
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   that the response to that,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   that we would lean toward and listen to him.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And that's what he's been getting at.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   The whole point of what he's been getting at in chapter 1
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   is to lead us to chapter 2 to say, "Pay attention!"
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   If you're a school teacher and your children are running around
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and you have a lesson to give, he's like...
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   (claps)
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Or I've seen this happening,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   or you say, "Click, click," and everybody has to say, "Click, click."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And you have all kinds of tricks to get their attention.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I've seen some veteran teachers who are really good at that.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   They would say something and then, boom, everybody gets their attention.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That's exactly what he's trying to do.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   He's trying to get these Jewish Christians
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   who've been drifting away from their faith,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and he's trying to get their attention.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Did you forget who Jesus is?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Did you forget who you're worshipping?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   He created you!
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   The very breath that you breathe, he gave it to you.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   You're here because of him.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   He died for your sins!
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Stop being distracted by the world.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Now pay, pay, pay, pay attention.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   He gets us to chapter 2, "For this reason,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   you must pay much closer attention."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   It is threefold in redundancy.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   It's almost like, "You must, must, must pay attention."
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Now, whenever the Bible repeats it three times,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   what does that mean?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   For the purpose of emphasis.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   They don't have highlighters,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and they don't have clip art to separate.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   They don't have computers,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   so the way they highlight it was they repeat it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So when Jesus has something to say to Peter,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   he said, "Peter," when he has something to say to Peter
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   and he really needed to pay attention,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   what does he say?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   "Simon, Simon."
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   In other words, this is really important.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Everything I say is important, but this is really important.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   He says, "For this reason,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   you must pay much closer attention."
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   For this reason.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Pay attention.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   The word "pay attention," the word in and of itself
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   is a nautical term.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It means to get your ship to be deliberately on the right path.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Not just to lean and listen,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   but to actively make sure that it's going toward the right path.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Now, today, and I don't know if you guys are into sailing.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Obviously, I'm not.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   But I had a friend who was really like an avid fisherman.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   So he had his own boat.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And so a while back, he took me out on the boat,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and he was showing me how to fish and doing all this stuff.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And there's all kinds of technology now,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   so that you can catch more fish.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And I didn't even realize that there's like a sonar system
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   that almost every boat has,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and if you turn it on, it tells you where the fish are.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Yeah, it sounds like cheating, right?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   You're not a fisherman.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Anyway, he's been fishing for a long time.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   So he took me on the boat, and then he was fishing.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And then, if you have a hard time,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   they can actually radio each other and say,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "Hey, they're friends.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "Hey, who's out there on the boat?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   "Hey, where's the fish at?"
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And they will tell each other.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And then when you get there, you turn on the sonar,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   and it shows you where all the fish are.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And then you throw it down, and then you put it--
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   "That's too easy."
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   But now we've got all kinds of technology.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But a long time ago, before all this technology came,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   there's a reason why there was a lighthouse at the shore.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Because in the dark of the night,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and the storm comes in, and you don't see,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   you could work hard,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   and you're going toward the right direction.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   But if you don't see the lighthouse,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   you could have rowed, sailed, worked hard all night,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   and moved further away from the shore.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   He's saying, "Pay attention to stay on this path,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   "because if you do not stay on this path,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "you're going to drift."
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   You know, there's nothing more frustrating
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   than a couple who's working really hard
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   and are not meeting each other.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   When you have a couple where one person
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   clearly is in the wrong,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   and they're not making any effort,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   at least you know what the problem is.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   At least you know what the problem is.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   But a lot of times the frustration comes
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   when two people are working really hard,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and it's not going anywhere.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And you just sit down with an older couple
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   to figure out what's going on.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Is the guy dense?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He doesn't speak the woman language?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And the other way.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And so it's helpful to get advice from other people
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   when it's actually going toward the right direction.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Sometimes if we're not careful,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   we can put all our efforts,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   work hard to serve the church,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   sacrifice and give,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and yet be headed down the wrong direction.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Again, if you've been a Christian for any given number of years,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Some of the people who are the most bitter about church
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   are the ones who've given the most to the church
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   and just absolutely became bitter and angry at the end.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He says pay attention.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Pay attention very closely so that you do not drift.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   What does he mean to pay attention?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You know, there's another church in Revelation,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Church of Ephesus.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   On the surface was working very hard.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   They had right doctrine,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   they were testing to see if these apostles were true.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And so everything that a good church should have
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   on the surface, this Church of Ephesus has.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And yet Jesus says in chapter 2, verse 4,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   "But I have this against you,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   that you have left your first love.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Therefore, remember from where you have fallen
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and repent and do the deeds you did at first,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   or else I am coming to you
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and will remove the lampstand out of its place,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   unless you repent."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   You know, when we talk about a dried heart,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   when we talk about dried heart or complacent heart,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   we don't look at that as something urgent.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   We know it's wrong.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Just like you're on a boat and you drifted out for an hour
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and you know you don't belong there,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   but there's no sense of urgency to deal with that.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Because it's not like you're sinning.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   It's not like you're going and doing something,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   you're not doing drugs, you're not hurting anybody.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It's just your heart has become callous
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and you know it's become callous.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And the Word of God is not penetrating into your heart
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   like it used to.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   But there's no sense of urgency to do anything about it
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   because you don't see any storm,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   you don't see any consequence.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But look what Jesus says,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   "If you do not restore your first love,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I will remove your lampstand."
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   What is the lampstand?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's the church.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   In other words, God is going to withdraw
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   His Spirit from a church that does not love Him first.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   You can do the work.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   You can have a growing congregation.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   You can feed the poor.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   You can do all the things that a good biblical church does
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   on the outside,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but if there is no real worship going on in our hearts.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   He said, "I will remove my lampstand."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   In other words, that church is no longer relevant
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   because God is not being worshipped there.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   The consequence of drifting
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and allowing a callous heart
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   isn't simply feeling bad.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   There's dire consequences.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Some of you who are sitting in here
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   have drifted for so long
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   that you don't even remember what it was like
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   to be passionate for Christ.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   It's just a memory from the past
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   when you were younger.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I was like that.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And you live the rest of your life
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   always pointing back to when you were in your teens
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   or in your twenties,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   and sometime in college,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   "I used to be like that."
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And you become so cynical
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   that anybody else catches on fire,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   you say, "I used to be like that."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Let's see what happens to you
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   when this happens and that happens.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   He says to remember.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Remember.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Remember what?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   To pay very close attention.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's the same thing that he's saying
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in Hebrews chapter 2.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Pay close attention to what you have heard.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   To give yourself and remind yourself
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   to remember who Christ is.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You know in the church sometimes,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   you know who are the most mature people
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   in the church sometimes?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Are the brand new Christians.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And the reason why
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   is because a mature Christian
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   is not somebody who knows everything
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and experienced everything.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   That doesn't make you mature.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   A mature Christian is the one
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   who is the nearest to Christ.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   If the greatest thing that God desires from us
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   is to love the Lord your God
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   with all your heart, mind and soul,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   the one who is the nearest to Christ,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   whose affection is the deepest to Christ,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   he's the mature Christian
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   because he hears Christ.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Sometimes it is the ones
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   who are being baptized
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   for the first time.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   They are the ones
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   who are the nearest to Christ.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   When he says to remember,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   he says to remember
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   when you first met Christ,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   the very reason why you decided
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   to come to church in the first place,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   why you joined small group,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   why you gave your life to Christ
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   and repented and came to him.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Remember the height
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   from which you had fallen.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   He's not talking about,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   remember those days
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   when you used to lead
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   all these Bible studies?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Remember how many people
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that used to share the gospel?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Remember when you used
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   to memorize scripture?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   All of these things are great things,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   but that's not what he's pointing to
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   because this church
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   was already doing that.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   This church was already doing
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   all the necessary things
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   that a good Christian is supposed to do,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   but their indictment isn't
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   that they weren't doing this.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He says, "No, you have forsaken
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   your first love.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Your heart has drifted so far from me.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   You have forgotten who I am.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Remember the height
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   from which you had fallen."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And then he says to repent.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It is not enough to remember
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   where we were at.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   If that's all that remains,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   so many of us,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   we just remember back then,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   hoping that our circumstances,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   something would happen in our life
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   to kind of get us to go over there,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and we live the rest
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   of our lives like that.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And we admire young Christians
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   who are on fire for God,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   but it's never us.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And somehow we have resolved
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   that a passion for Jesus Christ
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   is for the youth,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   not for older people,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   not for people who've been walking
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and have children, raised kids,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and have just experienced
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   the reality of living
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   in this sinful world.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   That's not for us.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That's for youth.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And we don't even equate that
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   with the Holy Spirit anymore.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   We just equate that with youth.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Young people do that.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It is not enough for us to remember.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   He calls us to repent
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and return.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   That it's not okay
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   just to be floating around,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   knowing full well
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   we are so far from where we ought to be.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   He says to repent,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   and then he says to redo.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Now you look at that and say,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   "Well, redo? Redo what?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   They're doing all this stuff."
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   There is a world of difference
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   between somebody who is working hard
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   with a heart that has drifted away from God
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   versus somebody who is working hard
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   because they remember,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   because they repent,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and that causes them to do.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And if it is not in that order,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   we become Pharisees.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   That's what makes a church
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   an ugly place to be.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   A church who is working so hard
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   to become A+ students in the kingdom.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   It becomes either an ugly place
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   of people who are examining
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   other people's lives
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   to make sure that everybody is doing
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   what they're supposed to do
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   versus a church who has been impacted
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   by the love of Christ.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And it is an overflow
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   because he first loved me,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I love.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   So I am doing all of these things
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   because I've been impacted
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   by what I remember of what he has done.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   It is a world of difference.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   So when he says to remember,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   repent, and redo,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   he's calling us back
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   to our first love.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Let me give you some practical things
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that you can focus on.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   When your heart has drifted,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   our natural inclination
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   is to blame our circumstance.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I don't have enough leaders,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I don't have peers,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I don't have this,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   and I don't have that.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Before you blame your drifting
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   to your circumstance,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   if you're not regularly
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   in the word of God,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   if you're not regularly
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   allowing the word of God
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   to judge the thoughts
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and intentions of your heart,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   start there.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   It's been my experience
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   that if you're not regularly
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   in taking the word of God
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   on a daily basis,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and all of a sudden
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   you do that on a daily basis,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   you will be surprised
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   just how quickly your paradigm
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   changes about God and others.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Just by simply doing that.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Just regularly coming
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   to the word of God.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Not weekly,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   not during Bible study,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   but regularly every single day
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   discipline yourself
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   to be in front of the word of God
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and allowing it to judge
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   the thoughts and intentions
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   of your heart.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   If you're not praying,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   commit yourself to prayer.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And I'm not saying,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   like some of you
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   who don't normally pray
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   to pray even 15 minutes,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   you know, it's intimidating.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   You know, how long does it take
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   for your mind to wander?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Especially this generation.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Right?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   You can't even go to a coffee shop
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   without music blasting in your ears.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   You know?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   The benefit of, you know,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   growing up in the 70s and 80s,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   at a certain time,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   the TV went off.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And so if you're a night owl,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   you just sat in the dark.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   There was nothing to do.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   You know, restaurants didn't open
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   past 9, 10 o'clock.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Dinner was served, you're done.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   You don't wake up at 3 in the morning
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   and say, "Let's go to L.A."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   To do what?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Only drug addicts go to L.A.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   at 3 a.m.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   What do you do at 3 a.m. in L.A.?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Now, I mean, you're so distracted
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   all the time with the phone,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   the internet, you know,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   there's not even a second
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   to sit and contemplate and think.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So to be in that state
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and all of a sudden to pray
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   quietly for 15 minutes is intimidating.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   But that's why it says to pray
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   at all times in all circumstances.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   If you're not in the habit of praying,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   just pray.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Is it okay to pray in the car?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Yes.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Is it okay to pray before you eat?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Yes.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   What about after you eat?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Yes.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   When you meet people?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Yes.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   In the morning?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Yes.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   At night?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Yes.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Middle of the night?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Yes.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   While you're talking to people?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Yes.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   If that causes you to love Christ more,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   that's more important than your friendship.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Get in the habit of praying,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   even if it's just a little bit,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   because that will help you to pray.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   At some point,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   that will cause you to be a prayer warrior.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   A prayer warrior doesn't wake up
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and start praying 10 hours a day,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   2 hours a day.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Just like if you're working out,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   you don't go in there
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   and look at these guys
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   who are lifting 300 pounds,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   and you look at that and say,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   "Oh, I can't do that,"
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   and you walk out of the gym.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   You go in there and say,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   "50 pounds is all you can lift."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Lift that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   That's where you need to start.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   If you read the Bible
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   and you don't understand,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   just one verse.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Start wherever you are.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I know so many guys
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   who used to lift 300 pounds,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and they haven't lifted in like 10 years,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and they realize, like,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "Man, I better go and work out,"
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and they go work out,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and they remember 300 pounds,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   like, "I should at least be able to do 250,"
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   and they put two plates on,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and they can't even do two plates.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   They take the two plates off,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and they can't even do what's on there,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and they realize, like,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   they're barely lifting 130 pounds.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   But they remember they used to do 300,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   and so they're so discouraged
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   they never go back to the gym.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   There's a lot of people
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   who remember what they were like
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   when they were in college,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and they see how far that they've drifted,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   and then they think,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   "Well, I should be here
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   because I used to be here.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I used to want to be a missionary.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I used to memorize Scripture.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   I used to do all of this,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   and we've drifted so far,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   and we can't meet that anymore,"
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   and so that discouragement
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   causes us to not do it at all.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Start where you are.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Repent and redo what you did at first.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   You didn't start with 300 pounds.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   You just started.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Take baby steps.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Take baby steps again.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Get back on track.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Don't accept your drifting.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Don't accept your callousness.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Don't accept that as an acceptable place to be.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   It's predictable.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He says, "If you accept that,"
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   he says, "if you don't pay attention,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   you will drift."
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   The word "drift" basically means to slip away.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   You know the person who is the most danger,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   is the one who is drifting,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and he doesn't even know it.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Again, that's the danger of the church
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   because sermon is preached.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   You'll attend every Sunday.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   The doors aren't going to be locked.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   People will be here.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   There are counselors.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   There are small groups.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   There are activities,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   and then if you want to be generous,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   there are avenues to give.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   If you feel motivated,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   there are short-term missions.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   If you want to serve,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   there are all kinds of ways to serve in the church,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and so we have all kinds of things
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   that are available for Christians to do,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   but you know how easy it is
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   that in the midst of all of this,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   your heart is calmed.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Drifting is dangerous
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   if you understand the context of this drifting.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   You know, when I was back in college,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   my parents owned a dry cleaner store,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and so, you know,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Philip was too young.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   My older brother was heavily into college,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   so I was the one available.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   So I would take classes in the morning,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and then I was at Biola,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and then by 11 o'clock, I'd get in my car,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and I'd have to get to Burbank.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   So from La Mirada to Burbank,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I drove from, you know,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   every Monday through Friday,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and then sometimes on Saturday.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And so sometimes, you know,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I was a full-time student,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   and so sometimes there would be, you know,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   finals and papers that I needed to do,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and so I was tired.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I didn't get much sleep.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   So 11 o'clock, I would go,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and almost every time I fell asleep,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I fell asleep in the same place.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   You know, like, I'm--
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   like, anything that I drive more than 30 minutes,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I'm a narcoleptic, you know, sleeper.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   I just pass out.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Esther knows, so she--
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   my whole family won't let me drive
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   if we drive long distance, right?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   For their own safety.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So I would always fall asleep in the same place.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I would drive from La Mirada,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and then I'd get past, you know,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   where the 5 and 10 meet,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and then right around the place
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   where we meet number 2, Glendale.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So it was like right before I get to Burbank,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   that's when I start falling asleep.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   You know, and so usually I would fight it,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   'cause I'm almost there, you know,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and my mom needs me to go and help.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   So I would fight it, and I made it.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   But there was a couple times
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   when I just straight up just fell asleep.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So I was on it, and then there was a--
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   you know, I was about to get to Burbank,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   and then I just--
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I lost the battle.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I was trying to stay awake,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and then the car started drifting.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And then if you--
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   if you know that area, you know,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   like, if you start drifting,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   it kind of goes, and there's an area
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   where it just falls off.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It's not a vertical drop,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   but it's a drop enough for about 2 stories.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   So the car started drifting,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   and of course I fell asleep,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   but I didn't know it,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and my front wheel hit the--
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   what do you call it?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   The water thing.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Rain gutter.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Right.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   I was born in Korea.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   In the rain gutter.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   So my hit--my car hit that,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and I got jolted awake,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and just instinctively I turned it,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and I turned to the left, right?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So obviously it shocked me.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I said, "Oh, my gosh,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   if the car didn't hit that,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   like, I would have just--
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   just went off of there," right?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And I--again, I don't remember
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   if seatbelt was required back then.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   [laughter]
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Do you remember?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Is that where--
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   this was 1987, '86, '87.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   It wasn't required.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   If it wasn't required, I didn't do it,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and I'm pretty sure--
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Even if it was required,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   there's 50/50 chance I didn't do it.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So, you know, that freaked me out,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and then that happened again.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   The almost exact same thing happened.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I fell asleep.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   So after that,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   now if I feel fatigue
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   or if I look--feel like I'm falling asleep,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I don't fight it,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   because if I don't win,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   it could be fatal.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And I've seen people,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   and I know some of you guys
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   who've worked on the road, you know,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   you got firemen and policemen
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and CHP officers,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   and you know, you've seen it,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   so many people who just fell asleep.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   They weren't drunk.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You know, this is before texting
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   and all of this stuff.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   They just were tired and fell asleep,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and they lost their life.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   When we talk about drifting,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   we're not talking about cars.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   We're not talking about Tokyo Drift.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   The consequence for drifting spiritually,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   he says, you will shipwreck your faith.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   You may wake up one day
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and realize, how did I get here?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   But the danger is,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   you can be in that church.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   You can be in the church,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   serving, maybe even leading,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and be in that state.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   The consequence of drifting.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And that's why he says,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   you must pay very close attention
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   so that we do not drift.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   We can drift simply by procrastinating.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   There's something that God
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   has convicted you of, but not today.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And that whole time you're drifting.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   You can drift from small compromises.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   You don't have to say,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   you know what, I don't love God,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I'm just going to do whatever I want.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   It's just small compromises.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You've accepted a hardness of your heart
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   to be the normal state of your life.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Why? Because I'm busy.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I have children.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I have a job.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   You don't know my pressure.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And so these small compromises
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   have caused you to drift.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Success.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Success can cause you to drift.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Because you begin to think that you did it.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And you become proud.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And you're not desperately clinging on to God.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Failure can cause you to drift.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   How come God allowed this to happen?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Why is He so unfair?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Why isn't He doing this to me?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Status quo of doing nothing.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Sometimes that's the greatest danger.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   We just kind of be lulled to sleep.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   That's exactly what God says
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   about the nation of Israel.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   When they were hungry, God fed them.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And then when they were fed,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   they were satisfied,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and then they forgot God.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   That's the danger that many of us are in.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Just to add a quote.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   There hasn't been anything urgent
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   in our lives for a while.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Working hard can cause us to drift
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   when we work hard toward the wrong direction.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Not working hard causes us to atrophy
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and to be rusted out.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Sometimes starting hard in theology
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   causes us to give us a big head,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and all we produce are a bunch of Pharisees.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Sometimes even loving people
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   for the wrong reason,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   expecting love back,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and then when they don't love us back,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   we become bitter and angry,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and we begin to drift.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   It's not that hard to drift.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   All you have to do is to not pay attention.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   That's why he says,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   "How can we escape if we neglect,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   neglect such a great salvation?"
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   You know what you need to do to neglect?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Nothing.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Nothing.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   There's nothing for you to do.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   You're not going somewhere.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   You're not doing something.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   You just sit there and do nothing,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and you drift.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   How can we escape
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   There is a serious consequence if we drift,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Hebrews 2, 2-3.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   "For if the word spoken through angels
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   proved unalterable,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   and every transgression and disobedience
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   received a just penalty,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   how will we escape if we neglect
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   so great a salvation?"
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   In other words,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   if we do not fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and we allow ourselves to drift away from Christ,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   all that remains is the judgment.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Everything that he said in the Old Testament,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   it is not subjective.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It did not change because of time.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It did not change because of circumstance.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   It's that all that God spoke through the angels
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   are unalterable.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   It still stands.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   If the grace of God,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   if we do not cling to the grace of God,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   all we are are men and women
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   who are under the law
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   and the wrath of God still remains.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And every word, every transgression
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   will receive just penalty
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   and it will be no different.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   We will not be judged by a different scale
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   if we neglect such a great salvation.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   If we do not cling to Christ,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   the whole world will be under this judgment.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   That's why he says in Hebrews 6, 4-6,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   "For in the case of those who have once been enlightened
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   and have tasted the good word of God
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   and the powers of the age to come
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and then have fallen away,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   it is impossible to renew them again to repentance
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   since they are again crucified to themselves,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   the son of God,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and put into open shame."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   In other words,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   if you had access to the only way to God
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and you just simply drifted away from him,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   there is no other forgiveness.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   There is no other path.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   There is no other way.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Nobody comes to the Father except through me."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   So if we neglect Christ,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   we drift away
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   and we simply fall from that
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and we are under condemnation,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   like the old covenant.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Remember, repent, and redo.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And let me summarize this morning.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Now, as I was preparing this message,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   if there is one thing that I have been wrestling
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   and struggling with as a pastor for 30 years is this.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   The challenge of ministry here in the United States,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   in Orange County, California,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   it isn't Taliban, it isn't persecution,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   it isn't financial.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   It's just constantly drifting.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   It's constantly drifting.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Revival comes for a minute.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Next time you turn, we're nibbling on something else.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And as soon as God hammers us and revival breaks out,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   soon after, we're nibbling on something else.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Our churches are filled with people
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   who have become fatigued with fighting,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   and you've just accepted this is life.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   If you allow yourself to be just taken by the current,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   your life will be so predictable.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Because I've seen it.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   I've been doing ministry with a certain age bracket
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   since I was 19.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   You know, you students,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   the most excitement that happens
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   if you're in college is September.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Because September is everything new.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Nobody's failed classes yet.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   So September is brand new.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   You don't have papers
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   that you procrastinated for three months and you're cramming.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's like September is exciting.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   You're all A students in September.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   That's where all the activity happens, this energy.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   So it's easy.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Freshmen are coming in,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and they're excited to start their new life.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   So any activity has the greatest attendance in September.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Christmas comes around, you get distracted.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And then you go on winter break,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   you know, you feel, "Oh, comfortable."
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Like you deserve your rest.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Because you work so hard.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And then the new semester starts,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   or new quarter starts,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   you don't have the same kind of energy in September.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Some of you failed your classes.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Some of you have already fallen behind.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And so there's fatigue that comes in.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   But you still have energy that you started in September.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And by February, March comes around,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   it hits you.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Because you've got to make up for what you did.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And so the hardest time to keep the college students focused
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   is between March and June.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Between March and June, you kind of drift out.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   So if you haven't put in your time and your energy,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and you have stuff to do,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   you're just cramming.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   This is when people are irritable.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   If you're dating, that's when the fighting happens.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Right?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Is it March yet?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Yeah, it's March.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   So we're entering that season.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Stay sober.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And you know, you get into college,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   and by the time you're a senior in college,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   you're kind of coasting along.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Yeah, I screwed up in freshman year,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   but I got next year.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I'm only a little bit behind.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   But by the time you're a senior,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   you're taking 35 units just to graduate.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Because you feel behind.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Maybe I'm exaggerating.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   22 units.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Right?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   You're so eager.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   But that's the current.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You graduate, and you're praying for a job,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   and you get a job, and you're excited.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   But that period, when you graduate from 22 to 24,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   is when it's the most dangerous.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Because it's not as easy.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   You're not with Christians all the time.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And all of a sudden, you're working 9 to 5,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and that excitement of having money and freedom,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   all of a sudden has become a burden.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And you begin to ask yourself, "Is this it?"
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Because there is no next stage.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Once you get that job, you're in that job for life.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   And then you die.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Or retire and then die.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And then that despair comes in.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Like, "Is this it?"
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   That excitement when you were young,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   you've already tasted some of it.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   And it's like, "Is this it?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Is this the grind?"
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   And so, statistically,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   something over 80% of people drift away during this period.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   If you're just going with the current,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   it's like, "Oh, where's my husband?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Where's my wife?"
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And you pray, and you start dating.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It's like, "Oh, thank you, Lord.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   You're so good to me."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Then you start dating, and things are good,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and you start struggling with purity,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   and you start having conflicts.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Some of it works, some of it doesn't work.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   And then I've never seen somebody dating
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   and come out of it on fire for God.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Because it's a struggle.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And so that's where the current takes you.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   And if things work out, you get married.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   You go on a honeymoon period.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   We're going to serve the Lord Jesus with all our might.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   We're going to do missions together.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   We're going to serve the orphans together.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   And then you realize you married a sinner.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You're serving orphans.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I'm having a hard time serving her.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And that's the current.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And then you struggle.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And then you drift.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And then you pray for a child.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   For some people it's harder, and some people can't stop.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   But you have a child.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And then when you have a child, it's like,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   "Oh, thank God we have a child.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   We love this child."
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Terrible twos, terrible ones, terrible three, terrible 15.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   The terrible comes in.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   And then you realize you didn't give birth to an angel.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   You gave birth to another sinner.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And then you have four sinners coming into your home.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And then all of a sudden, you say, "Wow, this is hard.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   This is really hard."
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   And the current will cause you to drift.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   If you are not anchored in Christ, that's where you're headed.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   No human being is different.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   I've seen this cycle over and over and over and over and over.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   And that's why he keeps saying, "Pay attention. Pay attention.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   All you have to do is do nothing.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Let life just take you down its current,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and you will find yourself one day waking up far, far, far away from Christ."
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   And that's why it's so important.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Is this the Jesus that you believe?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Then fix your eyes upon Christ,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.600]   That's perfect.
