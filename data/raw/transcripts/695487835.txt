[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   Okay, if you could turn your Bibles with me to Matthew 16, 13 to 16.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.060]   We're continuing our series to prepare us for the Passion Week that's coming.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.240]   And so I wanted to go through chronologically.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   We started in the book of Isaiah, the prophecies and the expectations of the Messiah.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.000]   And then now, you know, the birth of Christ and the announcement.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   And then now Jesus is headed toward the cross and he is transitioning from his public ministry
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.880]   to private ministry to his disciples.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   And so the things that he says here is to get his disciples ready for what's coming.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.960]   And so we're going to be going through the Gospel of Mark, chapter 8, 9, and 10.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.660]   And in those passages, the certain things that he says to prepare them.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.520]   But chapter 16, 13 to 16 is a parallel passage that I want to read.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.740]   And then we'll be jumping into Mark after that.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.400]   So Matthew 16, 13 to 16, and then I'll read verse 21.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.960]   Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he was asking his disciples, "Who
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.200]   do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880]   And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, but still others Jeremiah,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.200]   or one of the prophets."
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.480]   He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   And then verse 21, "From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.080]   to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and the scribes, and
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.200]   be killed and be raised up on the third day."
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   Let's pray.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.420]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace to help us to understand this text.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.320]   And as we prepare ourselves, Lord God, to celebrate, to remember, to walk with Christ
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.480]   in his last day of life, physical life, help us, Lord God, to know you, to love you, to
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.640]   be united in every way, physically, emotionally, spiritually, that we may understand his heart,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.900]   that we may understand his suffering, that we may also celebrate in his glory.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.840]   So we pray for your guidance and your Holy Spirit to teach us this morning.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   This question that Jesus asks his disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.800]   Based upon how you answer this question, your whole trajectory of life will change.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.600]   Now, I know that we'reâ€¦
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.880]   I'm talking to the choir here because we're inside the church, you're at a Bible teaching
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.600]   church where we're doing Bible studies, digging through scripture, so, you know, we would
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   automatically think that this is not necessary.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.680]   I would assume that you have an orthodox view of who Jesus is.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.160]   In our culture, we have all kinds of opinions.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.780]   Muslims, if you've ever talked to a Muslim, they'll say that they also believe in Jesus,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.080]   but the Jesus that they profess is just a prophet.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.640]   He just happens to be the latest prophet.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.120]   So if you ask them, they say, "No, we believe in Jesus too."
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.040]   But obviously the Jesus that they proclaim is not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.380]   Hindus will also say that they believe in Jesus, but the Jesus that they believe is
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.480]   just one of many idols.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   So as they worship all kinds of different idols, that they will just add Jesus to the
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.880]   many hundreds, thousands of idols that they follow.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.000]   And so oftentimes you ask somebody who's trying to share the faith with them, you say,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.320]   "No, we don't reject Jesus.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.820]   We believe in Jesus."
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.840]   But clearly their Jesus is not the Jesus that we believe in scripture.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.860]   Jehovah Witnesses will also say that they believe in Jesus, but their Jesus is a created
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.360]   being, a son of God, but not God himself.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.340]   So though they may use the name Jesus and the gospel superficially may sound the same,
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.320]   we know that the Jesus that they profess is not the same Jesus.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   Mormons will also say that they are believers of Jesus, but their Jesus is only the highest
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.800]   created being that we are to follow.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.920]   And eventually that we will, if we work hard enough, that we will also be like Jesus and
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.340]   have our own places to rule.
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.260]   And so the Jesus that they profess clearly is not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.200]   But we're not confused about this Jesus here.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.560]   Majority of us, maybe there's a few of you maybe confused, but majority of us here are
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   here because we know the difference between the gods that they profess, even if they use
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.120]   the same name, is not the same Jesus that we profess.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.920]   Our struggle is not with that, because we can see that clearly.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.880]   If you know even a superficial understanding of scripture, you know that the Jesus that
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.280]   they teach is not the same Jesus that we worship.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.600]   The struggle for us is even within the evangelical, even within what we would profess to be, profess
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.640]   to be orthodox in teaching, people have different opinions of Jesus.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.000]   Is Jesus an angry God who is always ready to pounce?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.240]   He's a holy, holy, holy God who will not tolerate any sin.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.780]   And whatever you do, like Jesus is going to pounce.
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.560]   And every bad thing that happens in your life is because God is punishing you for something
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.600]   that you've done wrong, because God is a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.680]   Or is Jesus an all loving God, that because He died for us, that even though He doesn't
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.600]   want us to sin, that even if you live a life of rebellion, even after, that God forgives
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.480]   us and He loves us unconditionally.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.500]   And that no matter what we do, God is not going to change our eternal destiny.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.240]   And so is that the Jesus that's professed in the scripture?
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.080]   He doesn't care about our holiness, because it's just about His holiness.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.400]   Some today, especially in the last maybe year or two, there's been a big divide in the churches.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   Is Jesus the Jesus of the social justice?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.800]   Primary call of Jesus, is He telling the church now that our primary task needs to be to feed
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.360]   the poor, the people who are oppressed, to deliver them, and so the churches have divided
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   over this issue.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.580]   Is that the Jesus of the Bible?
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   And so this question of who do you say Jesus is, is crucial, not only in our proper theology,
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:34.800]   but knowing who Jesus is, our understanding of the biblical Jesus has direct effect on
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.440]   how we run the church, what we teach, how we live our lives.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.400]   The reason why all this is relevant is because the whole purpose of Jesus' ministry with
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.000]   His disciples is to get to this point where Jesus would ask, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.040]   So I'm going to try to give you a brief timeline and the chronology of what is happening.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.840]   When Jesus asks this question, it happens right after Jesus feeds the 5,000.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.120]   And so the feeding of the 5,000 that is recorded for us in all the Gospels, but in particular
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.200]   in John chapter 6, Jesus feeds the 5,000 and every single person that was there, so 5,000
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.120]   is the number of men that were there, if you count the women and children, easily it could
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.220]   be over 20,000.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.640]   So this is the largest crowd that He's had and every single person there saw the miracle
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.960]   that Jesus performed.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   And so as a result of that, many of them said they wanted to forcefully make Him king.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.280]   But at the end of that chapter, Jesus says, "The only reason why I fed you is so that
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   you would know who I am."
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.280]   And His popularity grew so vast that He just could not rest.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.240]   So He would break away and go to the other side of the lake and they would find out He's
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   not there and they'd pack up their bags and they would not leave Him alone.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.020]   And when they finally find Jesus on the other side, Jesus says to them, "You do not come
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.520]   to Me because you know who I am.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.120]   You come to Me because you ate bread and you want more."
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.480]   In other words, you don't know who I am.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   So Jesus says, "I am the bread of life.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.880]   If you do not eat of My flesh and drink of My blood, you cannot have any relationship
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880]   with Me."
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:25.000]   And as a result of that, it says in John 666, from that point on, He said, "Many of the
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.540]   disciples stopped following Him."
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.720]   And so typically when we think of Jesus' rejection, we think of Jerusalem.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.340]   He's riding on the donkey, He's headed toward the cross and say, "Crucify Him, crucify Him."
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:42.680]   But the public rejection of Jesus actually happened right after the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.600]   So as soon as that happened, Jesus begins to pay, turn His attention toward His disciples.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.800]   So He takes Him up to the upper part of Galilee in Capernaum and He begins to prepare His
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.720]   disciples.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   And after Peter makes this confession, He begins to slowly, if you look at the timeline
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.460]   and the geography, Jesus begins to slowly move down Galilee to Samaria and then eventually
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.560]   to Bethany and then to Jerusalem and then to the cross.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.440]   So when He's asking this question, He already has His mind set to begin to move.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.740]   That's why after the confession in verse 21, it says, "From that time, Jesus began to show
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.500]   His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem."
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.060]   So in other words, that time meaning when the disciples finally truly understood who
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.320]   He was.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.140]   You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.280]   And He said, this is not something that you found out by yourself.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.780]   God had opened your eyes to know who I am.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.220]   So you think about it from the disciples' point of view.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.020]   I knew it.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.260]   You know, we suspected, but Jesus was always kind of like, you know, slippery with who
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.700]   He was.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.300]   Even though He did say it, but He says, you're right.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   This is from God.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   I am the Messiah.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.220]   Messiah meaning the one, I am the one who come to deliver you.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.380]   In fact, I'm beyond that.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.480]   Not only am I your king, I'm the Son of the God.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.020]   And so He says, after that, right, now that you know, now that it's confirmed, we're ready
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.660]   to do some work.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:22.060]   But right after that, He said, because of that, He says, I'm going to go to Jerusalem
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.540]   and the elders, the chief priests and the scribes, they're going to kill me.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.780]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.900]   If you're the king, you know, the disciples were probably thinking, well, if you're the
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.900]   king and you're the Messiah and you're the Son of God, let's go.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.780]   Let's go to Jerusalem and build this kingdom that we've been waiting for.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   We've been waiting.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.240]   All the prophets have been talking about how when the Messiah comes, He's going to overturn
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.780]   the world and He's going to bring peace and everything that they've been dreaming of is
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.060]   going to happen when the Messiah comes.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:11:00.040]   So the disciples were probably thinking, yes, we knew it.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.260]   But He said from that time on, He said, no, I'm going to go.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.260]   I am the king.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260]   You're right.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.260]   I am the Son of God.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   You're right.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.660]   But I'm going to suffer and I'm going to die.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.620]   Clearly it didn't make much sense to them.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.700]   And you know how sometimes you have this paradigm and you think one way and somebody says something
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.500]   that doesn't fit and you just, it just doesn't register.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.740]   Right?
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.300]   Now, I debated whether I should tell this story or not, but I'm going to give you a
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.700]   shortened version to this.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.900]   This is probably inappropriate, but I'm going to tell you anyway.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.980]   I grew up with three brothers.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.700]   So I was not around females much because we moved almost every single year.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:45.220]   So we had family friends who were females, but all three of us, we were just, you know,
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.220]   like this three of us.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.860]   So the reason why I tell you that is because I knew nothing about females, only through
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.860]   my mom.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.860]   Right?
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.620]   And so there was a lot of personal hygiene stuff that females had.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.620]   Okay.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.940]   And I'm not going to, you know, go into details.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.300]   I did not understand until I got married and people usually ask me like, didn't you take
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.300]   no health class in junior high school?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.260]   Clearly I was not a good student.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.260]   Right?
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.700]   And they showed charts and all this stuff.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.060]   And you know, it just didn't register.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.100]   And then after I got married, Esther told me like what every female, this is, I'm 24.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.540]   I knew nothing of this, you know?
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.360]   And when she told me, I was like, what?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.420]   This happens every month?
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.380]   I'm not kidding.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.300]   But the thing is I've been around it and I didn't understand this.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.540]   I was a youth pastor as early as I was 19 or 20.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.940]   And I remember, and there's so many stories I could tell you, but I remember one particular,
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.860]   we were going up to the retreat and we just stopped by the bathroom and I'm driving this
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.900]   van and one of the female teachers taps you on the shoulder and says, Hey Peter, we need
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.900]   to pull over.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   And I said, why?
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.700]   We just, you know, like 10 minutes ago we went to the bathroom and he said, we need
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.620]   to pick up some female stuff.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.900]   And I'm thinking, why do you need makeup?
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.260]   Like in the middle of nowhere?
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.840]   Like that's a, literally that's what I was thinking.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840]   We just went to the bathroom.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.260]   Clearly they can't go to the bathroom.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.020]   And by she's like, and she couldn't believe that I, you know, that I didn't understand.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.960]   She said, no, we really need to pull over.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.460]   So because they demanded, I pulled over and they went in and whatever it was, it was in
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.220]   a brown paper bag and they came back and the whole time I was like, Oh my gosh, I can't
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.460]   believe that I had to pull over to get makeup.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.220]   And that was kind of in my head, right?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.180]   I told you it was inappropriate, right?
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.920]   I used to be a janitor, you know, when I was 19, 20 years old, at Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.900]   And I, I cleaned bathrooms for eight hours a day from five to two in the morning.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.480]   And so whenever I go to the ladies bathroom, they had an extra basket in there that I did
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   not understand.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.400]   Cause there's a, there's a, okay, this is, I'll just finish it here.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Okay.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.800]   They have a separate trash can and then they have a separate bag inside the stall.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   So it was my job to empty all of that and put new bags in.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.280]   But the whole time I was thinking, why do they need this tiny little trash can in here?
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.120]   They got the big trash can outside.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   Right?
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.940]   Anyway, I, so many things have happened.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:26.960]   When Esther told me what, what that is, I'm like, what?
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:35.160]   And I can't, for days I'd be driving and it's like, Oh, that's why they wanted me to pull
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160]   over.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.520]   And I was like, Oh, that's what the bags were for.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   You know?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.080]   And one time I dropped it by mistake and all the content fell out and I did not understand.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.200]   It's like, Oh, that's what that was.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.160]   And like all that time my mom would have like makeup removers, but why does she need a whole
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.920]   bag of makeup removers?
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.840]   I said, Oh, they're not makeup remover.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.320]   It's like, so all this stuff that I didn't understand for 24 years, it just like the
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.360]   puzzle started coming together.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.600]   It was such a big part of, you know, every female's life.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.160]   I just didn't understand.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.200]   I heard it, you know, I heard it, I was around it, I've seen it, but because I didn't have
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:24.400]   a framework to, to accept this or understand this, I just had my own idea of what they
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.520]   were and some of the stuff was very frustrating.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   You know, it wasn't until that came into view.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.400]   It's like, Oh, all these pieces, like the puzzles just finally came together.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:41.080]   This is such a bad illustration, but, but I couldn't think of anything that, that illustrates
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:51.160]   this so well because the disciples, this is so bad.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.240]   I mean, the disciples like hearing so clearly.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.640]   All right, let's move on.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.560]   All right.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.880]   In Mark chapter 8, 31 to 37, Jesus said, "He began to teach them that the Son of Man must
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.200]   suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the scribes
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.160]   and be killed and after three days rise again."
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   And then verse 32, it says, "He was stating the matter plainly."
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.440]   So Mark goes out of his way to tell us that they shouldn't have missed this because Jesus
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.400]   made this very plain and the word for plain could either be translated boldly or openly.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.320]   He was not making it vague anymore.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.880]   But the disciples would hear this and Peter's response is, "He took him aside and began
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   to rebuke him."
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:48.960]   Remember, Peter is the one who just said, this is in years later, who just said, "You
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.560]   are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.880]   And then right after that, he takes Jesus aside and he rebukes him and the audacity
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.280]   of that, right?
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:11.800]   I don't believe that Peter was doing this for sinful reasons, not in his heart.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.720]   I think he genuinely loved Jesus and you could clearly see that.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.600]   You know, if you read the gospels, Peter, I mean, loved Jesus.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   He was so loyal to him.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:27.320]   In fact, Peter says in Matthew 26, 33, "Even though all may fall away because of you, I
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.520]   will never fall away."
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.600]   And I don't think that when Peter said that, he was joking.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.720]   In fact, remember at Garden of Gethsemane, Peter was the one who took the life out.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:44.360]   And if you read the context, historical context of that, the guards who came probably outnumbered
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.800]   them possibly a hundred to one.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.480]   And these are trained soldiers of the temple who came to get him.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.760]   And Peter took out a sword and said, "Let's go.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.760]   I'm willing to die."
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.840]   I mean, this is the guy who would walk out into the lake.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.840]   Most people would not have done.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.840]   What if I drowned?
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   He said he loved Jesus.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.280]   I mean, he just, he's a man of action.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.240]   So when he said, "I will never, even if they all do, I won't."
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.600]   I think he meant it in his heart.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.940]   But here's the key to what Jesus says, what went wrong, not only with Peter, but with
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.580]   all the other disciples.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.980]   Verse 33, he said, "But turning around and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.860]   said, 'Get behind me, Satan.'"
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   Remember this is the same guy where Jesus said, "Upon this rock I will build my church
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.480]   and gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.940]   You know, you can imagine the pride in his heart, even though he was referring to the
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.220]   confession itself.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.600]   Peter was the one who made this confession.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:47.440]   And to that same guy, when he says he's going to build his church because of his confession,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.560]   he says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.880]   Can you imagine Peter hearing that?
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.240]   It's like, "I'm Satan now?"
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   Right?
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.520]   You're going to build this church upon Satan?
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   What does this mean?
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   Right?
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.640]   But he says, this is what he says, "For you are not setting your mind on God's interest,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.320]   but man's."
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.240]   Peter was not rejecting Christ.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.440]   Peter was not running to idols.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.760]   But his pride and his loyalty was mixed.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.080]   When Jesus says, "The reason why you missed me, the reason why you don't understand what's
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:30.920]   going on is because you have the interest of man and not God's."
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:39.600]   The danger of misplaced love and loyalty oftentimes is our greatest fault.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.400]   Our problem is not oftentimes with the obvious false gospels.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.560]   We see it coming.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.480]   If you know the Bible, even just elementary, if somebody said, "Jesus was not resurrected
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   from the dead."
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   "No, I don't believe that."
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.200]   "Jesus was a created being."
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.680]   "No, that's heresy."
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.560]   That you have to earn your salvation.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.840]   We can recognize that, and that doesn't easily penetrate into the church.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.680]   But what we struggle with is tweaked priorities.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:22.760]   That in our loyalty, oftentimes to our families, to a decent way of life, providing, oftentimes,
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.880]   takes us away from what is best.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   Good versus what's best.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.920]   That's usually our struggle.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.760]   Not between heresy and orthodoxy.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.280]   Not between loving Christ and hating Christ.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.360]   Loving Christ, but loving the things that are good more.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.720]   See, good is a long life, loved by community around us.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.960]   That's good.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.560]   Our children, taking care of them, paying for bills.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   It's good.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.480]   Plenty of time to enjoy the hard work that we've done, and have plenty of time and money
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.800]   to be able to travel and enjoy nice things.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   Those are good things.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   None of these things are heretical things.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.240]   Buy some nice things and live peacefully with our neighbors.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.760]   Be generous to the people around us when they are in need.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.200]   Be gracious to everyone.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.860]   To love and to be loved by all the people around us.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   Every single one of these things are good.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.340]   But the problem is that oftentimes what is good competes with what's best.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.640]   What's best is whatever God desires.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.680]   To follow and trust, even if that path leads to greater suffering.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.400]   Maybe even forfeit sometimes what is good, so that we can have what is best.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.040]   Best is whatever leads to salvation.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.100]   Best is whatever leads to sanctification.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.360]   Best is whatever leads to glorification.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.640]   Best is whatever leads to the maximum glory of God.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.920]   Even at times when it seems to forfeit what is good.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:05.580]   See, Peter and the disciples had their minds set on what is good.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.860]   The kingdom is going to come.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.700]   Let me sit on your left and to the right.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.060]   And they were so fixated on that.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.980]   When Jesus says, "I'm going to the cross," it just didn't register.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.840]   Because it didn't make sense.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.440]   And so even as Jesus is telling them, "I'm going to die.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   I'm going to suffer.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.700]   They're going to pierce me."
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.500]   They're thinking of something completely off the wall.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.680]   He says in verse 34, "And he summoned the crowd and his disciples and said to them,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.700]   'If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.700]   me.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.260]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.780]   and the gospel's will save it.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.180]   For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.300]   For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?'"
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.760]   You know, we typically think of denying ourselves and picking up the cross means, you know,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:01.420]   God presents all these good things in front of us and then he says, "You can't have it."
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:08.100]   But in reality, what he's doing is the very instinct that we have for self-preservation,
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.740]   and self-preservation includes our family and children and our loved ones.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:18.780]   Our natural instinct for survival is killing us.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.740]   So what he's saying is, he's not presenting what is good and then saying, "You can't have
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.740]   it.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.660]   Now I want to live the rest of your life to suffer, to deny yourself, to win over temptation."
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.900]   And then when you get to heaven, hopefully in glorification, if you've taken enough shots
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:39.260]   to yourself, if you lived hard enough and sacrificed enough and suffered enough, hopefully
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.300]   you'll make it to heaven and glorify and then all your rewards are up in heaven.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.540]   That's not what he is saying.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.620]   He's saying when he says to deny yourself, to deny the very thing that caused Adam and
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.060]   Eve to live in rebellion.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.420]   When they rebelled, they didn't rebel, saying, "I want to worship idols and I don't love
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.940]   Jesus or I don't love God."
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:08.420]   They just wanted what God had for themselves.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   What's so bad about that?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.800]   What's so bad about wanting wisdom?
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:22.180]   But it is in their search for survival, they began to search for life outside of God.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.380]   And it is in this tweak.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:30.220]   And that's why Jesus says, "If you don't recognize that true life is on the other side of the
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:36.980]   cross, that you need to deny yourself, then you need to put away your old life."
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:42.660]   The problem and the struggle that you and I have is the temptation to add Jesus.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:49.260]   To have what the world has and I want to have peace of mind too to go to heaven.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.180]   I want to have all the comfort and all the peace and all the safety and all the proper
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.900]   education for our children to travel everywhere everybody else goes.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:01.660]   And then to add Jesus to that so that I could be even better on top of everything that I
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:07.140]   have, that I would also have the peace of mind that when I die I'll be in heaven.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.580]   Not realizing the very thing that you think is bringing life is actually is what's causing
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.580]   damage.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:20.860]   It's this desire to live outside, pursuing life, thinking that there is life there.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.980]   What Jesus is saying, "No, that's not where life is.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.300]   Actually that's leading you to greater death."
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.460]   And we hear it all the time.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.940]   We hear it in Ecclesiastes, we hear it from people who have gone before us.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.260]   We hear people who are multi-billionaires and have all the accolades of the world and
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.780]   then they jump off a building because something went wrong and then we just couldn't fathom
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.380]   why would they do such a thing.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.380]   They had everything that we desire and yet they jumped off it.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.740]   What was wrong with them?
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.940]   Maybe something went wrong in their childhood because it doesn't fit our paradigm.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:57.020]   Because we live all our lives trying to get what they have.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:04.100]   It is into that that Jesus is speaking to is our very instinct to live.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.380]   Is what's choking our life.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.820]   Jim Elliot, you guys know him.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.780]   The young missionary who gave his life.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.700]   And he wrote this in his early 20s.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:19.380]   He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to attain what he cannot lose.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.640]   This is a 22, 23 year old man.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:29.180]   He understood that true life is in Christ and he lived that way and he died that way.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:35.620]   And there's a reason why this young man who died decades ago, we still speak about him
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.220]   because it's consistent with what we see in Scripture.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:48.380]   Right after this encounter, Jesus takes James, John, and Peter to the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.780]   He made that confession but now he wanted to make sure they hear from God himself.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.740]   God's been speaking to you from a distance but now you're going to hear his audible voice
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.900]   to tell you to confirm before he goes to the cross so that they have these witnesses that
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.860]   can say after the resurrection, "I heard him audibly."
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.820]   So the whole thing that Jesus was trying to do, more than, you know, when you go out,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.260]   make disciples, this is what you need to do, you know, make sure when you go to this person,
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.540]   and yes, he did teach them that, but the primary thing that he was trying to teach the disciples
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.820]   is that they may be able to have the right confession of Jesus.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.380]   The right confession, right view of who Jesus is.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:37.140]   After that, Mark chapter 9, 30 to 37, "As he is making his way to Jerusalem, from there
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.180]   they went out and began to go through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know about it,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.860]   for he was teaching his disciples and telling them, 'The Son of Man is to be delivered into
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.180]   the hands of men, and they will kill him, and when he has been killed, he will rise
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.900]   three days later.'"
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.420]   So he's giving more specific revelation as he goes, but in verse 32, "But they did not
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.060]   understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him."
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:08.660]   You ever get behind in something so bad that you can't even ask questions?
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.380]   Like my parents moved around so much, you know, every single year we were in a different
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.580]   school, so whenever they would do something and I didn't understand, I just thought, "Oh,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.020]   maybe they were taught before and I didn't hear it."
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.420]   So I was embarrassed to even ask questions, you know?
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.380]   It's like, if I asked them a question, what if people laughed because it was such a basic
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380]   question?
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.380]   You ever experience that?
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.380]   Right?
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.820]   I'm sure you guys are too smart, huh?
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.380]   You were the one that embarrassed other people.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:45.580]   I think the disciples are so behind, you know, and they just, because they didn't understand.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:53.060]   Like you're the Messiah, you said, you're the Son of the Living God, and you're going
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.660]   to what?
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.940]   They're going to beat you and kill you?
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.260]   "Well, I don't get that."
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.420]   I must admit something.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.580]   Maybe Jesus said something early in the morning and I wasn't there.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.580]   You know, maybe I slept in.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.740]   Maybe He taught it and I didn't get it.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.940]   So they were so behind that they were afraid to ask Him.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.540]   Verse 33, "They came to Capernaum, and when He was in the house, He began to question
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.740]   them, 'What were you discussing on the way?'
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.160]   But they kept silent, for on the way they discussed with one another which of them was
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.420]   the greatest."
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.440]   So clearly they heard Him, right?
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.900]   They heard Him because Jesus, it says, Mark says, He said it very plainly.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.060]   They heard it, but they didn't understand it, so they kept on going.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.820]   He said, with their own framework, that when we go to Jerusalem, this is going to happen.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.940]   And so they, look at even the question.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.220]   They didn't ask who's great.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.180]   The question was who's the greatest.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:50.500]   Now every single one of them were great because they're handpicked disciples of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.980]   But the competition wasn't with the other people.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.160]   The competition wasn't with the Pharisees.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.240]   It was among themselves.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.440]   See if we were to compete with people who are far from us, every single one of us would
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.800]   wake up every single day thinking, thank God I'm in the United States.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.480]   Because we have more money than 99% of the world.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.460]   We have more freedom than 99% of the world.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.880]   I remember years ago when, some of you guys may remember the hanging Chad.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.360]   Remember the Republicans, Democrats, and the vote was so close and the presidency was in
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   line and that thing that they poked through because it was done physically a while back.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.760]   And then they had Chad that was hanging and say, did they actually mean to vote for, you
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   know, vote for Gore or for, who's the other guy?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.840]   Bush, right?
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.120]   And so they were fighting back and forth.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.000]   They went all the way to the Supreme Court and these guys who basically superpowers,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.200]   who had access to the military, went all the way up to the Supreme Court and the Democrats
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   lost and they was like, this is not fair.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.420]   And then they went back to work.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.360]   And I remember watching that whole thing.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.160]   If there's any time that a civil war would break out, it would be then.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   But it didn't break out.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.360]   They lost and they just went back to work.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   They're complaining and griping, but they went back to work.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.240]   And I was thinking, man, if this happened in any other country, it would have been civil
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   war.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.280]   They would have borne arms and went out to the street and physically try to take, because
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   this is unfair.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.800]   And I remember thinking like, this is a great country.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.520]   Even with that much division, the country was able to continue.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:36.480]   If we woke up and compared ourselves to other countries and people who are far away, we
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   wouldn't think like that.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.720]   But we don't compare with people who are far away.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.680]   Our natural instinct is to compete with the people in the room, people who are around
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   us.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.800]   And that's exactly what the disciples were doing.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.600]   They weren't comparing themselves with the poor people or the lepers or the blind or
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.960]   the tax collectors.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.360]   They compared themselves with themselves.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.240]   So the discussion was, who's the greatest?
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.280]   Who's the greatest in God's kingdom?
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.240]   Verse 35, it says, "Sitting down, he called the twelve and said to them, 'If anyone wants
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.800]   to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.'"
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.040]   You notice here at the beginning of verse 35, it emphasizes that he sat down.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.280]   Now, I mean, it seems insignificant, right?
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   In the context of this important prophecy of what's happening to Jesus, he said, "Oh,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.360]   he sat down."
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.680]   There's a cultural significance to that, because today, if we want to emphasize that somebody
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.640]   was really animated, would say something, he said, "He got off his chair and he began
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.500]   to speak."
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.240]   That's how we would express, like, this was important enough that he jumped out of his
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.960]   seat to talk to people.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:50.220]   Well, in that culture, for the rabbi to sit down means, okay, now, this is important.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.760]   Because the habit was he would teach and he would tell them, and typically, he would stand
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.500]   in front of the crowd and he would make his statements, but he says, "He sat down," meant,
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.980]   you need to hear this.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.980]   This is formal.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.280]   Like, this needs to sink in.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.520]   He sat down and says, "Your desire to want to be first is what's making you last.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.960]   And if you want to be first in God's kingdom, you have to be the servant of all."
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.920]   And then in verse 36, it says, "Taking a child, he set him before them, and taking him in
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.440]   his arms, he said to them, 'Whoever receives one child like this in my name receives me,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.160]   and whoever receives me does not receive me, but him who sent me.'"
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.920]   I've heard people say that he chose a child because they're innocent.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.280]   They're kind of dumb, right?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.600]   Dumb meaning that they're not going to challenge you.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:46.840]   So our faith needs to be like a child who, if God says to jump, say, "How high?"
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.000]   That's not why he uses the child.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.280]   He's using this child because they have no authority.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   They have no power.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   You know, you can take a child from a rich family and take a child from a very poor family
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.480]   and put them on a playground.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.880]   They play together and they become best friends.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.320]   It's the parents that will separate them.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   So when he chooses a child, he said, "You guys are all competing to see who's better
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.640]   and who's the greatest."
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.040]   And then he takes a child who has no power, no money, no authority, no honor, and he says,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.360]   "You must receive one another like this child.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.880]   You want to receive me, you have to receive me like this child."
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:37.600]   In other words, your whole paradigm, your whole paradigm, your pursuit has been tainted
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.680]   by sin.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:47.360]   You're desiring for honor, desiring for some people to recognize you.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.120]   Everything that we do, from the moment that we're born, we ask this question, "Who's the
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.960]   greatest?"
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:03.360]   You have a child, young parents who talk to each other, it's like, "Oh, they're walking?
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   How old are they?"
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   "Ten."
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.800]   "Oh, my child's not walking yet.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Something must be wrong."
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.480]   "Oh, he's two and he's talking?
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.280]   He's actually putting sentences together?
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.000]   My kid barely puts one word.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.880]   You're three, he's reading a book at three?
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.340]   He's doing what?
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.480]   At the age of five, he's running?"
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.200]   He plays sports like, "Oh, my kid is really good athletic."
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   "What?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   Really?"
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:35.240]   All throughout life, we compare and compete.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.960]   Then you go to school, "What school are you getting into?
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.560]   What's your GPA?
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.680]   What college did you go to?
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   What job do you have?
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   How much do you get paid?
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   Where do you work?
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.240]   What kind of car do you drive?
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.520]   Where do you live?"
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.040]   Then you get married, it's like, you start that cycle with your own kids.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.120]   "Oh, where are you retiring?
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.680]   You put enough money away?"
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.200]   Now, all these things are very superficial, but it's indicative of what's happening in
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   our hearts.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:12.120]   As soon as you walk into a room, we measure each other.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   Who's good looking?
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.680]   Who's dressed nice?
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   Who's taller?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   Who's shorter?
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   Who's built?
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.800]   Who's out of shape?
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.600]   So we measure ourselves internally and externally.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.800]   If we don't live up to whatever the standard is, we have self-esteem issues.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.760]   If we think we're slightly better than other people, we start to fill up with pride.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.600]   This instinct, this natural instinct that we have to want to live, has been completely
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.280]   saturated by our fault.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.640]   It's not just one thing.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:58.480]   It's our whole pursuit in life leads us away from the author of life.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.360]   That's why he says you have to go through with the cross, unless your old life dies.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.240]   Unless you recognize not just I sinned here because I lied and I did this.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:14.360]   Our whole pursuit, our whole paradigm of what we think is good causes us to rebel against
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.680]   God.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.760]   Not shaking our fists, but just day-to-day decisions that we make.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.420]   Day-to-day things like what frustrates you?
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.560]   Because God didn't give me what I think is going to bring me life.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.920]   People suffer with bitterness and anger because they have a paradigm in their head that this
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.040]   is what life looks like and God didn't give it to me.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.220]   Not realizing it's that very thing that's killing you.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.280]   In Mark chapter 10, 32 to 45, it says, "They were on the road going to Jerusalem and Jesus
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.480]   was walking ahead of them.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.200]   And they were amazed and those who followed were fearful.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.960]   And again, he took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.480]   saying, 'Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.740]   The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes and they will condemn
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.060]   him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:12.160]   They will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him and three days later he will
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   rise again.'"
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.300]   Every time he mentioned his suffering, he told them that he's going to rise again.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.420]   But we know clearly that they didn't understand nor did they heard him because remember after
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.900]   Jesus was resurrected, they didn't even go to check.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.720]   You would think that after Jesus went to the cross, it's like, "Oh, I remember him saying
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   that."
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.120]   They didn't even go to check.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.120]   The women go to check on him.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.160]   In fact, when they came back and said, "Jesus is not there, he's resurrected."
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.680]   Remember their response?
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.000]   "I can't believe you until I see it."
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.040]   Mark says he said that very plainly, but it just wasn't in their paradigm.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.680]   Why would the Messiah suffer?
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680]   Why would he die?
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.200]   Why would he have to be resurrected?
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.240]   And so even though they heard it, it just didn't go off.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.160]   But look at the response of James and John.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.820]   The two sons of David came to Jesus saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.760]   we ask you."
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.560]   In Matthew's account, it says their mother came.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.520]   And in other words, that this was well planned.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.920]   This was not just an impromptu kind of like, "Hey, hey, hey, I get it.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.260]   You're going to the cross, whatever, but can we sit on your left and to the right?"
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.320]   So in Matthew's account, the mother actually planned and went to him and sought a time
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.920]   to talk to him and said, "Hey, now we're convinced you're the Messiah and you're not denying
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.380]   it anymore.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.840]   Would you let my son sit on the left and to the right?"
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.080]   Verse 33, "He said to them, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.680]   They said to him, 'Grant that we may sit one to your right and one on your left in your
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.880]   glory.'"
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.360]   Can you imagine?
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.120]   These are his closest companions.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:00.080]   And James and John is, they already saw the transfiguration, right?
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.800]   And so, humanly speaking, Jesus was leaning on these guys.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.120]   If anybody should have understood, it would have been them.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:14.040]   Jesus just told them that, "I'm going to suffer.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   They're going to mock me.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.240]   They're going to strike me.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.680]   They're going to kill me."
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:24.160]   And the very next statement is, "Can I touch some of your glory?"
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.400]   That's what they were asking.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.480]   Some of you guys who are married, it's kind of like, you come home and the dishes are
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.360]   all broken and your wife is sitting there and she's crying her eyes out and the guy
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.080]   comes in and says, "What's for dinner?"
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.640]   Can you imagine the fury that you would be in?
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   You're so selfish.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.280]   Like, clearly something happened and your wife is hurt and suffering and all you're
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.240]   thinking is, "What's for dinner?"
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   Can you imagine what, emotionally, as a human being, what Jesus was thinking when they asked
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   this question?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:06.560]   I mean, I could easily imagine Jesus saying, "That's enough."
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.400]   And you see, Jesus had garden of Gethsemane.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.040]   He was going to experience the suffering that no human being has ever experienced.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:20.880]   Physically, yes, other people have been crucified, but he was going to bear on himself the sins
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.600]   of mankind.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.760]   And he was on his knees pleading with his father.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.800]   That scene in and of itself is such a strange scene.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:41.000]   The God of the universe who created us is so vulnerable at the garden of Gethsemane.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.320]   And he wanted his disciples just to stay awake.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:53.720]   That at least pray with me to unload some of that burden, humanly speaking.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.160]   And every time they come back, they're sleeping.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:05.920]   Can you imagine the frustration in Jesus that they would even possibly ask this question?
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.360]   But I mean, he is so patient.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.480]   He says, "But Jesus said to them, 'You do not know what you are asking.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.460]   Are you able to drink the cup that I drink to be baptized with the baptism with which
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.960]   I am baptized?'"
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.240]   And look at the way they answer, 39, "They said to him, 'We are able.'"
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.320]   It's probably the most arrogant statement that any human being has ever made.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   We are able.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.640]   Clearly, they didn't understand.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:35.240]   "Jesus said to them, 'The cup that I drink to you, you shall drink, and you shall be
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.600]   baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.800]   But to sit on my right or on my left, this is not mine to give, but it is for those for
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.680]   whom it has been prepared.'"
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:51.440]   Now Jesus is not saying that James and John is going to absorb their sins on the cross.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.280]   But what he is saying is the suffering that he experienced because of the cross, the disciples
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.680]   will also experience.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.960]   They're going to experience the suffering because of the cross as they share the gospel,
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.080]   as they begin to understand.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:12.440]   And so some of them were crucified, beheaded, burned at the stake, dropped in oil, and they
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.560]   experienced the suffering because of the cross.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:21.800]   But to sit on my left to the right, that's my Father.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.320]   So they did suffer this.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.280]   And verse 41, "Hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John."
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.920]   Now why were they indignant?
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.880]   Because they were thinking the same thing.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.120]   They were part of this argument.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.160]   Who's the greatest?
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.040]   They weren't indignant because they didn't hear Jesus.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.400]   They weren't indignant because they were concerned about what Jesus was thinking.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.380]   They were indignant because they wanted to bypass them.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:56.260]   How many times do other people's pride bother us because it affects God or because we feel
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.260]   disrespected?
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:03.220]   So the disciples weren't indignant because they somehow dishonored God or how dare you
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.420]   ask that question right after what Jesus said.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.820]   It's because they wanted to bypass them and be greater than them.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:15.140]   So even in their indignation, it was competing with one another.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:21.220]   How much of the suffering that you and I experience is because we live with this paradigm, who
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.780]   is the greatest?
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:29.180]   Now we're sophisticated enough that we don't say these words.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:37.700]   But how often do you learn something and the very next thought is, "You don't know."
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:43.700]   How often do you experience something and the very next thought is, "You didn't experience
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.820]   what I experienced."
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.780]   How often do you bear fruit and then the very next thought is, "You didn't bear the fruit
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.460]   that I bore."
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:45:01.220]   How much of our paradigm, even in our passionate pursuit of Christ, in the back of our mind
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.620]   is, "Who's the greatest?
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.420]   Who's the greatest?"
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:13.540]   Not realizing that that is what's causing us to be blind.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.460]   It's ruining our marriages.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.540]   It's ruining our friendships.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.620]   It's ruining our society.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.900]   And it's ruining the church.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   Corinthian church.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:33.460]   That was the heart of the problem of the Corinthian church.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.220]   It wasn't, "I don't want Jesus," or, "I'm going to rebel against God."
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:45.060]   It was, "Well, who should be sitting on the top spot?
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   Paul?
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.060]   Apollos?
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   Jesus?
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.060]   Peter?
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.060]   Who should be there?"
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.660]   The reason why they were competing with one another because whoever that they aligned
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.900]   themselves with, if they are in the top spot, that means we're going to be with them.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.140]   If we align ourselves with somebody who's better than the others, then we're going to
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.700]   receive some of this glory.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.580]   And that was ruining the church.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:22.180]   How much of our pursuit of our own glory is blinding us and is affecting our affection
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   for Christ?
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:28.220]   Verse 42, "Calling them to himself, Jesus said to them, 'You know that those who are
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:32.860]   recognized as rulers are the Gentiles lorded over them, and their great men exercise authority
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   over them.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.780]   It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:42.660]   your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be a slave of all.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.700]   For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.660]   as a ransom for many.'"
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:47:00.780]   You know, the greatest and the fastest way to be humble is to be humiliated.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.820]   I remember I had a youth student, you know, we were doing a study on Jesus's humility,
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.100]   and she said, "I really want to be humble."
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.100]   And she went to this church and asked this mega church pastor to pray for her.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.180]   And then she said, "How can I pray for you?"
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.580]   And she said, "I want humility."
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.220]   And the pastor stopped and said, "Are you sure you want me to pray for that?"
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.700]   And he was kind of taking it back.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.020]   "Yes, of course."
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:32.660]   And he said, "If I pray for this, God may answer through humiliation.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.260]   Do you still want this?"
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:42.580]   And I remember that that stuck with me even to this day because it's so true.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:47.700]   The fastest and the easiest path to humility is humiliation.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:48:01.220]   Jesus, the Son of God, deserving of praise from all of creation for eternity, the Messiah,
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:11.340]   the Son of the living God, was stripped naked for all mankind to see.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:18.940]   His family, friends, mother, companions, disciples, people who honored Him, loved Him, followed
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:27.060]   Him, they stripped Him naked to hang on that cross, was humiliated.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:38.100]   The only man who deserved all praise, honor, and glory was stripped naked, beaten, mocked
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.980]   for all to see.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.380]   All for what?
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.840]   All for what?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:54.740]   So that He can save the proud.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:59.300]   So He can save me and you.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:04.100]   So that you and I can come to this room and worship Him.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.940]   So our eyes can be open to the true life in Christ.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:25.140]   How foolish to worship this God and to live the rest of our lives thinking to ourselves,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.540]   "Who's the greatest?"
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.060]   How are we any different than the disciples?
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:41.460]   I pray that as we study, meditate, and walk with Christ toward the cross, that we would
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:49.840]   recognize the foolishness of the disciples and come to Christ with empty vessels.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.780]   So often we come to Christ with our cups filled, with our temptations, with our desires, with
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.940]   our hopes, with our pride, and say, "Fill me, fill me."
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:00.940]   Like, where?
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.940]   Where am I going to fill you?
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.900]   You're already filled with yourself.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.340]   That this Easter season, that each one of us would learn to empty ourselves.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.380]   Empty.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:22.180]   That we would come to the Lord Friday at the communion table, humbled before the Lord,
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.820]   recognizing what He did for us, through the humiliation that He went through, so that
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:32.300]   you and I could be called the children of God and come empty.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.020]   So that when we ask the Lord to fill our cup, that we would be ready to receive.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:44.220]   Let's pray.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.740]   Gracious Father, all glory and honor belongs to you.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.540]   You are deserving of our praise.
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.660]   You are deserving of our finances.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.820]   You are deserving of our hope.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.900]   You are deserving of our youth.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:07.320]   You are deserving, Lord God, of whatever life that remains in us.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.580]   You are deserving.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.760]   Help us, Lord God, to take our eyes off of ourselves.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:21.660]   Help us, Lord God, to recognize the foolishness of the competition, of competing, and thinking
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:27.500]   that there is life outside of you in any way.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:33.380]   I pray, Father God, that as we walk with Christ, as He deliberately made a choice to go to
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:41.340]   the cross and suffer on our behalf, that you would bring renewal, revival in our hearts.
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:47.540]   That whether we are mature Christians or whether we have just begun our journey, that Christ
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.860]   would be exalted.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.480]   Teach us, Lord God, to be anchored to Him.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:52:00.620]   Teach us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
