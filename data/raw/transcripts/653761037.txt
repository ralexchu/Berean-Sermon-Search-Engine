[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.800]   And we're going to be reading from verse 10 through 14.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.240]   And yes, we're going to be covering all of it today.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:33.560]   Hebrews chapter 10 verse 13 verses 10 through 14.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.480]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.560]   We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.160]   For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.040]   priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540]   For Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered outside
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.840]   the gate.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.800]   So let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his reproach.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.360]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.040]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200]   Heavenly Father, we pray for deeper understanding.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.440]   We pray for grace to cause us Lord God to think more deeply of who you are.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   That your word would have its effect in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.960]   We entrust this time to you asking for your blessing upon it.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   In Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.720]   Amen.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.220]   You know, one of the blessings of living in the United States as a Christian is whenever
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.720]   we travel or, you know, we spent so many years out in China trying to share the gospel with
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   Chinese students who grew up under the communist regime and they were never taught about Christianity.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.660]   There's some kind of religion and yet they practice Christmas.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.160]   So they have Christmas trees and gifts and stockings and Santa Claus and so they have
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.900]   all the decorations but they've never really been taught what these holidays mean.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.840]   So whenever we go, obviously it's illegal to outright share the gospel with them, especially
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.040]   to minors, but it's not very hard to share the gospel because all we have to do is share
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.140]   about American holidays.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.440]   And so we would teach about history and various things and about grammar but we would always
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.800]   make sure that we have one class at American holidays and obviously we would share about
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.140]   Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.520]   And so whenever we teach that, the gospel is going to come out, right?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.800]   And they say, "Hey, you're not supposed to share the gospel."
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.120]   I say, "Oh, we're just telling them what Christmas is about."
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.480]   They say, "You're not supposed to talk about the resurrection."
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.560]   I say, "Oh, we're just talking about Easter."
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   And so that's how we're able to share the gospel in all these years coming in and out
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   of China because it's embedded into this culture, the Judeo-Christian principles and things.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   Even though we may be moving away from it today, it's embedded into the culture.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.640]   And that's one of the benefits of being in a culture where even around us today, we have
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.880]   so many people practice Christmas, almost the whole world practices Christmas, not really
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   understanding the significance of what it is.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   And that's why we want to take advantage of that, that while we celebrate Christmas, it's
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.000]   easy to ask.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.440]   Sometimes it may be hard to ask, but do you want to hear about God?
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.360]   But when everybody's celebrating Christmas to say, "This is what Christmas means," right?
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.160]   And so the door kind of is open for us to be able to share the gospel.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.640]   The reason why I share that is because Christmas is probably the most, I don't know if you
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   want to call it important, but the most celebrated, that we make the biggest deal about Christmas.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.120]   You see it in decorations, commercials, everything that we do.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.860]   Our longest break, holiday break, is during the Christmas break.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.820]   The Jews also had something like Christmas in their culture.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.000]   And what they had was the Day of Atonement.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.240]   So Day of Atonement was their biggest holiday.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.760]   So they would have the Passover, and that Passover would bleed into the Passover through
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.040]   the Day of Atonement.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.960]   And so they would take sometimes weeks and weeks off, sometimes months off, in order
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   to travel to get to Jerusalem.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.320]   And so it was embedded into their culture so that every year they would share this with
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.280]   one another and remind each other of the significance of this.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.960]   So at the center of their culture, this Day of Atonement was embedded for a particular
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   reason.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.000]   So here in Hebrews 13, 10-11, it says, "We have an altar from which those who serve the
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.240]   tabernacle have no right to eat."
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.740]   Let me stop right there.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.720]   If you studied with us the book of Leviticus, that's where the priests actually got their
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.980]   food.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.020]   People would bring sacrifices, and they would take their livers and parts that they would
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.080]   normally not eat and take the meat part of it, and that portion belonged to the priest
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.160]   to eat.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.360]   So when he says, "We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.000]   to eat," it's specifically relating to the sacrifice of the Day of Atonement.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.760]   Because that offering, they were not allowed to eat.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.800]   Every other offering they were.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   So he's specifically referring to that.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.880]   And then verse 11, he said, "For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.480]   the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp."
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.440]   Again, any Jew who read that would right away understand he's referring to the sacrifice
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.880]   made on the Day of Atonement.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.720]   Most of you probably have heard the significance of this day, but I want to emphasize for you
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960]   just how important this day is.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   So if you can put up the chart for me, the next one.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.180]   So this is the chart of the tabernacle.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.220]   So right in there you have the rectangle, and that's the tabernacle.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.880]   So those of you who have bad eyes, that's what it says.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.600]   And then the 12 around that are the 12 tribes.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.440]   So those are the names of the tribes there.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.320]   If you read the book of Numbers, that's exactly how the tribe was organized.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.640]   So every time that they settle in, they are to be in that order.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.320]   And so the tabernacle was right at the center.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.360]   So whenever they moved, they would march like military, one tribe after the other.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.920]   And then when they would settle down, they would put the tabernacle and everybody would
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   settle.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.560]   So every time they settled in for any period of time and the tabernacle was established,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.720]   that's what the Israelites looked like in 40 years in the desert.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.200]   In the 40 years while they were in the desert, obviously God placed a tabernacle in the center
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.960]   for a reason, because everyone had equal access to the tabernacle.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.800]   So at the tabernacle, what was at the center of the tabernacle?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.520]   The sacrifices, right?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.360]   The whole purpose of the book of Leviticus was to give instructions on how to give sacrifices
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.680]   to be able to draw near to God.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.360]   In the sacrifices, what's at the center?
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.880]   Those of you who are studying with us in Leviticus, they have atonement.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.720]   So if you remember, as we studied through the book of Leviticus, Leviticus is designed,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.640]   is instructed to us in a chiastic format.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.560]   So some of you who are A students may remember that.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.400]   So if you can put up the chiastic structure, this is basically the outline of the book
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   of Leviticus.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.220]   Okay, and this is one of those books that a lot of Christians who've been Christians
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.760]   for many years still are very mystified by it because it's hard to understand.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.560]   But when you understand what God was doing in the book of Leviticus, it really is very,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.340]   very important in understanding what's happening in the New Testament.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.760]   He writes it in a chiastic form.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   So chiastic form basically means that it's kind of like the crescendo, right?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.120]   Those of you guys who are into music, which I am not, but I know enough about to know
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.120]   what a crescendo is.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   Crescendo is basically you're kind of, the music is playing and it's building up to a
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.360]   peak, right?
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.880]   And so that peak, you're supposed to, you'll normally hear the drums or the music getting
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.840]   a little bit louder, or if you're playing the guitar and at the peak of it, you get
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.560]   the cymbals go boom.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.240]   And that's the crescendo.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.640]   And so when you think of the music, when there's a crescendo in the music, you know, like that's
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.720]   kind of like the peak.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.840]   So the chiastic structure of a book is kind of like a crescendo.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.600]   So everything is building up to the center.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:30.160]   So the main point of the book of Leviticus crescendos at chapter 16 at the day of atonement.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.120]   And then after that, it kind of re-explains the different laws pointing back to the day
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.640]   of atonement, how this ought to be practiced.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.040]   Now why is this so important?
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.400]   Because at the center of Israel was the tabernacle.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.960]   And at the center of the tabernacle was the sacrifices.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   And at the center of the sacrifices was the day of atonement.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.640]   Now at the center of the day of atonement was the two sacrifices, the two goats that
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.180]   was offered up.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.600]   And one was offered up and the blood that the goat would shed, the high priest would
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.800]   take that, take it into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle the mercy seed, which he could
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.300]   only go in once a year, symbolizing that the blood of this goat is going to cover the mercy
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.540]   seed and atone for the sins of Israel where there was inaccess.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.520]   And all of this is role-playing so that we can understand that blood had to be shed for
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.080]   the purpose of access to God.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.800]   The second goat, where we call the scapegoat, where Aaron, the high priest, would put both
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.480]   hands on it, representing the sins of Israel, and take that goat outside the camp and remove
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   it far, far away.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.000]   They said over 10 miles away so that they could no longer see it and cast it outside
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   the camp.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.040]   So what it symbolized in the day of atonement was because of the sacrifice of this goat
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.900]   that sins of Israel is cast out of Israel.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.680]   So when the author of Hebrews says here, "We have an altar from which those who serve the
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.360]   tabernacle have no right to eat," the Israelites would have right away understood he's talking
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.560]   about the day of atonement.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.400]   What I just shared with you isn't just about the book of Leviticus.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:26.000]   What about these two goats, one sacrifice and the other goat being cast out of the camp
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.740]   is not only at the center of the tabernacle, it's not only at the center of the day of
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.480]   atonement, it's at the center of redemptive history.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.560]   All of this is to point to Christ in what He was going to do.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:49.040]   So as the day of atonement and the sacrifice crescendoed on that sacrifice, all of redemptive
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.360]   history crescendos in Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.280]   And then after that, everything in the Old Testament is the preparation for Christ coming
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.840]   in His death.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.640]   Everything after the Gospels is pointing back to the cross of what happened and the effects
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.120]   of that.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.520]   So all of this is being role-played to point to Christ.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.760]   And that's what He means by that those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   by high priests as an offering for sin and burned outside the camp, was taken outside
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.320]   the camp, and He says, "Therefore, Jesus also that He might sanctify people through His
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.080]   own blood suffered outside the camp."
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.760]   In other words, He's saying, "Jesus is the fulfillment of that act."
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.000]   That's what He's saying.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.560]   Everything that you've been learning about this was about Christ being taken outside
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   the camp.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   But you know what's interesting about this is that book crescendos and then it turns
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.160]   back, but the end of the book of Leviticus in chapter 26 ends with a warning of blessing
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.200]   and cursing, that if you obey, that here are the blessings that will come to you, and if
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.000]   you disobey and break the law, then here are the curses that will come to you.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.720]   But the interesting thing about this is there's about 13 verses that talk about God's blessing,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.840]   and there's over 50 some verses that talk about God's curse.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.080]   If you read through the book of Deuteronomy, you see the similar breakdown where you'll
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.200]   see a couple chapters about God's blessing and many, many chapters about God's curses.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.060]   It's almost like God already knew where they were headed, because everything that He's
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.040]   doing with the nation of Israel, it says it is a shadow of the reality to come.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.880]   And so we already know that God gave them the law for what purpose?
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.320]   So that they can obey and have life?
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   No.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.760]   He said God gave the law so that you may understand sin to be utterly sinful.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:01.320]   So everything that He's doing here is kind of a role-playing so that when Christ comes,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.360]   that people would understand the curse that they're under.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.920]   And Israel's whole history is to demonstrate that so that it can point to the reality in
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.580]   Christ.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.660]   So what I want to do this morning is look at the text that He's referring to, look at
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:25.280]   the blessings that He desires for us, and the curse He says that we're going to be under.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   In Leviticus chapter 26, verses 1 to 13, and it summarizes in three ways.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.280]   One, God will provide a rain in their season so that they will bear much fruit.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.960]   Two, verse 6 through 8, God will give them peace in the land.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.200]   And then three, verse 9 and 10, God will grant them to be fruitful and to multiply because
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   He will walk among them.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.200]   When you summarize the three points of God's blessing, what does it sound like?
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Think for a second.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.800]   Critical thinking for a minute.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.880]   What does those blessings sound like?
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.920]   You're going to be fruitful, you're going to multiply, right?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.160]   And the Lord is going to be among you.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.680]   Sounds like the Garden of Eden, right?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   That was God's intent.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:16.160]   He said, when you are obedient and God blesses you and His presence is among you, that everything
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.720]   you do, you're going to be fruitful, you're going to multiply because the Lord is with
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.120]   you.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.440]   But then He turns immediately to verse 14 to 39 and He warns them, but if you do not
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.000]   obey, the curse of God will be upon you.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.600]   In verse 14 and 16, it says this, but if you do not obey me and do not carry out all these
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.480]   commandments, if instead you reject my statutes and if your soul abhors my ordinances so as
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.260]   not to carry out all my commandments and so break my covenant, I in turn will do this
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.360]   to you.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.400]   Now I want to emphasize here that each one of these warnings, these curses, emphasizes
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.720]   God saying, I will do this to you.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.320]   You know, again, we're in a culture where we want to minimize God's culpability to His
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.000]   punishment so He created heaven, but we kind of minimize hell.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.380]   God blesses and He shows grace, but in kind of like judgment, it kind of just happens.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.920]   So God's judgment is Him just not blessing you.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   That's not what it says.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   He said, I will bless you if you obey my commandment, but He says, I will curse you if you disobey.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.600]   So I want you to notice that there's five separate phases of God's curse in chapter
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.040]   26 and each one of these curses, He emphasizes, I will do this.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.880]   So the first phase comes in verse 16 and 17 and He says, I in turn will do this to you.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.360]   I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.720]   cause the soul to pine away.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.880]   So you will sow your seed uselessly for your enemies will eat it up.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:07.120]   I will set my face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies and
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.760]   those who hate you will rule over you and you will flee when no one is pursuing you.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.320]   I think this section can be summarized by God disturbing their peace.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.360]   The shalom is broken.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.280]   The Sabbath is broken.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.400]   And that's exactly what the Bible says.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:30.240]   As soon as Adam and Eve rebelled against God, the Sabbath that God took them into was broken.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.480]   So from that day on, mankind is walking around.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.240]   We buy homes.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:42.580]   We put money away in our bank accounts, all of it in order so that we may have some peace.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.660]   We look for jobs.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.480]   We pursue, we fight, we struggle.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.640]   And at the core of it, we're trying to reestablish a Sabbath that was broken.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.760]   But God says when you disobey, your peace doesn't come from living in a peaceful country
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.840]   or not being in war or having a nice home to stay.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.460]   He said the peace is disturbed because of sin.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.600]   Because true peace is only found in Christ and when he's there.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.840]   So when he says, I will take away my presence, he said even when the enemy is not pursuing
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.200]   you, you will flee.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.320]   Because your peace has been disturbed.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.420]   And he said that's the first thing that will happen.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.520]   No sense of security.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.860]   There's always sense of anxiety.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.960]   Even when there is no turmoil, there is a sense that something's going to happen.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.640]   So when you're rich, you're afraid that you're going to lose your money.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.680]   And if you don't have money, you're afraid that you're not going to get it.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.940]   And so no matter what financial situation you're in, there's never any peace because
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.920]   true peace can only be found in the presence of Christ.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.120]   And so he says, when you rebel against me and the curse comes upon you, peace will be
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   disturbed.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.200]   But secondly, verse 18 to 20, he says, but when that happens and you don't recognize
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.280]   that and you don't repent, you don't turn to me, he says in verse 18, I will, if they
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.960]   do not turn from their sins and after the first set of judgment, the punishment will
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.840]   increase sevenfold.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.600]   So it's not level one and level two.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.800]   He says, no, I've given you opportunity, but I really want you to know how serious this
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   curse is.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.840]   And he says it will increase it sevenfold.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.640]   And then he says, verse 19 and 20, he says, I will break down your pride of power.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.080]   I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.680]   What he means by that, he's going to dry up the sky and the ground is not going to bear
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   any fruit.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.840]   So there's going to be famine in the land.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.800]   Your strength will be spent uselessly for your land will not yield its produce and the
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.480]   trees of the land will not yield their fruit.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.940]   Do you remember in Genesis chapter three, when God brings curse upon mankind, he says
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:52.520]   to Adam that you will work the ground by the sweat of your brow and all it's going to produce
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.640]   is thorns and thistles.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.480]   And after that, you will go back to the ground and you will die.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.280]   So he's describing exactly the warning that he gave and said, this is going to happen.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.480]   He said, this is going to be fulfilled.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.900]   You're going to labor all your life and you're going to feel like you're not making any progress.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.120]   And he said, it wasn't simply because you made the wrong decision.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.360]   It wasn't simply because you didn't buy the right stock.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.420]   He said, it's because you rebelled against me.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.060]   And then he says the third one, verse 21 to 22, if you still will not repent, he says
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.180]   in verse 21, I will increase this judgment, these plagues sevenfold according to your
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   sins.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:36.140]   Verse 22, I will let loose among you beasts of the field, which will bereave you of your
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.220]   children and destroy your cattle and reduce your numbers so that your roads lie deserted.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.980]   Do you remember at the Garden of Eden, what Adam and Eve was doing?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.580]   He said they were laboring and the animals would come to them and he would name these
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.740]   animals.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.780]   So not only were they living in peace, Adam and Eve were ruling over the animals because
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.580]   God told them to, to be fruitful, to subdue the land.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:08.300]   Instead, these very creatures that God created for our enjoyment in creation will turn against
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.740]   you, he says, and they will reduce the number of people.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.380]   They will attack you.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.220]   The very creation that God created for his glory is going to turn against you.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.500]   Fourthly, verse 23 to 26 is after all of this, you still will not repent.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.220]   He says, God will act with hostility against them and will strike them sevenfold for their
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.220]   sins.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:35.100]   Verse 25 to 26, I will also bring upon you a sword, which will execute vengeance for
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.340]   your covenant.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.300]   And when you gather together in your cities, I will send pestilence among you so that you
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.680]   shall be delivered into enemy hands.
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.180]   When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven and they
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.580]   will bring back your bread in rationed amounts so that you will eat and not be satisfied.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.200]   He said he's going to, if after all of that, you don't recognize that this is a judgment
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   coming from God.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.380]   He said, I will bring upon you pestilence.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.920]   I will bring upon you a pandemic.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.860]   And in that, it's going to lead to financial ruin where you're not going to be able to
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.980]   find bread to eat.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.900]   He said, but even after that, you don't recognize the curse that you're in.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.780]   He says in 27 to 39, he said if the previous judgment does not bring them to repentance
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.260]   and God will act wrathfully and will punish them sevenfold.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.980]   So seven times seven times seven times seven times seven.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.920]   He says, I will bring it in order for you to repent.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.620]   And then verse 29, he says further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.500]   your daughters you will eat.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.640]   That's like unbelievable.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:22:00.300]   People of God who saw miracles with their own hands, who crossed over the Red Sea, who've
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.660]   eaten miraculous bread and quail.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.580]   They've seen the 10 plagues, the God conquering the enemies, that they are going to degenerate
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.660]   to the point where they're going to practice cannibalism to their own children.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.040]   It's unbelievable that they would fall this far.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.260]   If you read anything about the Old Testament, you know that this actually happened in Israel's
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.900]   history.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.580]   This actually happened in Israel's history, exactly as God said.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.540]   Further on he says, anyone who's left in verse 39, so those of you who may be left will rot
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.100]   away because of their iniquity in the lands of the enemies and also because of the iniquities
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:42.380]   of their forefathers, they will rot away with them.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:49.420]   As horrendous as this thing is, does this remind you of anything else in the scripture?
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.820]   Judgment sevenfold, sevenfold, sevenfold, sevenfold.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.660]   Yeah, book of Revelation.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   Book of Revelation tells us that the judgment starts with seven seals.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.060]   At the end of that, there's going to be seven trumpet judgments.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.300]   After that, there's going to be seven bowl judgments.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:15.820]   Every judgment is increasing in manner year after year after year after year.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.720]   All that he is warning them to the nation of Israel, all that has happened to the nation
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:27.300]   of Israel, all was a shadow, shadow of the reality that's coming at the end.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:34.320]   So if you obey and repent, this will happen, but if you do not, here's what's coming.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:41.740]   But if you notice, every one of these warnings ultimately is to bring them to repentance.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.680]   If after you've seen this and you do not repent, if after the suffering you do not repent,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.600]   if after you experience hardship, you do not repent, after you've gone all that and you
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.560]   still will not repent, the true judgment doesn't come with warning.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.360]   It just happens.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.640]   The white throne judgment comes, and there's not a lot of talk after that because it's
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.300]   over.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.160]   Because either you're in heaven or hell at that point.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:11.700]   And so all of this is role-playing for the gospel that we are preaching today.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:17.240]   In Galatians chapter 3, 10 through 13, Apostle Paul summarizes all of this, and he says this,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.060]   "For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.980]   For it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.700]   book of the law to perform them.'
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.540]   Now that no one is justified by the law before God is evident, for the righteous man shall
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.540]   live by faith.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.820]   However, the law is not of faith.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.420]   On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them."
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:44.860]   And then verse 13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.740]   for us.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.060]   For it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.'"
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:56.860]   All that drama of the sacrifices, all that drama of the Day of Atonement, every single
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:03.380]   year sacrificing that goat and then allowing that scapegoat to go, all of it was to point
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:10.540]   to what Christ was going to do on the cross, that He became the curse for us so that we
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.320]   might become the righteousness of God.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.420]   And that's what He means in Isaiah 53 in the Old Testament, speaking about their Messiah,
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:26.500]   He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.640]   And like one from whom men hide their face, He was despised and we did not esteem Him.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:40.700]   Surely our griefs He Himself bore, our sorrows He carried, our curse He carried.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:49.180]   Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:56.080]   Years ago, before my father passed away, he had a heart attack.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.900]   And so we took him to a hospital in Corona and he was there probably about 10 days recovering.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.260]   And so we were bringing him back home and I happened to live in Corona at that time.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:11.580]   And so we had a nice backyard, so we kind of let my dad rest there in front of the pool,
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.700]   just enjoying and just relaxing before he can go home.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.340]   And so by that time, you know, our children were very young.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:21.060]   So my oldest was probably no more than four, at most five years old, and they didn't know
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.220]   how to swim yet.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:29.060]   And so after we were resting, we all went inside to eat and only Jeremy, my oldest,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:35.460]   my father was sitting outside and as we're inside, we hear this large splash.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.660]   And we knew it wasn't Jeremy because it was a pretty large splash.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.660]   And then we all in shock went out thinking something bad happened.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:50.420]   And we got out just in time to see my dad in the pool, pulling Jeremy out of the water.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.180]   And again, he had a heart attack and he was coming, he was just resting in our home and
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.660]   he was soaking wet.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.020]   And so we saw him grab him from the back of his shirt and just pulling him out of the
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.140]   water.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.140]   So obviously we're all shocked.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.700]   And if my dad wasn't sitting there, Jeremy would have drowned.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.140]   He said, my dad just turned his head.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.340]   He said he was in the water just floating like this and didn't know what to do.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.140]   So he would have drowned.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.300]   So we're all in shock.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.300]   You know, it's like, oh my gosh, you know, is Jeremy okay?
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.580]   Oh my gosh, is my dad okay?
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.340]   And we're trying to take care of them.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.220]   Jeremy comes out of the water and shakes off the water.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.500]   He turns around and says, thanks, Harabuji.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.100]   And he just walks in.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.540]   He had no idea what happened.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.540]   He almost died.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:37.320]   If Harabuji wasn't sitting there, he would have drowned because we're all inside.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.380]   And all he knew is, thanks, Harabuji.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.020]   And he just walked inside, just changed his clothes, went out playing and ate and ran
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.020]   with the other kids.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.620]   And to this day, like we freaked out because of that.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.100]   So we started locking our doors and we made sure none of our kids went out.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.140]   And they said, we're never going to buy a house with a swimming pool again, you know,
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.420]   because we were so shocked by that.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.700]   We were traumatized by that experience.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.700]   But Jeremy is like, thanks, Harabuji.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.320]   Now because he was young, he was a kid, he didn't know what just happened.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.500]   And to this day, he doesn't have any traumatic experiences.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.620]   You know, I asked him after the first service, do you remember that?
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.780]   He's like, oh yeah.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.780]   You know, you almost died.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.580]   He's like, yeah.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.820]   Because it wasn't traumatic for him.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.820]   He just got a lot of attention that day.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.820]   You know.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.980]   The reason why I share this is because what is the purpose of the crescendo?
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.460]   Is to bring attention to the peak.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.740]   See, everything that God has been doing was to prepare for what he was doing at the cross
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.060]   so that we don't just come along and say, you know, God loves you, has a wonderful plan
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.380]   for your life and he died.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.380]   Oh, okay.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.380]   Thank you.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   Part of the reason why the sacrifice of Christ and him taking the curse upon himself is because
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:06.220]   we don't fully understand the curse that we are under without Christ.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.900]   Everything that he mentions there about lacking peace, working hard, and everything turning
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:21.060]   into thorns and thistles, enemies coming after us, pestilence coming, fear of death, meaninglessness.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:27.940]   All of this is a description of mankind outside of Christ that you and I deserved.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:34.020]   And he played this drama out in the nation of Israel year after year after year, animal
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:39.580]   after animal after animal, so that it would be so saturated in their psyche that when
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:46.820]   Christ came that they understood that he came to take away that from me.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.220]   So that at his death there would be celebration and praise.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.860]   But because the nation of Israel did not understand, they praised him going to the cross, but they
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:02.700]   abandoned him when he was at the cross because they did not understand what was happening.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.020]   But the question is, do you understand?
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:13.100]   Do we understand that everything that was written here was ultimately for us?
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:19.340]   So that we would respond to him by saying, "Hallelujah!
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.060]   Thank you for saving me!"
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.440]   Do you remember?
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.100]   Do you remember what it was like before you knew Christ?
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.860]   Have you forgotten?
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.060]   Maybe some of you just kind of grew up in the church and maybe there's a deep memory,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:44.540]   but I think most of us have some recollection what it was like when you didn't know Jesus.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.140]   How desperate you were.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.860]   How lonely you were.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.140]   How hurt you were.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.340]   How bitter you were.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.380]   How angry you were.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.260]   Maybe some of us have forgotten what it is that we have been saved from and what it is
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.380]   that we have been saved to.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.940]   And that's the whole point of what he's been trying all, saying all this time.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.060]   Why would you go back to the old system when all of that was to prepare you to bring you
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.620]   to Christ?
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:24.240]   All of Hebrew is to prepare for this passage so that you and I can understand and celebrate
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   and to worship.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.660]   That's what he means when he says, "Live up to the gospel that's been given to you.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.140]   Don't ever forget.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.140]   Don't ever forget."
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.460]   That's why he says, because Christ has done this and he took the curse that you and I
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:45.740]   deserved, he says in verse 13 and 14, "So let us go out to him outside the camp, bearing
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.500]   his reproach.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.800]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come."
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:32:00.640]   As Christ came outside the camp, he turned what ought to have been a curse into the greatest
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.300]   blessing of mankind.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.500]   He took what anybody, every time in the Old Testament when it says he was taken outside
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.300]   the camp, that was the ultimate judgment to any Israelite.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.940]   You can be reprimanded, you can be disciplined for a period, but once they go outside the
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.340]   camp, there's no hope.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.180]   So every time, only the harshest punishments were given outside the camp.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.980]   And it was not by accident that Jesus was dragged outside of camp at Golgotha.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:41.020]   And he says as he was crucified, as he took on the curse, as he took on our sins, he reverses
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.900]   this curse at the cross and he turns it into a blessing.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.340]   Drinking the blood and eating the flesh, as Jesus says in John chapter 16, would have
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:57.860]   been the most sacrilegious thing that a Jewish rabbi would ask of his disciples.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.620]   And yet he says if you do not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you have no relationship
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.620]   with me.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:10.440]   So he took one of the most sacrilegious things and turned it into a place of life.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.060]   He says he who seeks to be the greatest in the kingdom of God will be the least.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:20.620]   Think about how much we're trying so hard to get ahead in life, to buy a better house,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.420]   to have better vacations, and we get trapped in this rat race and Jesus comes in and he
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.980]   turns this rat race upside down.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.220]   And he who tries to be the greatest will be the least, and he who is the least will be
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.880]   the greatest in the kingdom of God.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.180]   We try so hard to live and make something of ourselves and he says he who finds his
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   life will lose it.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.220]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:54.140]   Only Christ has that power to change the curse of man into the blessing of God.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:01.140]   Those of you guys who are old enough remember the disaster that happened in Chernobyl reactor.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.740]   Some of you guys may have read about it, some of you guys lived through it.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.580]   Not that you were there, but you're old enough to remember when that happened.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:16.300]   In 1986, April 26, one of the reactors blew up and all kinds of radiation leaked out of
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.580]   this nuclear reactor.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:24.580]   And out of that, over 31 people died directly, and since then they have counted, they believe
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:30.140]   it's much more than this, but they said that over 20,000 people contracted cancer as a
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.900]   direct result of this leak.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:38.300]   Over 40 years later, they're still afraid, they don't know how long this effect's going
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:44.100]   to be, but to this day, they're not going to plant there because they don't know how
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.100]   much radiation is still stuck on the ground because it didn't just affect the air, it
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.900]   affected the building, it affected the cattle, it affected the roads, it affected the plants,
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.200]   it affected everything.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.980]   So even 40 years later, you would be out of your mind to buy property there, but if you
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   see pictures of Chernobyl, they've been trying hard.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.700]   They rebuilt the infrastructure, they rebuilt the buildings, they're trying to get people
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.540]   to come back, and the property is cheap.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.820]   You can understand why it would be so cheap, but they can't get people to come back.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.220]   Nobody in their right mind, unless they were born into that, no one's going to move to
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.900]   Chernobyl.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:30.020]   Only missionaries would go a place like that to bring the gospel.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.380]   We can understand why people would not move there.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:41.060]   We can understand why people would not invest there, because it's been affected by radiation.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:47.680]   When he says, "Christ went outside the camp to reverse this curse," and he invites us
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:54.800]   all to come outside the camp, he's basically telling us all of creation is under the condemnation
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   of this sin.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.100]   It's under a curse.
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.900]   So why would you invest and build and place your hope, no matter how cheap the property
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.900]   is?
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.380]   Because all of this is condemned.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.260]   That's exactly what it says in Romans 8, 20 to 24, "For the creation was subjected to
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:17.580]   futility not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.500]   itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption into the freedom of the glory
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.540]   of the children of God."
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.900]   All of creation has been directly affected by the sin of mankind.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:34.180]   And he said, "God will restore it when man is restored."
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.820]   And that's why he says, "Come out.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.820]   Come out."
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.940]   If you recognize the curse of mankind, he said, "Come out."
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.420]   Because the place that you envy, the place that you covet, the place that you are putting
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:54.620]   your hope in, has been condemned until he restores it when he comes back.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.900]   So in other words, invest in eternity.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.820]   Come out.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:08.020]   How much of our struggle and anxiety, marriage problems, relational issues, are directly
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.660]   linked to us coveting this condemned world?
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.620]   See, the Israelites, they prided themselves of Jerusalem.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.900]   This is the city of God.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.940]   This is where the Messiah is going to come.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.620]   And that's why they were celebrating, "Hosanna, Hosanna," when Christ came.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.980]   Because they thought he was going to reconquer Jerusalem in the name of God, and they were
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.860]   going to be the top dog.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:41.740]   And when Jesus gave himself up, they could not understand.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.580]   Why would you do that?
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.740]   You're finally going to answer our prayers.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.780]   Finally we're going to be on the top.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.060]   And Jesus becomes a servant to the point of death.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:58.740]   They did not understand that our real sin, our real problem, was not the economy, was
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:04.100]   not the Roman government, but it's ourselves.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.820]   We have been corrupted by our own sins.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.380]   And the only answer to that is Christ crucified.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.700]   That's why he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 19, he says, "If we have hoped in Christ in this
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:28.740]   life only, we are all meant most to be pitied, to come out, to come out."
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.940]   Even if you work hard, make the right investments, put away enough money, and you become wildly
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:43.580]   successful and you become the top dog, we become the top dog on a dong hill that has
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.780]   been condemned.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.300]   The reason why I think some of us don't get affected by this is either we have been so
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:39:00.060]   saturated with temptation of this world, and it's become so mundane that it's hard for
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:06.420]   us to muster up any emotions because we've become so inoculated by the truth that we
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.380]   profess to believe.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:17.460]   Or we don't really believe this, and we're trying to pretend like we believe it.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:22.980]   So we're trying to pretend and go through the motions.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.180]   But if you really believe this, how can this not affect you?
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:35.300]   How can we be so concerned about making it in this world?
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:45.140]   How can we be so concerned about building on land that is contaminated by radiation?
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.460]   Come out.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.100]   Come out.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.980]   Come to Christ.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.660]   Find His refuge in Him.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:57.380]   Embrace the Christ who reversed this curse.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:03.820]   In Hebrews 11, 13-16, it says, "All these men and women of faith have died without receiving
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.740]   the promise, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance and having confessed
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.820]   that they were strangers and exiles on the earth, for those who say such things make
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.580]   it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:21.020]   And indeed, if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.460]   have had opportunity to return.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.780]   But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.580]   Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.260]   them."
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:46.580]   Let's live consistent with what we profess, because the whole world sees it.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:53.180]   You know, when we live in hypocrisy, everybody else notices first before we do.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:59.420]   We sing songs, memorize scripture, we celebrate, we tell people to come to church, but non-Christians
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.320]   see right through our hypocrisy.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.420]   You don't really believe what you're trying to tell me.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.700]   Because if you're telling me to come outside the camp, why are you in the camp?
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:16.200]   If you believe that blessing is outside the camp, why are you fighting so hard to make
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.100]   it inside the camp?
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   To come out.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.500]   To come out.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.660]   Our refuge is with Him.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.580]   Our life is with Him.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.100]   Our life is now hidden with Christ.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.860]   But when He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:40.840]   So during this Christmas season, let's redeem what God has implanted in our culture.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.620]   Let's redeem this opportunity so when people ask us, "Why do you celebrate Christmas?"
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.660]   that we can tell them the hope that we have in Christ.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.660]   Yes, we'll buy gifts, we'll celebrate, we'll get together with our brothers and sisters
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.660]   and family members.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:42:00.260]   But in the midst of all of that, let's not forget why we celebrate.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:07.780]   Christ came, He who knew no sin, became sin for us so that you and I may become the righteousness
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.780]   of God.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:15.080]   And let's have every part of that make an impact in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.880]   If you would take a minute to pray with me.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:32.740]   Again, as our worship team leads us, if I can ask you to take a minute to surrender
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:39.040]   your life to Christ, what have you coveted in your heart that's squeezing out and quenching
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.440]   the Holy Spirit?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.180]   Coveting isn't just about material things.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.520]   You can covet other people's affections.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.820]   You can covet your leisure time.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.420]   You can covet material things.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.220]   You can covet other families.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.600]   You can covet the past.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.500]   You can covet the future.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   But when coveting takes hold of our hearts, it squeezes out the powerful work of Christ.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.420]   So let's come before the Lord and surrender.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:22.600]   If we really believe that Christ is life, does our life reflect our confession?
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.580]   So let's take some time to pray and to reflect and to surrender as our worship team leads
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.580]   us.
