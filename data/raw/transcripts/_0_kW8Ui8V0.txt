[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.820]   Before I begin, again, I wanna say happy birthday to Emiko,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   who's all the way over there in Japan,
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.820]   and she's the only birthday this week.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   So again, happy birthday.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.820]   First of all, our membership class is starting on July 5th.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   That's next Sunday up in the cafe area.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   Again, just a reminder that this is not our typical
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   BCC class that we had all these years.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.820]   This is separated from the seeker class
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.820]   to strictly membership class.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   So those who are interested in becoming members in the church,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   this is an eight-week course from 9 a.m. to 10.30 a.m.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.820]   So it'll finish in time for you to attend the 10.30 service.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.820]   So if you are going there,
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   that'll start at 9 a.m. upstairs at the cafe.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   Then also for the parents, there's going to be a virtual VBS.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   So obviously, for obvious reasons,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   we're not gonna be having a physical VBS.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.820]   A virtual VBS will be taking place July 27th through the 31st.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   We don't have the exact time,
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   but most likely it will be in the evening time.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820]   So if you sign up for that, for those period,
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.820]   for two to three hours, there's going to be teaching,
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.820]   kind of running like a normal VBS.
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   So if you are planning to do that, please sign up.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.820]   I think Pastor Mark or I think Jane is in charge, right?
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.820]   But anyway, right now we don't have the information,
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   so if you can contact Pastor Mark,
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   and he'll direct you to the right place.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   And if you're willing to help out with that,
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   whether it's skits or whatever it is that they're doing,
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820]   please contact Jane.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.820]   Actually, her email is right here, okay, for me.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   Jane's email, so if you can do that.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.820]   Or again, if you don't have access to that,
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   please email Pastor Mark.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.820]   Okay, and I think that's it for today, right?
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.820]   Okay, again, if you are planning to give the offering,
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   please do it electronically, and then if not,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   our physical offering is in the back.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.820]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   Dear God, we thank you for this morning.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.820]   We thank you for the opportunity and the privilege that we have
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   to be able to come and give you worship.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   You deserve, Lord God.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.820]   I pray that no matter what distractions we may have brought into this room,
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   cause us to be focused, completely given to you,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.820]   especially now, Lord God, where there are storms all around us.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.820]   Help us to be anchored in Christ.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.820]   Help us, Lord God, that your word is not just something we hear on Sunday morning,
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.820]   but that it would cause us to think and that we would not be conformed to the
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind,
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   according to your word.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.820]   And so now, as we give our offering, help us to give intentionally,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.820]   faithfully, joyfully, Lord God,
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820]   that it may be multiplied for your kingdom's use.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.820]   Amen.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:20.820]   I will trust my Savior Jesus when my darkest hours befall.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   Trust Him when to simply trust Him
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.820]   seems the hardest thing of all.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.820]   I will trust my Savior Jesus.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.820]   Trust Him when my strength is small.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   For I know the shield of Jesus is the safest place of all.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:10.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:20.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.820]   I will trust.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.820]   I will trust my Savior Jesus.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.820]   He has set His way His best.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:40.820]   And I know the path He's chosen leads to everlasting rest.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.820]   Jesus.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:52.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:23:00.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.820]   Jesus.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:12.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:20.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.820]   [MUSIC - "I WILL TRUST MY SAVIOR JESUS"]
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:53.820]   Oh, on that cross, how it was seen.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   I can go on now, ever trusting in the one who died for me.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.820]   What could I bring?
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.820]   For your gift is complete.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:22.820]   So I trust you, simply trust you, Lord, with every part of me.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   Oh, on that cross.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:32.820]   Oh, on that cross, how it was seen.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:43.820]   I can go now, ever trusting in the one who died for me.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.820]   What could I bring?
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.820]   For your gift is complete.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:25:03.820]   So I trust you, simply trust you, Lord, with every part of me.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.820]   Jesus.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:15.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:24.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.820]   Jesus.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:36.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, help me trust you more and more.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:45.820]   Jesus, only Jesus, may my heart be ever yours.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   All right, may we be seated?
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 8.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.820]   We're going to continue our studies in the priesthood of Christ.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:10.820]   Hebrews chapter 8, verses 1 through 8.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:19.820]   Hebrews chapter 8, verses 1 through 8, reading out of the book of Hebrews, NASB.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.820]   Now the main point in what has been said is this.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:41.820]   [Reading]
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:48.820]   Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law,
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:55.820]   who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.820]   For see, he says, that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.820]   which he has enacted on better promises. Let's pray.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.820]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your anointing.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to continue to guide and lead us,
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   and your word, Lord God, would cause us to be anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.820]   If our hearts and our mind, Lord, has been distracted in anything else but you,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.820]   we pray, Father, that this morning you would teach us,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.820]   that we may hear from you, and that we may follow your Son and your Son alone.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:51.820]   You know, as we study the Bible, one of the most important things in understanding what the Bible says is what?
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   Context, right?
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.820]   You have to understand everything in context.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   So you have to understand the verse in the context of the passage.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.820]   And you have to understand the passage in the context of the letter.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:11.820]   And you have to understand the letter in the context of the covenant, the New Testament or the Old Testament.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.820]   And you have to understand everything in the context of the redemptive history,
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.820]   meaning the meta-narrative, the large narrative that God is giving.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.820]   So when we study the details, obviously we're studying the author, we're studying the recipients,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.820]   we're studying the culture behind it.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.820]   But at the same time, there is a larger picture that we have to learn how to connect to,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.820]   which we call the meta-narrative.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.820]   And if we don't connect it, we don't know how it belongs to God's redemptive history,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:44.820]   you're going to miss the whole point, because the true author of the Bible is the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.820]   There's only one author.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.820]   Even though he used different people at different times to deal with certain specific things,
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:56.820]   the Bible was never meant to be read in sections.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.820]   The sections need to be understood in the context of the larger book, the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   because they are cohesive.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   Now the reason why I say that, without understanding the meta-narrative,
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   the book of Jonah becomes a story about a man who decides not to obey God,
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.820]   and then he gets swallowed up by a whale.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.820]   And so don't mess with God.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.820]   The whale is going to come and get you.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.820]   The end.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.820]   The book of Hosea is about how we need to be gracious to prostitutes.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.820]   Gomer is going to keep prostituting herself, but we should love people like we love prostitutes.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.820]   The end.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.820]   If we don't understand how this fits into the larger narrative.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.820]   The book of Jonah was written as a rebuke to the nation of Israel,
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.820]   in the context of God calling the nation of Israel to be a blessing to the rest of the nation.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.820]   His intent was always, in Genesis chapter 12, to bless them,
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.820]   and that they would be a blessing to the rest of the world.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.820]   So God's purpose was the world, always the world.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.820]   But by the time of Jonah being written, they didn't care about the rest of the world,
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.820]   only about themselves.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   And that's why the letter ends with rebuke to Jonah.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.820]   What is it to you that I show mercy to these people?
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.820]   The end. That's how it ends.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.820]   So if you don't connect that to the meta-narrative,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.820]   it just becomes a good story to tell in Sunday school about don't mess with God.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.820]   Or stay away from whales if you're disobedient.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.820]   Or something to that effect.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.820]   The book of Hosea is, again, a rebuke to the nation of Israel.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.820]   The way that God calls Hosea to love this prostitute, Gomer,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.820]   is the way that God continues to love the nation of Israel and God's people.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.820]   And he's warning them, at some point, this grace is going to run out,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.820]   so you need to repent.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.820]   So he's trying to bring them back to repentance.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.820]   Now I say all of this is because not only the book of Jonah or Hosea,
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.820]   every part of Scripture we have to keep asking, what is the main point?
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.820]   We've been studying the Melchizedek, the priesthood of Jesus,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.820]   of Melchizedek, which Jesus came under.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.820]   We started that in chapter 6.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.820]   We took a long break and then we picked it back up in chapter 7.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.820]   We're right in the middle of things.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.820]   He's going to lead to a better ministry, better covenant,
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.820]   and then we're going to get into chapter 9, the old and the new covenant.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.820]   And so we're going to be on this subject,
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.820]   even if we don't mention Melchizedek every single Sunday.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   We're going to be on this subject for a while.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   But the goal of this study isn't simply so that you can say,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.820]   you know what, Melchizedek is hard to understand,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   but good thing we went through it.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.820]   We're going to get some knowledge about who he is.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.820]   That's not the point.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.820]   If that's your point, you missed the whole point.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   In fact, anybody who studied the book of Hebrews may be eager to jump to chapter 11
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   or chapter 12.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.820]   Tell me what to do.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.820]   What is it that we're supposed to do?
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.820]   Chapter 7, 8, and 9 is the core of the book of Hebrews
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.820]   because if you don't fully grasp who Jesus is,
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.820]   whatever it is that you do is going to be founded upon whatever you think he is,
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.820]   not who he is.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.820]   And that's the common mistake that churches make.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:15.820]   When we get riled up into action without having a good foundation of who Jesus is
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.820]   and what he calls us to do, we can be well-meaning and give all our efforts
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:25.820]   and pour all our energy into things that in the end may have nothing to do with God.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   So we need to make sure that we are completely anchored in Christ,
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.820]   that no matter what it is that we endeavor to do,
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.820]   that it is because this is what Christ would do.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.820]   This is what Christ calls us to do.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:45.820]   So to make it easy, chapter 8 actually begins by telling us now the main point.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.820]   This is the main point.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   Sometimes you study the Bible and you really have to search for it
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.820]   because the main point is kind of scattered everywhere.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.820]   And after you study, you say, "Oh, this is the main point."
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   Well, he makes it easy for us.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   Verse 1, he says, "Now the main point in what has been said is this."
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.820]   So what he has to say, basically we need to pay attention
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.820]   because he says this is the main point.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.820]   This is the reason what we've been studying.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.820]   This is what he wants us to get, the main point.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.820]   And so the next phrase that comes really is a summary of what he's going to say
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.820]   in the next four or five verses.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.820]   So there's three things he says.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.820]   The main point is this.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:31.820]   We have such a high priest, meaning Christ, who has taken his seat, number one.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.820]   And so we're going to be talking about what does that mean for him to take his seat.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.820]   Second, he's taken his seat at the right hand of the throne.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.820]   What does it mean for his seat to be at the right hand?
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:49.820]   And then third, that this throne is the majesty in heaven.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.820]   So that kind of summarizes everything that he really wants to say.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.820]   And then the conclusion of that, because this is who he is
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.820]   and this is what he has done, he concludes in verse 6 by saying,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.820]   "But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.820]   by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant,
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.820]   which has been enacted on better promises."
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.820]   That's his point.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.820]   Because remember, he's talking to a group of people
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.820]   who are drifting back into their old system, the Judaistic system,
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.820]   because it was easier and it was much more tangible.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   That's what their friends were in.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:30.820]   So in order to avoid hardship in life, they were trying to blend the old life
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.820]   and the new life.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.820]   And so the point of all of this is you either don't understand who Christ is
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:44.820]   or you've drifted so far that you've forgotten.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.820]   Whatever the case is and whatever the reason you have drifted,
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.820]   it is important for us to be re-anchored in Christ.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.820]   And it's no different today.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   I think either there are people in the church who really don't care.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.820]   Just tell me that I believe Jesus and I'm going to go to heaven
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.820]   and everything in between really doesn't matter
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.820]   because all I really want from Christ is to go to heaven, not to go to hell.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   That's it.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   And there's a lot of people in the church who really believe very little,
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.820]   if any, of Christ, and it is enough that they've been baptized
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.820]   and that they're going to go to heaven.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.820]   And everything in between is just not that important.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.820]   They'll never say it because in the church culture you'll be rebuked for that.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   But in everything in their life, every thought, what they're interested in,
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.820]   what makes them happy, what they get excited about,
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.820]   really has nothing to do with Christ.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.820]   It's just a barrier.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.820]   It's just a minimum thing that I need to do so that I can feel safe
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   about not going to hell.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.820]   And we may find that at the end of all of this
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.820]   that they never had faith to begin with.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.820]   And then there are Christians who genuinely are just entangled with things in life
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.820]   and they are constantly just being tempted back and forth.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.820]   And all the more why we need to constantly focus our attention on Christ
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   so that we may be anchored.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   Or we have such a superficial understanding of the Savior that we sing about,
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.820]   that we say is the most important thing in our life,
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.820]   but we never invest any time really searching, really knowing.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   And it is enough to read little articles and hear sermons once a week,
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   and that's enough.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.820]   And as a result of that, as a superficial understanding of who Christ is,
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   it's caused me to be superficially anchored in Christ.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.820]   So whenever there is a wind of doctrine, any cultural change,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.820]   anything that's going on around us, we get tossed back and forth, back and forth
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.820]   because we're not anchored in Christ.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.820]   And all the more we need to be anchored in Christ.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   So let's begin.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.820]   If this is the main point of all things, and we have such a high priest,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.820]   the first thing that he says is he has taken his seat.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.820]   Again, if you understand that without context,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.820]   say, "What's the big deal? You're sitting down, so Jesus is sitting down.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.820]   I was sitting down and I just stood up. What's the big deal?"
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   Well, the way that, again, a Jew would have heard this,
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   it's very significant because in Hebrews 10-11,
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.820]   this is how priests are described.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.820]   Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.820]   But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time,
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.820]   sat down at the right hand of God.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   So he makes a distinction that all other priests were standing,
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.820]   but Jesus sat down.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   And there's huge significance in that because at the tabernacle,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.820]   there was no seat.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.820]   It was not like a place where you say, "Oh, I'm so tired.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.820]   I'm going to go into the tent and rest for a while."
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.820]   That is not where the tabernacle was.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   You came in, you did the job, whether you were a priest
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.820]   or whether you were the one who brought the sacrifice,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.820]   it was a sacred place.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.820]   You did your work and you get out.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   There was no other seat, except one.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.820]   Do you know where that seat was?
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.820]   Some of you guys who were alive when we were doing the Book of Leviticus, right?
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.820]   Do you remember?
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.820]   There's only one seat in the tabernacle.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.820]   Do you remember where that was?
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.820]   The mercy seat.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.820]   If you remember the mercy seat, it's described as the two wings of Seraphim,
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.820]   and at the middle there's a seat.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.820]   And nobody is able to sit there.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   The high priest could only go into the Holy of Holies, the inner chamber,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   and he would do his business.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:37.820]   He would sprinkle the blood of the animals, representing cleansing of the sins.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:44.820]   And so the mercy seat was the place where the Holy God came and met the sinners.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   So that's where God met Israel.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.820]   And the high priest, representing the nation of Israel, God's people,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.820]   met God at that mercy seat.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.820]   That mercy seat was not for him.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.820]   If he sat down there, he would have died.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:07.820]   In fact, it was such a scary, terrifying thing to enter the Holy of Holies,
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:12.820]   God told Aaron to put a bell on him so that when he went in,
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.820]   people outside could hear that possibly, maybe, he would die.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.820]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.820]   Remember the very first gift that is offered up, Neideb and Nebihu?
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.820]   Because they didn't do it right, they died.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   And that was just a regular sacrifice.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.820]   The high priest was to enter into the most sacred place.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.820]   So if these two offerers died giving a regular sacrifice,
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   how much more would a high priest be in danger if he went in there nonchalantly
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.820]   and didn't follow the prescription that God told him?
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.820]   So he actually had to put a bell on.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.820]   So the significance behind when he says,
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.820]   "We have such a high priest who has taken his seat,"
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:05.820]   it has huge theological implication because the only seat that existed at the tabernacle
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   was at the mercy seat, meaning Christ came and he sat on that seat.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.820]   That he was the only one who was going to mediate between sinners and God.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   If he was a man, he would have died.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   If he wasn't a god, he wouldn't be able to enter.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.820]   He was the perfect mediator between God and man.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.820]   And that's what it means that he sat down.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.820]   In other words, he came and he never came back out.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.820]   Just like every other priest, they went and did their work,
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.820]   they stood up and then they had to leave,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.820]   that Jesus came in, he sat on his throne, and he never came out.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.820]   In other words, his work of mediation was finished.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.820]   That's what he means.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.820]   That only Christ, who came in the order of Melchizedek,
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:03.820]   King of righteousness, King of peace, sat down.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   Now, again, when we read this not understanding the context,
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.820]   it's like, "Oh, he sat down. He must have been tired."
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.820]   It means that he was the only one who was qualified.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.820]   It meant that he sat down and never came back out.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:25.820]   He sat down on the throne that even the most holiest of men, the high priest,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.820]   could only do his work and come out.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.820]   That was his throne. He sat down.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.820]   That's what that means.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.820]   Secondly, it says he sat down at the right hand of the throne.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   Now, the term "right hand," we use that all the time, too.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   Somebody says, "He's my right-hand man."
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.820]   What we mean by that is I have full confidence in him.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.820]   He has the same authority.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   He's my ambassador, so he's my right-hand man.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.820]   Whatever I need to do, he's the guy that I rely on to get it done.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.820]   That's what we mean by "right hand."
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.820]   The term "right hand" in the Bible is a very significant term
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.820]   because it is used at the throne of Christ repeatedly.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:13.820]   Psalm 110, Matthew 22, Ephesians 1, Romans 8, Mark 16, Acts 2, 7, Hebrews 10, 13.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:19.820]   Over and over again, there's a reason why the throne of God, throne of Christ,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.820]   the mercy seat, is mentioned as the right hand of God.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   Now, we can get into the deep theological meaning behind that,
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.820]   but I just want to highlight for the sake of time this morning
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:36.820]   that it basically means it is a place of power and authority.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.820]   Typically, when we think of sitting down, we think of resting, right?
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.820]   We think of resting.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   But that term means something different when we're referring to the king.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.820]   When we say the king is on his throne, what do we mean by that?
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.820]   We don't mean, "Oh, the king is resting."
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   Usually, when we say the king is on his throne, it means that he is ruling.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.820]   There's somebody in charge.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.820]   Somebody is taking care of his kingdom.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.820]   That's what we mean.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   So a regular person sitting simply just means we're sitting.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   But for him to sit at the right hand of God, meaning that he is sitting as the king.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:22.820]   That's why he is described as a king of righteousness and king of mercy.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   He is sitting on the throne at the right hand because he is continuing to rule.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.820]   In Psalm 118, verse 16, the right hand of the Lord is exalted.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.820]   Meaning his position at the right hand is being exalted for God's purpose, his work.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.820]   Psalm 110, verse 1, the Lord says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.820]   until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   In other words, he's not sitting on his throne just resting.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   He's not exalted and just kind of receiving the glory.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:05.820]   He's sitting on his throne at the right hand of God to continue the work of conquering what he needs to conquer.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   And what does he need to conquer? 1 Corinthians 15, 25, 26.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.820]   "For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:18.820]   The last enemy that will be abolished is death."
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   Now let me stop right here to make sure that we understand
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:27.820]   this doesn't just kind of go all over your head and then it's just theological mumbo-jumbo.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   The point that he's trying to make is the primary work of our king,
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:41.820]   who's sitting at the right hand of the throne of God, is to conquer our sins.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   Which is what is causing death.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.820]   Now the reason why this is so important is, first of all, we recognize
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   that we are at war.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.820]   That's what the Bible tells us. One of the primary problems that Christians get into
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   is especially because we live in a country where we're not threatened with violence,
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.820]   at least not right now.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   We live in peace and so we have the blessing of worrying about the future of our children
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   where many, many people around the world, that's not even on their thought.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.820]   You know, mention garage sale when you travel. How many people understand what that is?
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.820]   You know what I mean? Garage sale is for rich people who have extra stuff that they bought
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.820]   they don't need that they need to get rid of. That's what a garage sale is.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.820]   That's only for rich people.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.820]   Majority of the people around the world, that's not a thing.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   They don't have extra stuff. They're just trying to feed their kids.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   And even in their faith, just to get together is a big deal.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.820]   You know, I think about us because of pandemic and everybody just went
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.820]   and we had the luxury of going online.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.820]   That's not a thing in majority of the world.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.820]   Just going online. Oh, we just go online.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.820]   And then when it's over, we just come back. That's not a thing.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.820]   Majority of the people in the world don't have that option.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.820]   If they don't get together, they don't get together.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.820]   See, because you and I live in such comfort, we have a hard time understanding
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.820]   that there is a spiritual battle going on until something happens around us
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.820]   that all of a sudden we get shocked like, "Oh my gosh, this is going on?"
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.820]   This is the state of mankind.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.820]   It's just that you and I live in a place where we constantly forget.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.820]   See, He's on His throne.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:30.820]   And that's why He called His disciples to go to the remotest part of the world
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.820]   to make disciples.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.820]   In other words, to join Him in His endeavor to get the gospel out.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:42.820]   So every Christian, every church's primary mission is to preach the gospel.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.820]   It is the character of the church to care about the poor.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.820]   It is the character of the church to be concerned about injustice.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.820]   It is not the mission.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   The mission is not different than the mission of Christ.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.820]   It is to preach the gospel and bring the lost into His kingdom.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:08.820]   And then when they are in the kingdom, the character of the church is to get involved and help.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.820]   See, He's sitting on the right throne.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   That's why we have confidence to do what we need to do.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.820]   Romans 8, 33-35.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.820]   Who will bring a charge against God's elect?
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.820]   God is the one who justifies.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.820]   Who is the one who condemns?
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.820]   Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God,
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.820]   who also intercedes for us.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.820]   Why do we have this confidence?
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   Because He sits at the right hand of God.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.820]   That's the significance behind He sitting at the right hand.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.820]   Numbers 7, 55-56.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.820]   Here's something interesting.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.820]   This is when Stephen is being stoned, first martyr in the early church,
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.820]   and we see Christ at the right hand of God.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.820]   But the way He is described is interesting in verse 55.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.820]   "But being full of the Holy Spirit, He gazed intently into heaven."
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.820]   Let's talk about Stephen as he is dying, he's looking into heaven.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.820]   "And saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:12.820]   And said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'"
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.820]   Now first, there's two things I want you to observe here.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.820]   One, why didn't Jesus save him?
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.820]   If he was standing, he was so concerned, why didn't He save him?
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:30.820]   Why didn't He get down there and crush His enemies?
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.820]   Again, we'll talk about that.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   But secondly, you see, He is standing.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.820]   And His standing shows His compassion.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:45.820]   That though He is the King, it is also the mercy seat that He is sitting in.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   So His throne is where He represents the righteousness and justice of God,
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.820]   and where sinners come to see His mercy.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   And only Christ and Christ alone can carry out perfect justice and perfect mercy.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:08.820]   See, when sinners try to carry out justice, we end up carrying out vengeance.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.820]   Because of the sin in our hearts.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.820]   Because of bitterness and anger and coveting.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.820]   So when we seek justice, we usually don't stop with justice.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.820]   We usually seek vengeance.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.820]   We want them to get the message.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.820]   You killed one of ours, we killed two of yours.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   That's why Jesus says the kingdom, the character of the kingdom is not to fight and destroy evil.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.820]   He says turn the other cheek and represent Him.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:47.820]   We have to be careful that we do not seek justice as the world seeks justice.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:56.820]   Because if we seek justice as the world seeks justice, all it's going to do is to create anger on the other side.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.820]   He's sitting on His throne. He is the one.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:08.820]   That's why if there's any time where we need to come to His throne of righteousness, His throne of mercy, it is now.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.820]   Where we find wisdom with Him.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.820]   We say what He says. We do what He does.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.820]   Especially now.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:22.820]   I'm trying not to get political.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.820]   Right now you're hearing voices from all over. Extreme voices from opposite ends.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:38.820]   And the voices that you are hearing on both sides are confident that they are representing God.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   Which makes it very confusing for an average person.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.820]   I respect this guy. This guy loves Christ and yet he's saying one thing.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.820]   I respect this guy and he loves Christ and he's saying the other thing.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:57.820]   There's a reason why the Bible says at the end time that delusion is going to be so great.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:06.820]   That even if the elect can be deceived, if it was possible, in other words, obviously it's not possible,
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:10.820]   but he's saying that delusion is going to be that strong.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   Because our enemy is going to come as an angel of light.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.820]   So I want to warn our church again.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:24.820]   If there's any time that you need to be sober and pay very close attention to what is going on,
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.820]   what the scripture says, is now.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:34.820]   Before you fight for any cause, ask yourselves, where are you with Christ?
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:42.820]   If you're not in the Word and you're not praying, if you've never fought for souls,
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:51.820]   if you've never shared the gospel, don't make the first obedience in your life fighting for injustice.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:52:00.820]   The first thing that we need to make sure is that we are obedient to what he has called us to, that is clear.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:09.820]   So, that does not mean that if we're Christians and if we study the Bible and we're sharing the gospel with our neighbors,
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.820]   that we shouldn't care about injustice.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.820]   Not at all. In the book of James it says, "Faith without deeds is dead."
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:23.820]   If you see the suffering of the people around you and it is clear what needs to be done and you stay silent,
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.820]   that's not love. That's not love either.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:34.820]   But again, the caution is, whatever it is that we endeavor to do, we need to be sober, we need to be careful,
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   that we need to make sure that it's the Word of God and his Spirit that is leading and guiding us.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:46.820]   So, I want to say what I have always said and I'm going to say it again. Be skeptical.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:55.820]   Examine everything. Examine what you're reading. Examine the statistics that you're hearing.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:01.820]   Examine who it's coming from, why it's coming, what the verses that they're quoting, where are they quoting that from.
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:02.820]   Examine everything.
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:11.820]   Make sure that your eyes are fixed upon Christ because right now, if you are not, you may have strong passions,
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   but be very deceived if you are not anchored in Christ.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:23.820]   Our Savior is sitting on the throne and he's actively working. This is nothing new.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:30.820]   But the spirit of delusion and divisiveness in the church is more powerful than I've ever seen it.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   I've seen it a lot. It's more powerful now than I've ever seen it.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:41.820]   Third point that he makes is not only is he at the seat and he's at the right hand of God,
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.820]   he says he's sitting on the throne of majesty in heaven. This is a heavenly throne.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:52.820]   Hebrews 8, 2-3, "A minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched not men."
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   The true tabernacle.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.820]   Again, Hebrews 9, 24, "For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy."
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   A mere copy of the true one, "but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.820]   In other words, all this stuff that people are drifting back into, your old way of life,
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.820]   the old things that you were thinking, they were only to prepare you for the reality that's coming in Christ.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.820]   So there is no substance there.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:24.820]   There is no reality there. All of it was simply to prepare you for the coming of Christ.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.820]   Hebrews 9, 11, "But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come,
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:37.820]   he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation."
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:42.820]   Now, this is huge.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   Again, if you just read this like if you're reading any other book, it's just like,
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   "Okay, Jesus, that's a true, it's a shadow in the reality that's coming."
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.820]   But I see so many Christians who completely miss this.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:10.820]   Even though it is very plain and obvious that Christ's kingdom and his tabernacle that he came to fulfill is not of this earth.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:16.820]   And that's why he says in verse 4 of chapter 8,
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:22.820]   "If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law."
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:27.820]   In other words, if Jesus came to reestablish his kingdom on earth,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.820]   he would be disqualified because he's not from the Levites.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:38.820]   He can't even be a priest. Not only is he not a priest, he's the worst person to pick.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   If the goal was to have a better country, to have better laws, to have a better economy,
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.820]   so that if we invest and fight for justice, that we're going to have a better country next five years.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.820]   Jesus is not the man to lead us in that.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:04.820]   He wasn't rich. He wasn't educated. He wasn't articulate. He didn't come from any particular pedigree.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   He had no political power.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:14.820]   So, if his fight was to establish, reestablish his kingdom on earth,
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:19.820]   Jesus would have been the worst person. He would have been disqualified just by his birth.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.820]   That's what he means by that.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:26.820]   Look at the way he's described in Isaiah 53, 2-3.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:31.820]   "He grew up before him like a tender shoot." Tender shoot meaning weak.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:35.820]   "And like a root out of a parched ground, where you wouldn't find any fruit.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.820]   He has no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him,
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.820]   nor appearance that we should be attracted to him."
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   You know what he just said? He's not a good-looking man.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:53.820]   That's pretty offensive, and it's written in his inerrant word.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.820]   So, this is inerrant. There's no error in this.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.820]   This is not somebody's opinion.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.820]   You know, you rate him as a... you rate him 7, I rate him 36.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.820]   God said, "He's not an attractive man."
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.820]   There was nothing about him.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:13.820]   Nothing in his state, his appearance, none of it would attract a human being to him.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:22.820]   If his goal was to be this dynamic leader to unite the world under his leadership
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:26.820]   to reestablish his kingdom, Jesus was not the man.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   He would have been disqualified right off the bat.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:34.820]   He was despised and forsaken of men. A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:41.820]   You know, whenever we see pictures of Jesus, we see him with, you know, like a glow on his face,
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   and he's got children sitting on his lap, and he's just a happy-go-lucky guy, right?
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:54.820]   It's like, "Oh, if you see a man like that, man, I want to be that guy, because that person is very inviting."
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:59.820]   He says he was despised and forsaken, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:04.820]   You ever see anybody who is sorrowful and acquainted with grief?
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.820]   Like, I mean, we're not just talking about they just experienced something.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.820]   We're talking about their life is filled with grief.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.820]   You ever see somebody whose life was just that difficult?
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:17.820]   Yeah, they're not attractive.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.820]   They got a scowl on their face, constantly.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.820]   You know, I remember years ago, I went to Romania, and a lot of these guys work on the farm,
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.820]   literally 10, 15, 16, 17 hours a day.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:36.820]   And they would come for some medical advice, and so we had a different camp coming,
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   and we would sit and interview them, and I would ask them, "How old are you?"
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.820]   And they would tell me their age, and I was shocked,
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:51.820]   because in my mind, they were 70, 75 years old, and some of these guys were my age.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.820]   And obviously, you know, I didn't say, "What happened to you?"
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.820]   You know, like, I know what happened.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.820]   They had a hard life.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.820]   They had a very difficult life.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.820]   And so they aged.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:09.820]   So he said, "In every way, a human leader, whether political,
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:15.820]   Jesus would have been disqualified."
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:22.820]   And you would think maybe God, you know, made a mistake.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.820]   Obviously, that would be blasphemy.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.820]   Why did Jesus come in that form?
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:33.820]   He could have easily, with no effort, made him an attractive man,
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   made him an inviting man, an articulate man.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.820]   How hard would it have been for Jesus to be born in the household of Caesar?
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.820]   It would have been nothing for him.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:50.820]   How hard would it have been for Jesus to be a muscular, tall, handsome, articulate,
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.820]   where everybody would want him as your leader?
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   Why did he make him the exact opposite?
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:05.820]   For the same reason why God was angry with Israel when they asked and demanded a king.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:12.820]   You want to follow a man, but I am your king.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:20.820]   The whole sinfulness of man is they'd rather worship a creation in their image.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:25.820]   So they want to follow a man, a better version of themselves.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.820]   That's what they want.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.820]   That's what mankind wants in a leader.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.820]   Somebody like me, but better.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:38.820]   That's the idolatry in our own hearts.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.820]   Jesus came to abolish all of that.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   The very desire that you have, even when you think it's good,
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.820]   is in the context of rebellion against God.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.820]   And that's why he says his kingdom, his tabernacle, is not of this earth.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.820]   That's why in Colossians 3-4 it says,
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   "Set your mind on things above, not on the things that are on earth,
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.820]   for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.820]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory."
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   The first step of eternal life is dying to ourselves.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   The first step of meeting Christ and living a new life is dying to ourselves.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.820]   That's why when we get baptized, we say, "You are being buried with Christ."
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.820]   That's the first step.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.820]   And that's what repentance is.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   Repentance isn't, "Oh, I had some lust. I did this and I did this."
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.820]   No. The first act of repentance is repentance over who I am.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   My very nature is tainted, so my mind is tainted.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.820]   My emotions are tainted.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.820]   What makes me happy is tainted.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.820]   What gives me hope is tainted.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.820]   What I think is right is tainted.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.820]   What I think is wrong is tainted.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.820]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.820]   So the first thing that he tells us in eternal life is that we recognize
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:12.820]   the deepest part of who I am has been tainted by sin.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.820]   And that's what he is trying to deliver us from.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.820]   Not simply the consequence of sin, but the power of sin.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.820]   And that's why he says the last enemy is death.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:32.820]   That's why he says, "He who finds his life shall lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake shall find it."
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.820]   In our pursuit of justice, are we trying to find life on our own terms?
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.820]   Is Christ being exalted?
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.820]   And then he says, Hebrews chapter 8, 5,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:51.820]   "Who serve a copy in the shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle."
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   See how he says, "That you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain."
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:03.820]   So he says, not only is it heaven, the whole point of the tabernacle is to reflect what Moses saw at the mountain, right?
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:09.820]   So let me ask you, when he says the tabernacle was made in the pattern of what Moses saw,
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.820]   did Moses see a miniature version of the tabernacle?
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   Is that what he saw? Is that what that means?
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.820]   Like, make it in the pattern that you saw.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:25.820]   You know how, like, you meet architect students who are studying, and they would make a little architectural building?
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.820]   You ever see that? Right?
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.820]   And it looks like, or maybe you are an architect, and you make a physical building
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.820]   to present to your client so that they can physically see, this is what we're going to build, right?
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:48.820]   Is that what he means? That Moses saw a miniature version of the tabernacle to go back and build it exactly?
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.820]   I mean, Moses must have had some fantastic memory.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.820]   Because he had, you know, he had the measurements to the T.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.820]   Is that what he saw? Is that what he means by pattern?
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:04.820]   I don't think so. I don't think he saw a miniature version of the tabernacle,
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.820]   and God said, "Make sure you make it perfectly, or you die."
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.820]   I don't think that's what happened.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:15.820]   In fact, when he goes up to the mountain, there's only one thing that the Bible records that he saw.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.820]   Do you remember what that was?
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.820]   God's glory.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:25.820]   That's what he saw. Remember?
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:30.820]   So, God's glory made such an impression on him,
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.820]   that even just a reflection of that, people saw that you saw God's glory.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.820]   And they were terrified.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:42.820]   So, it doesn't spell it out, but when you put two and two together,
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:49.820]   he's not making a copy of a miniature version of the tabernacle that he saw, and then making it.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:54.820]   What he saw was an impression of his glory, what made such an impact on him.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   The tabernacle was to represent God's glory.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   So, what did the tabernacle teach?
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.820]   First and foremost, that God is holy.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.820]   And that sinful man cannot approach him in his natural state.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:10.820]   That's the first thing.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   And this is the thing that people don't understand.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:20.820]   That, you know, the tabernacle existed at the center of the Israelite community.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.820]   And people may think, "Oh, it would have been great to have the tabernacle there.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.820]   Wouldn't it have been awesome if the Ark of the Covenant was in the middle of the camp?"
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.820]   Are you kidding?
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:40.820]   Aaron had to wear a bell just in case he died going into the Holy of Holies.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:49.820]   The first offering that was given, the two of his sons are consumed by fire.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:58.820]   Do you think having a tabernacle, that tabernacle in the middle of the camp, had warm, fuzzy feelings?
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   My guess is they were terrified.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:08.820]   Can you imagine a mother with a small child and the child not understanding what's going on,
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.820]   started running into the tabernacle?
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   You think the mother would have been, "Ah, you know, let him play a little bit, you know, free babysitting.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.820]   Maybe the priest will watch him."
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:25.820]   My guess is they were more terrified of a child wandering into the tabernacle
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.820]   than a mother would be afraid of a toddler walking on the freeway.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:38.820]   The tabernacle was terrifying because it was constantly taught, "You cannot come.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.820]   You cannot come. There's no seat there."
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:45.820]   There's reasons why these animals were being slaughtered all day long.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:50.820]   Every time they saw a barbecue, they didn't smell the barbecue and say, "Oh, that smells good."
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:58.820]   That barbecue reminded them that there is no atonement for sin until there is death,
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.820]   until there's shedding of blood.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.820]   It was a very bloody scene.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:07.820]   There was constantly blood flowing from the tabernacle.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:14.820]   And so the first thing that Moses recognized when he saw God's glory was terror.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.820]   And that's what that tabernacle represented.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.820]   You cannot come to this holy God nonchalantly.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.820]   And that man is utterly sinful.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   That you cannot appease God by your strength.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.820]   God did not require that we be good.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.820]   God required perfection.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.820]   Perfection.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.820]   It wasn't enough. He said, "Oh, that's not what I meant.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   Oh, I did 99 percent."
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.820]   No, He required perfection.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:51.820]   So imagine that, if you're an Israelite, that at the center of your camp.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   And God told Moses to build this in the pattern that you saw.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:01.820]   With the impression that you got when you saw my glory, build that in that pattern.
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.820]   And that's what he built.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.820]   As he was terrified,
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:13.820]   as he was terrified by the glory of God,
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.820]   the people of God were terrified by God's presence.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:20.820]   And it was necessary for them to be terrified.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.820]   For them to understand where they stood.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:29.820]   And the danger that they were in, if they didn't take this seriously.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.820]   The constant nature of the sacrifices.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.820]   That no matter how great, no matter how well-meaning,
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.820]   no matter how much sacrifice you made on Monday,
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.820]   you had to sacrifice again on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.820]   No matter how great a celebration of Day of Atonement,
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.820]   next year you had to do it again.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.820]   So the constant nature for the need of sacrifices reminded the people,
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   no matter how much you sacrifice, you will continue to need sacrifices.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:00.820]   You will never wash away this sin.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   Tomorrow you will have to do it again, and the next day you will have to do it again.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.820]   And even the ones who were making the sacrifices were limited by their own sin and their finiteness.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:15.820]   Which pointed to the fact that none of this was going to get them to God.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   None of this was going to get them to God.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.820]   That's what he was patterning.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.820]   That's what he was trying to point out.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:29.820]   And it is that tabernacle, the heavenly tabernacle, that all of that pointed to,
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.820]   the end conclusion of all of this was, only one man can sit on that throne.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:45.820]   Only one man, and only one sacrifice, is perfect enough to satisfy the wrath of God.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.820]   That's what that tabernacle was for.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:55.820]   And it is that tabernacle, it is that heavenly throne, where he says he sat down
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   at the right hand of the throne of majesty in heaven.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:05.820]   And because of that, he says, he has a more excellent ministry.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.820]   He has a better mediator, a better covenant, with a better promise.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.820]   Now what is the application of all of this for Christians today?
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   Instead of not just like, oh that's great.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   Anything that you and I endeavor, anything.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   Getting married, having children, starting a business.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   Getting a college degree, getting a job.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:52.820]   Anything that we endeavor in, that doesn't exalt Christ first, is under the judgment of God.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:58.820]   It's under the judgment of God, no matter how wildly you succeed.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:05.820]   No matter how wildly you succeed, in the eyes of the world,
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.820]   at the end of the day, it is under the judgment of God.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:15.820]   You cannot appease the wrath of God by human effort.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   You cannot.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   That's what the tabernacle taught.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   That's what the sacrifices reminded us of.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.820]   And that's why, first and foremost, we must come to Christ.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:35.820]   First and foremost, we must come to Christ.
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.820]   It doesn't matter if you create a perfect government.
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:42.820]   It doesn't matter if we have the greatest economy.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:48.820]   It doesn't matter if we have the greatest leader, the greatest laws, the greatest movement.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.820]   It doesn't matter.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   At the end of the day, if Christ isn't exalted, all of that is still under the judgment of God.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:04.820]   That's why the end conclusion of all of this is to fix our eyes upon Christ, to be anchored in Christ.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:11.820]   No matter how well-meaning we are, no matter how well-intended we are, is Christ first.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.820]   So, let me conclude with this.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.820]   With practical application, with what's going on around us, and I know there's a lot of conversations right now.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.820]   Should we not care about what's going on?
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   Of course we should care.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.820]   Of course we should care.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   We should care about poverty.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:38.820]   We should care about sex trafficking.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:41.820]   We should care about injustice.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.820]   We should care about division.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.820]   We should care about the racial injustice.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.820]   We should care about all of these things.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:56.820]   And you and I live in a free country where we have the ability to speak, ability to vote.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   We're not living in suppression from the government, for the most part.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:06.820]   So, the call to the gospel ministry is not a call to be passive.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.820]   Because the indicatives of what the gospel teaches always leads to "therefore."
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:21.820]   Therefore. If we believe in all of this, therefore our life should reflect that love.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   But, it must always begin with Christ.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:33.820]   If you say, "Is that all we're going to do?"
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.820]   And then you've never done it.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   And that's where we need to start.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.820]   If you've never shared the gospel, and you're complaining, "All we're going to do is share the gospel?"
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   No. We're not only going to share the gospel.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.820]   But if you've never shared the gospel, that's the first thing that the churches need to start.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.820]   If you have a church filled with people who've never shared the gospel, and then you say, "All we're going to share this gospel?"
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.820]   No. You have to first share the gospel.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.820]   And in my opinion, that's our biggest problem right now.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.820]   It's not that we're not getting involved, or we're not doing this, or we're not doing that.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.820]   For the most part, most churches are sick. They're not healthy.
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:18.820]   They're not living up to what the Bible has already plainly stated in the scripture.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   And you can't organize a sick church to make the society healthy.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:30.820]   So, our priority is to make the church healthy.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.820]   But the reason why we need to make the church healthy is when you have a healthy church,
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   we can help a sick world.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.820]   But you don't recruit sick people to help sick people.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.820]   That's why we preach the gospel.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.820]   That's why we preach the gospel first.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.820]   Because until people are regenerated and meet Christ,
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.820]   until the work of God is working powerfully in our hearts,
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.820]   anything else we do in our power, in our own might,
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   is always going to end in frustration and failure.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   So, let me, again, if our praise team is here, if I can ask you guys to come back up.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:18.820]   We're going to take just a minute as we prepare to pray.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.820]   And I'm going to ask you to take a few, just a few minutes to pray
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.820]   before they lead us into our next worship.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.820]   And if you could just begin us.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:31.820]   I'm really asking you guys, because there are so many voices,
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.820]   and maybe some of you guys don't, you know, just don't, haven't been paying attention.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.820]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:38.820]   Okay.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.820]   That's fine.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:40.820]   Okay.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   But if that's not you, and you're hearing all these voices,
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.820]   you're being pulled left and right, and you don't know where to stand,
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.820]   and you have compassion, which is great, you want to do something,
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   but at the same time, the voices are so strong on either side, you're confused.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.820]   Don't go from that confusion and just make a leap.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.820]   The Bible says, "If you lack wisdom, to come to God."
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.820]   Right?
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.820]   "We'll give you without finding fault."
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.820]   Meaning, first and foremost, he invites us to himself.
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.820]   So right now, if there's, again, like I said,
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:16.820]   if there's any time where the church needs to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.820]   it's right now.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   Right?
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.820]   And so I want to invite you to take a few minutes to pray.
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.820]   Ask God to start with you.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:29.820]   Before, before the society, before, you know, the injustice and all that,
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   start with you.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.820]   Where are you with Christ right now?
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.820]   And I know the pandemic has caused us to kind of,
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820]   a lot of people have drifted in their faith.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.820]   Maybe that's you, that you haven't really been paying attention,
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:45.820]   and then the first, first emotions that you felt with, like,
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.820]   "I got to do something."
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.820]   Well, I want to invite you, first and foremost, to come before the Lord.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:51.820]   Ask the Lord to search your heart.
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.820]   Where are you?
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.820]   If you're not walking right with God,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.820]   it's been a long time since you spent meaningful time in prayer.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.820]   It's been a while since you really diligently searched the Scriptures.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   Before you worry about anything else, first come before God.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:08.820]   Ask God to bring you to him first.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:09.820]   Right?
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.820]   And so let's take some time to pray again,
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.820]   and after we do that, our worship team will lead us.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.820]   So let me pray for us,
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.820]   and then I'm going to ask you guys to continue to be in that prayer as they lead us.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.820]   Heavenly Father, we want to lift up our church,
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.820]   lift up ourselves first and foremost, Lord God, that you would examine our hearts.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:34.820]   Especially now, Lord, as we live in very volatile and confusing times.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.820]   Help us, Lord, to truly be anchored in Christ.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.820]   That before we listen to any voices around us,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   teach us, Lord God, to search your word,
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.820]   to examine if anything that has been said, even this morning,
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:54.820]   that if this truly is from you.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.820]   So I pray, Father God, that your grace would be sufficient,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:02.820]   that your children would hear your voice and follow you and you alone.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:05.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   [music]
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.820]   [music]
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.820]   [music]
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:26.820]   [music]
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:41.820]   [music]
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.820]   [music]
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   [music]
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:07.820]   [music]
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.820]   [music]
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:24.820]   [music]
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.820]   Let's all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.820]   [music]
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   One day.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:20:01.820]   One day when heaven is filled with his praises,
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   One day when sin was as black as could be,
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:14.820]   Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:20.820]   And dwelt among men like example is he.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:26.820]   Word became flesh and the light shined among us,
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:32.820]   His glory revealed. Living he loved me,
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.820]   Dying he saved me,
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:42.820]   Buried he carried my sins far away.
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.820]   Rising he justified,
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.820]   Freely forever,
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.820]   One day he's coming,
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:57.820]   Oh glory yes day, Oh glory yes day.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   One day they led him to Calvary's mountain,
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:17.820]   One day they nailed him to die on a tree.
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:24.820]   Suffering anguish, despise and rejected,
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:30.820]   Burying our sins by example is he.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   Hands that kill nations stretched out on a tree,
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.820]   Took the nails for me.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.820]   Living he loved me,
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.820]   Dying he saved me,
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:52.820]   Buried he carried my sins far away.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:55.820]   Rising he justified,
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.820]   Freely forever,
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.820]   One day he's coming,
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:08.820]   Oh glory yes day, Oh glory yes day.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:21.820]   One day the grave could conceal him no longer,
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:28.820]   One day the stone rolled away from the door.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:34.820]   Then he arose over death he had conquered,
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:40.820]   Now he's descended, my Lord evermore.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:47.820]   Death could not hold him, the grave could not keep him,
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.820]   Rising again.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:53.820]   Living he loved me,
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.820]   Dying he saved me,
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:03.820]   Buried he carried my sins far away.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   Rising he justified,
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.820]   Freely forever,
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:12.820]   One day he's coming,
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   Oh glory yes day.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.820]   Living he loved me,
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.820]   Dying he saved me,
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:28.820]   Buried he carried my sins far away.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.820]   Rising he justified,
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   Freely forever,
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:38.820]   One day he's coming,
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:45.820]   Oh glory yes day, Oh glory yes day.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:24:00.820]   Let's pray.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:05.820]   Heavenly Father we pray for your mercy and grace,
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.820]   Lord God to be sufficient for us.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.820]   May your love overwhelm the hearts of the people,
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.820]   Lord God that you have called to yourself,
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.820]   that we may eagerly wait for the coming of Christ.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.820]   Lord God that when we say that we have been crucified with Christ,
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   that it is no longer us we live,
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.820]   that it is not simply a Bible verse Lord that we memorize to comfort our hearts.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.820]   Help us to live this truth Lord God,
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.820]   to examine every part of our lives where we are kicking and screaming,
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.820]   Lord God because we want to be recognized,
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.820]   because we want to have an easier life.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.820]   Help us Lord to see your glory as our ultimate cause,
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.820]   that the world may know Father God that there's only hope in Jesus Christ.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.820]   Especially now Lord with all the turmoil and all the divisiveness,
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:54.820]   Lord God whether in politics or even inside the church.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   I pray Father God that Christ and his crucifixion and his resurrection,
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.820]   would unite us to bring revival in our hearts,
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.820]   knowing Father God that we are only aliens passing through.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:09.820]   That we may truly live lives worthy of the gospel that you've given us.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.820]   That the world will know Father God that we are your disciples,
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:16.820]   because of the love that you've given us that we practice.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.820]   So we pray that wherever you send us,
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:23.820]   give us the courage Lord God to live a life that magnifies you.
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:27.820]   Help us to stand for truth Lord God no matter what the consequence.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:31.820]   Help us to be compassionate and loving no matter what the consequence.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.820]   And help us to discern when to apply in what situation.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.820]   So we ask for your wisdom as you send us,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   in all that we do may Christ and his glory shine.
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:44.820]   Amen.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.820]   God sent his Son
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:56.820]   They called him Jesus
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:00.820]   He came to love
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   Heal and forgive
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:11.820]   He lived and died
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:17.820]   To buy my father
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   An antique grave is there to save your life
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   Because he lives
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:38.820]   I can face tomorrow
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.820]   Because he lives
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:48.820]   All fear is gone
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:54.820]   Because I know
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.820]   He holds the future
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:04.820]   And life is worth the living
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:09.820]   Just because he lives
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.820]   Just because he lives
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   Amen.
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.820]   Amen.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:22.820]   (silence)
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:27.820]   (silence)
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.820]   (silence)
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:48.820]   (silence)
