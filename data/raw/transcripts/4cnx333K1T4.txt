[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.740]   - You may be seated.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:33.160]   Okay, we're gonna do our prayer meeting
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.800]   a little bit different today.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.960]   And probably going forward, we're probably gonna use
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.800]   this format more than what we've done before.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.640]   We're gonna give you a good chunk of time
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.200]   for you to pray by yourself.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.020]   We wanna get in a habit of praying
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.320]   for a more extended period of time.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.180]   And I know some of you guys are very awkward
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.680]   and I could tell you sometimes even three minutes,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.860]   you know, three or five minutes,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.360]   like some of you already kinda like your mind is wandering
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.240]   and you're having a hard time praying.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.660]   If you do not learn to persevere through that,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.880]   you will never learn how to pray, right?
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.680]   So if the moment you get distracted
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.280]   or oh, I don't know what to say and then you stop praying,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.720]   you'll never practice your muscle how to pray.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.860]   Just like anything else, if you want a fellowship,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.060]   and if only fellowship happens
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.660]   when it automatically happens.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.760]   Somebody just, you know, it's just organic
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   and it just happens all the time
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.320]   and you're not deliberate about it,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.080]   you know, you probably aren't experiencing
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.040]   genuine fellowship.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.640]   And same thing with the Bible, right?
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.000]   We're doing inductive Bible study.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.840]   How much you get out of the Bible study
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.760]   is directly linked to how much time you put digging
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.160]   and struggling and wrestling with the text, right?
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.240]   And same thing with evangelism.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.960]   Evangelism, you know, isn't somebody's,
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.320]   isn't gonna just come up to you and say,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.640]   hey, teach me how to get to heaven, right?
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.920]   You have to be praying and deliberately searching
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.680]   and then sometimes get rejected
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.120]   and wrestle through how to answer prayers
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.280]   and that's how we become better at evangelism.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.860]   And same thing with prayer.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.560]   Prayer's not something that just like,
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.580]   oh, I don't know how to pray.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.840]   Those people are good at praying,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.480]   these people are not good at praying.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   And then so, you know, like if you do not learn
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.360]   how to wrestle in prayer, your ability to be able to pray
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.000]   never really matures and grows, right?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.200]   Only during periods of time of urgency
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.440]   or something's moving you emotionally.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.320]   But outside of that, you do maybe like one minute,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.760]   five minutes, six, seven minute prayer,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.200]   but if you've never prayed consistently
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.280]   for over 30, 40, 50 minutes to an hour,
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.440]   that's something that we need to kind of
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.420]   train ourselves to do.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.760]   So I'm gonna, we're gonna give you plenty of time to pray
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.840]   and then again, I wanna really like
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.760]   challenge you to struggle in prayer today, right?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.840]   Even if half the time, more than half the time,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.280]   your mind is wandering, you're thinking about,
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.780]   you know, should I have bought that stock or not, right?
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.400]   You know what stock I'm talking about.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.480]   Should I have bought that?
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.320]   Did I missed out on it?
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.120]   Should I show, even if all that stuff is going on
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   in your head, right, to learn to persevere in prayer, okay?
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.200]   So what I wanna do is we've given you a sheet
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.240]   for you to go through.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.600]   Now I give you a physical copy because I wanted you
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   to have that in front of you
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.280]   and to really pray through that.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.560]   So I don't wanna give you broad topics of,
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.240]   let's pray for missions and let's pray for this.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.320]   I wanted you to really get down to the specifics
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.400]   on what you're praying for.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.580]   So again, I'm not gonna give a, just as an encouragement,
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.600]   you know, at the Garden of Gethsemane in Matthew 26, 36,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.360]   Jesus takes his disciples and he's trying
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.480]   to get ready for what's coming the next day.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.080]   And you know the text, when he comes back,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.160]   he sees them sleeping and twice he says to them,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.760]   could you not stay and watch and pray with me
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.960]   for even one hour?
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.180]   Obviously it was in the middle of the night,
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.000]   they were tired, they had a huge meal, right?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.640]   But because it was that important,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.540]   he wanted them to wrestle in prayer, right?
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.720]   And so again, the challenge is to wrestle in prayer.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.120]   So what I wanna do is if you look at number one,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.980]   the very first thing that we should always do
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.840]   before we come to God is the sin of confession, right?
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.080]   If you look at the Old Testament,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.240]   there's five major, major offerings
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.400]   and the most frequently given offering
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.000]   was the burnt offering because that was
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.160]   the general offering for atonement.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.740]   And so before you did anything else,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.960]   there needed to be forgiveness,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.120]   there needed to be restoration.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.560]   So in the restoration, in Psalm 139, 23-24,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   it says, the psalmist says, search me, O God,
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.000]   and know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.200]   and see if there be any hurtful way in me
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   and lead me in the everlasting.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.320]   I'm less concerned about people who came into this room
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.480]   really feeling the need to repent.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.020]   Like your sins are weighing you down,
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.560]   maybe you've been struggling with something
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.280]   and you're not being successful.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.500]   And you know, as soon as I say,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.800]   we need to repent of something,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.000]   you know what it is that you need to repent of.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   The people who are gonna struggle in prayer tonight
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.520]   are the people who are not aware, right?
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.160]   Because you're not actively searching
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.600]   to guard our hearts and make sure
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.580]   that we're right before God.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.160]   And so that's what that psalmist is,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.480]   to come before God and search.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.800]   First of all, what are the compromises
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.680]   that you have accepted in your life
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.040]   that you've become desensitized?
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.760]   You know it's there, but you don't feel
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.080]   any strong urgency to pray.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.600]   There's two things that we need to pray for,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.640]   there's a sin of commission and sin of omission.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.880]   Sin of commission are the things that you've committed.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.720]   Maybe you watch things that you shouldn't have watched.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.980]   Maybe you've said things that you shouldn't have said.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.740]   Maybe you've gone places that you shouldn't have gone to.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.200]   Sin of omission are the things
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.000]   that God has commanded you to do
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.200]   and you are in a regular pattern of neglect.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.160]   And so those are things that you may not have thought about
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.920]   because you're just kind of in the habit of burying.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.200]   Maybe certain way of doing things.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.440]   And there's certain things that God has commanded you to do
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   and you're just like, ah, you know, I don't have the time,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.160]   I'm busy raising my children.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.000]   And so we have all kinds of excuses not to participate.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.320]   But in the end, the end result is disobedience.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.840]   So what are the sins of commission?
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.320]   What are the sins of omission?
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.680]   And again, James 4, 17 says,
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.000]   "Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.480]   "and does not do it, to him it is sin."
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.240]   So the first thing that we wanna encourage you to do
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.480]   is take some time to confess that before God.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.880]   Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.380]   Even if I'm not aware of it, help me, Lord,
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.880]   to be aware of it.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   What are the compromise that I've gotten accustom to?
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   Lord, help me to see the weight of sin.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   Help me to see sin the way you see sin.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.960]   And then to first come before the Lord and be specific.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.800]   So whenever you confess your sin,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.040]   don't just have a broad brush and say,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.320]   you know, I wanna be a better person,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.520]   I wanna be more focused.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   What are the specific sins?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.200]   What are the specific sins that you wanna come before God
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.920]   and pray and ask for forgiveness for those things, okay?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.760]   Specifically.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.640]   Second, building up with the body of Christ, the church.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.080]   Are there relationships that need to be reconciled
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.540]   that we have been ignoring?
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.120]   Now, I know that we may not have full control
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.760]   of all the relationships that we have.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   So the two questions that I encourage you to ask is,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.940]   do you have something against someone?
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.800]   You're holding a grudge against someone in your heart
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.240]   and you're not reconciled.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.720]   That person may not even know it, right?
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.680]   But you're harboring in your heart and you're justifying it
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   and that may have given a foothold for the devil
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.900]   and may have made your heart callous toward God.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.500]   So the first question is,
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.180]   are there things that you need to reconcile?
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.160]   Does someone have something against you
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.680]   that you are aware of?
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   The Bible's clear.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.800]   Before you come to the altar,
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.320]   if a brother has something against you,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.560]   go and deal with that first, right?
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.560]   So take time to think about the fellowship, right?
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   The second offering in the five major offerings
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.400]   is the peace offering, right?
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.640]   When we have peace with God,
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.680]   God calls us to have peace with one another.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.800]   So pray for specific people.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.440]   So outside of the reconciliation,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.480]   don't just pray broad strokes and pray for people.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.400]   Pray for the world.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.920]   I wanna encourage you to pray for specific people
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.760]   and where I encourage you to start is,
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.320]   pray calling out each name of the people
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.560]   in your small group, right?
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.480]   Name by name, what you know about that person,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.560]   what they're struggling,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.320]   what challenges are they going through.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.720]   If you are in a home group, pray by name,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.980]   one by one, pray for those people around you, right?
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.320]   So if you are leading one of those groups,
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.080]   make sure that you pray again for them, same thing.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.400]   And if you are a member in that group,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.540]   pray for the leaders in your group.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.280]   Again, don't just pray broadly,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.120]   pray each one individually.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.960]   Pray for our leadership in the church.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.960]   Pray for all the pastors, myself, Pastor Mark,
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.520]   Pastor Peter, Pastor Nate,
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.560]   and then the elders, Philip Kim, Joseph Chun, James Hong.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.960]   Again, it's always challenging,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.920]   but especially right now,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.440]   because of all the things that are going on,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.400]   there's constant things that are changing.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.640]   And we need to make sure that we,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.160]   everything that we want our church to do,
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.520]   that the leadership is first practicing this.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.040]   So there's specific things that we ask to pray for,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.600]   deepening prayer life for each one of us,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   that this is not just something that we do corporately,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.600]   but each individual,
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.560]   that we would grow in our depth in praying.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.440]   Unity in love, faith, and hope, right?
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.600]   And again, because we discuss a lot of things
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.320]   that a lot of times we may not fully be on the same page.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.120]   And if we keep a healthy distance, we're always united.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.960]   Right?
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.620]   Generally, we love Jesus, we love the church,
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.680]   but when we talk about the specific things
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.480]   about what we should or should not do,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.020]   there's always opportunity for the devil to come in
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.240]   and bring disunity.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.120]   So please pray for each one of us by name
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.960]   for unity and humility in heart,
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   wisdom to lead the church, and then above reproach.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.200]   Right?
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.760]   So everything that we're asking you to pray for,
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.320]   we ask that you would pray for each one of the leaders
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.780]   that we would set an example of what that means.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.640]   Spreading of the gospel, okay, locally and globally.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.120]   Pray for church-like college ministry
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.760]   as they started their campus ministry,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.800]   even though they're not physically on campus yet.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.580]   That ministry is going, again,
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.500]   started by, led by Pastor Nate.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.780]   And so please pray for them.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.080]   They meet every Wednesday here,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.740]   and then eventually when the campus opens,
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.860]   they're gonna be on campus for the purpose of evangelism.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.540]   And I was reading an article this morning
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.980]   that I think it's UCI and UCLA
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.500]   had record number of freshmen
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.980]   apply than ever in history.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.220]   So they think the pandemic may have something to do with it,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.400]   but they said they had record number, right?
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.120]   So there's that many students who are, you know,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.500]   who are probably gonna come into town.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.160]   So either God placed us in a unique place near campus
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.300]   so that we can be a witness,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.620]   so please pray for the church-like college ministry.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.960]   Pray for your coworkers by name.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.860]   Pray for those people,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.500]   instead of even the people that you may not know well,
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.740]   the non-Christians that you are in regular contact with,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.420]   pray for them specifically by name, right?
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.260]   Pray that God would open their hearts.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.460]   Pray specifically so that God would give you an opportunity,
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.780]   not to just pray from a distance,
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.460]   but ask the Lord to open the door,
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.780]   that you would have the courage
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.100]   to make an appointment with that person,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.180]   to sit with that person, to work with that person,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.260]   and be deliberate about sharing the gospel with that person.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.740]   So pray for that opportunity.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.800]   Pray for your heart, pray for courage on your part
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.100]   so that you may be a witness,
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.460]   and not just kind of spend day in and day out, you know,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.600]   and be satisfied that they know you're a Christian,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.380]   but actively, what kind of Christian are you, right?
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.940]   Do they know how important Christ is to you,
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.540]   or do they just know you're a Christian,
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.420]   so therefore you go to church on Sunday, right?
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.380]   So be deliberate, be proactive,
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.620]   and to pray specifically for those people by name.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.180]   Are there non-believers around you?
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.460]   Are there non-believers in your home?
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.320]   And I know that you've been praying for them,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.060]   and maybe some of you, because they haven't come to Christ,
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.140]   maybe some of you have been praying
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.720]   for a long period of time, to pray.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.000]   Pray with all your heart, right?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.080]   Pray with all your heart, pray out to God,
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.940]   because I know that if you have a non-Christian
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.360]   that you love in your home,
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.880]   there's probably nothing more important
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.180]   that you would pray for than them, right?
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.680]   But so pray with determination
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.560]   that God has to answer this prayer, right?
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   Like the way Jacob wrestled, like,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.720]   "I can't let you go until you answer this prayer,"
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.800]   to pray with fervency.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.920]   Pray for each one of them by name, right?
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.560]   And again, and then not just to pray for them,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.400]   pray that God would give you the courage
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   to be proactive to share the gospel with those people.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.940]   And then ultimately that God would use our church, right?
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.200]   During the pandemic, we had a lot of people
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.040]   who were coming to church,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.340]   and even now we have a lot of non-Christians
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.580]   who are being invited by our church members.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.980]   So there is a good chance that on Sunday,
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.460]   you may be sitting next to somebody
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.340]   who's not a Christian, right?
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.840]   So it's easy on Sunday just to kind of, you know,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.480]   go to our safety zone and see the people who are familiar
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.740]   and just gravitate toward them and spend that day
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.340]   talking with them and going home.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.260]   But, you know, we miss the opportunity
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.460]   to share the gospel with people
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.920]   when we attend church that way,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.220]   because there are non-Christians who are coming.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.740]   So pray specifically maybe for other people
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.780]   that some of you who know
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.680]   that there are non-Christians here, pray for them.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.120]   Pray for yourself, right?
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.140]   Don't leave the welcoming and outreach
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.740]   just to the welcoming committee.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.740]   That's something that the whole church needs to do.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.020]   The welcoming is just something
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.100]   that they are leading us in doing,
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.940]   but the calling for outreaching
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.880]   is something that God calls all of us to do, right?
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.020]   So pray for the outreach for the church,
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.820]   that we will be, that God would use us
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.080]   to spread the gospel and to spread it urgently,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.140]   that we do not go week after week
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.620]   thinking that we're gonna be here forever, right?
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.480]   So if you look at Apostle Paul's prayer,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.900]   there's always a sense of urgency.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.400]   He wanted to get the gospel out
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.500]   to as many people as possible, to as quickly as possible,
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.220]   that we would also have that sense of urgency
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.900]   and spread the gospel.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.180]   Globally, pray for Pastor Alex, Jen, and their children,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.380]   that while they're here,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.700]   they're gonna probably be here another eight, nine months,
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.100]   that God would use this time wisely,
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.340]   that they would not just be in a holding pattern,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.820]   but that they would learn to be fruitful here,
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.740]   use their time to be sober,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.580]   and that when they do go back to Taiwan,
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.440]   they will be refreshed and ready to go, right?
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.040]   Same thing with Harry and Linda.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.280]   As you've been, many of you are reading their newsletters,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.140]   they're very active in what they're doing over there.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.600]   They're kind of in a holding pattern
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.260]   until they go to China,
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.800]   but that God would cause them
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.540]   to be fruitful while they're there, okay?
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.720]   So pray for Harry and Linda.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.800]   Pray for the Indian pastors.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.160]   Pray for their protection, fruitfulness.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.480]   You know, I don't post up everything that I get from them
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.740]   for safety reasons, but they are,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.680]   they haven't skipped a beat, you know,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.480]   even though they're very challenged.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.800]   And if you've been reading the news,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.160]   I was reading a list of 10 countries
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.520]   where the COVID has made it very, very difficult,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.760]   where the persecution has intensified much more
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.520]   because of COVID, and India was on the top of that list.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.200]   And again, all of that is being confirmed by the pastors
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.160]   because the radical Hindus are using that as an excuse
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.600]   to attack the Christians,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.780]   and because the government is busy with COVID,
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.100]   they're just kind of sweeping it under the rug.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.500]   But the pastors and their families are, you know,
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.660]   are not any less active now than they were before, okay?
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.020]   So if you guys can continue to keep them in your prayer,
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.060]   keep them safe, to be bold and to be fruitful,
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.900]   and to plant more churches in the villages,
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.860]   if you can pray for them.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.540]   Pray for the missionaries in general.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.540]   Some of you guys may know other missionaries
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.340]   that maybe we're not aware of,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.460]   but this COVID has affected everybody.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.700]   So it's not just the missionaries in China,
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.280]   everyone had to kind of go back
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.000]   and they're all in the holding pattern, okay?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.900]   So that God would use these missionaries,
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.380]   not only for where they are,
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.880]   but wherever God sends them, that they will be fruitful,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.740]   and that this would be a reason and a cause
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.980]   for other people that may not have been reached
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.160]   because of this, but that God would use it for that purpose.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.220]   And then specifically pray
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.860]   for the persecuted brothers and sisters.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.980]   And I'm sure you've read as much as I did
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.340]   that the persecution around the world
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.080]   is increasing rapidly, right?
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.780]   We've been talking about what's going on here at home,
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.060]   and you could see what's going on here, right?
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.900]   But this is not unique to us.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.420]   This is going on all over the world.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.740]   And the Bible says that there's gonna be hatred
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.680]   toward Christians, and as the closer we get
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.860]   to the coming of Christ, persecution is going to increase.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.580]   And we're seeing that right now.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.940]   And so if you guys can keep that
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.180]   and pray for the churches, the leaders,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.660]   pray for all the Christians.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.740]   And so if you know people specifically by name,
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.900]   to take some time to pray for them specifically.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.980]   And then for your personal needs, okay?
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.860]   And I put that last for a reason, okay?
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.160]   Because sometimes we can get caught up
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.580]   in some of the things that we need to pray for,
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.180]   and we just kind of skim over the other things.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.940]   So get in the habit of praying for them.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.500]   And then for your personal needs, after the repentance,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.060]   your personal stuff, pray that you will be diligent
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.500]   to better prepare for the inductive Bible study coming up.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.140]   Those of you who are participating in that,
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.380]   that you don't just show up and then glean
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.260]   from what other people are doing.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.760]   The whole purpose of our Bible study
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.540]   is not to spoon feed you,
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.720]   but that you would learn how to eat for yourself.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.860]   So really ask God that you would prioritize your time
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.060]   to give the attention that the Word of God deserves,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.020]   and to really pray that God would help you to do that.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.540]   For your daily disciplines in the Word and prayer,
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.220]   if you are not in a regular pattern
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.100]   of praying and reading the Word,
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.020]   studying the Word on a daily basis,
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.660]   there is nothing else that you will do
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.620]   in your spiritual life that will revolutionize
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.140]   your spiritual life than doing that on a daily basis.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.120]   I guarantee it, okay?
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.260]   I'll give you a lollipop if I'm wrong, right?
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.060]   I mean, just from experience
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.000]   and years of just talking to people,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.180]   if you're not regularly praying, regularly reading,
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.260]   and intaking the Word of God,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.280]   there's nothing that you will do.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.260]   There's no retreat, there's no mission work,
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.340]   there's no friendship, there's no church that you will go to
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.980]   that will have a direct impact on your life
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.280]   than to do that first, okay?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.080]   So pray, if that's not a regular pattern, to do that,
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.620]   to pray and to be in the Word regularly.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.920]   And then to have the courage to live obediently, right?
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.140]   Again, as the pressure comes,
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.100]   it's easy for us to just compromise and just, you know,
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.420]   just don't obey fully and live comfortably,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.180]   but pray that God will give you courage
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.700]   to be able to live worthy of the gospel that He's given us.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.100]   And then finally, number five,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.980]   write down the prayer requests of others on the back.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.820]   So before we get started,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.780]   what I'm gonna ask you to do is to, again,
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.300]   I know we're in the middle of,
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.020]   like, we need to be socially distanced and all this stuff,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.180]   and so this is gonna be a little bit tricky, okay?
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.540]   But we're gonna do it anyway, okay?
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.060]   I'm gonna ask you to turn around.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.380]   Try not to move around too much,
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.580]   because again, we don't want too much movement,
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.420]   but take about four or five people around you,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.960]   maybe four, maybe five is too many,
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.860]   maybe about four people around you.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.920]   Ask them what their prayer request is, okay?
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.300]   So you're not gonna pray with them.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.580]   You're gonna pray for them, okay?
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.380]   So ask them, "What prayer request, how can I pray for you?"
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.780]   And then write their name,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.060]   write their prayer request down here,
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.260]   and then, so I'm only gonna give you
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.900]   about 10 minutes to do that,
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.820]   like, less than 10 minutes to do that.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.860]   Then after that, we're just gonna give you a chunk of time,
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.580]   about 30 minutes to pray, okay?
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.420]   Pray on your own.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.300]   So you guys can stay here.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.380]   You guys can go out, grab your chair, go outside.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.060]   You can spread out, okay?
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.100]   Don't go upstairs, 'cause there's people,
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   but you're welcome to grab your chairs and go outside,
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.560]   just to get away from people if you want, okay?
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.340]   So let me ask you to do this.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.620]   Take a few minutes, get their prayer request first,
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.940]   and then let me pray for you before you guys go, okay?
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.000]   So do that now, get prayer request.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.020]   You're not praying together.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.540]   You're only getting their prayer request, okay?
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:20.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:19.540]   Okay, about three more minutes.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.540]   We should be wrapping up.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.540]   Don't share your life stories.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.540]   If you're done, if you could just kinda look this way,
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   I'll know you're done.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.540]   (congregation chattering)
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:44:10.040]   Okay.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.040]   (congregation chattering)
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:27.540]   Okay, if you guys can look up here.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.540]   I wanna give you as much time to pray as possible.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   Okay.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:39.540]   All right, as I said, you guys can stay in this room,
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.540]   you guys can go outside, you can grab your chairs
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.540]   and walk outside and pray, but again,
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:51.540]   when you pray, if you pray generally,
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   it's hard to pray more than a few minutes
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.540]   because you can cover the whole topic of evangelism,
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.040]   Lord, let the gospel go out fast.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.540]   You're done, right?
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.040]   Pray for safety for the church, you're done, right?
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   So pray specifically, that's why I wrote this down
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.540]   specifically, so go down the list and pray specifically.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.540]   Don't just read the sentence, pray for them by name, okay?
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.540]   Some of you, like when I first learned how to pray,
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.040]   it was all just praying out loud, right?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   And that's kinda how the Korean church was,
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.540]   like we just prayed out loud, like we were screaming.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.040]   In fact, I was probably the loudest, right?
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   'Cause I had a lot to repent of every week.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   So when I first went to Biola, it was weird
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.540]   when they said let's pray, it was just 3,000 people
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.540]   just dead silence.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.040]   And so it took me a long time to figure out,
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.540]   it doesn't feel like prayer if I'm not crying out.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.040]   But as time went by, I realized there's also
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.540]   a benefit in meditation and prayer, right?
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.040]   To think deeply about what you're saying
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.540]   and actually having a conversation with God, right?
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.040]   But when you're having a hard time concentrating,
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.540]   it helps to pray out loud.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.040]   So I'm not saying you need to pray out loud, but it helps.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   If you're thinking about that stock,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.540]   if you're thinking about some movie,
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.040]   if you're thinking about some trip you're taking
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.540]   and then just like constantly, every two seconds,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.040]   that's all you're thinking about,
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.540]   it helps to pray out loud, okay?
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   So I'm not asking you to like scream or anything,
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.540]   but sometimes like causing you to speak,
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.540]   like you're talking to somebody else in front of you,
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.540]   it helps you to pray.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   So if you wanna pray quietly, right?
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.540]   And to be honest, I enjoy praying quietly
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.040]   more now than I did before, you know,
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.040]   just 'cause I want my mind engaged in all of it.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.540]   But again, there are times when praying out loud
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   definitely helps me to pray more in depth
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   and longer periods of time, okay?
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:50.040]   So however you pray, I want you to learn
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.540]   how to wrestle in prayer today, right?
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   Don't give up after a few minutes.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.540]   Don't give up because, oh, I have nothing more to pray, right?
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.540]   It just means you're distracted.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.540]   But fight with that, right?
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.540]   Just like Jesus told his disciples,
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   you know, they were sleepy, of course they're sleepy,
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.540]   they had a huge meal.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.540]   But he said, no, this is important enough
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.540]   that you need to wrestle in prayer, watch and pray.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.540]   And so we really need to learn how to do that, right?
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.540]   If you're, oh, I'm so tired, it's like,
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.540]   tell me when you're not tired when you wanna pray.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   Don't you always get tired when you wanna pray?
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   So you need to learn to fight the fatigue.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   You need to learn, if you get up, drink something,
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.540]   go to the bathroom, come back.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.540]   So wrestle in prayer today, okay?
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   Fight against your fatigue,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.540]   fight against your mind wandering with something else,
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:40.540]   and to really come before God and to wrestle in prayer, okay?
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.540]   So even if you felt like, man, I'm so tired
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   after 40 minutes or 30 minutes of prayer,
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   those 30, 40 minutes of wrestling in prayer,
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   think of it as a workout, right?
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.540]   Not a second of that would be wasted, right?
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:57.540]   And hopefully that we continue to do that
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.540]   and then we learn how to pray.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540]   So let me pray for us.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.540]   And then right now it's 8.15.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.540]   If I can, I'm gonna call you back here at 8.50.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.540]   So it's about 35 minutes, okay?
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   So again, it's praise and prayer, not praise and share.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.540]   So don't spend the rest of 15 minutes going around
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   saying, hey, I wanna, you didn't get to finish your thing,
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.540]   so I wanna talk more to you.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   So if you didn't get it,
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   just pray for the people that's on your card, okay?
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:28.540]   'Cause I want you to take more time to pray, okay?
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   So let me pray for us and I'm gonna dismiss you
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   and then we're gonna have music playing
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.540]   and then again, in 35 minutes, we'll be back here.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.540]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   Heavenly Father, we wanna learn how to pray.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.540]   Teach us, Lord God.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.540]   We know mentally, we know because of your word
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   and we believe, Father God,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   that we are helpless without you.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   So teach us how to pray, Father God.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   Teach us how to persevere in prayer.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.540]   I pray that you would help us to use the prayer muscles,
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   Lord God, to come before your throne,
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   that you would give us a sense of urgency, Lord God,
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   in the things that we pray.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.540]   I pray for our brothers and sisters who are fatigued
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.540]   because of a long day.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.540]   Lord, I pray that you would give them soberness, alertness,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   that our corporate prayer, Father God,
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.540]   for one another would strengthen our church
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.540]   in ways that we could tangibly see.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.540]   And so we pray for guidance, we pray for your Holy Spirit
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.540]   to empower us and move us,
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   that we would engage in this spiritual battle tonight
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   together, Father God,
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   that with all the things that are going around,
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.540]   we know, Father, that we do not wrestle
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   against flesh and blood,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.540]   but against principalities and powers, Lord God.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.540]   So we pray that as we pray, that you would open our eyes
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.540]   to see the spiritual battle that we're in,
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   the demonic forces that are around us, Father God,
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   hindering your work.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.540]   So we ask, Lord, that you would guide us
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   and teach us how to pray tonight.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.540]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.540]   Okay.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.540]   Okay, we'll see you guys in about 30 minutes.

[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.540]   All right, if you guys can stand with me for the final praise.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.540]   But before we do that, I'm gonna pray for us and finish,
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.540]   and then we're gonna let the last thing we do end with praise.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:12.540]   I hope your spiritual muscles are sore tomorrow, okay?
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:17.540]   So again, I know some of you guys may have been struggling through prayer,
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:21.540]   and I can hear the chairs wiggling about 15 minutes into it
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   because some of you guys are struggling, but that's a good thing,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.540]   that you're wrestling through that, wrestling through your fatigue,
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.540]   and when you get in the habit of keep doing that,
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.540]   your prayer life, you'll see it getting strengthened, right?
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.540]   If you're in the habit of quitting, as soon as it gets harder,
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.540]   you're fatigued and you can't concentrate, that's gonna be a pattern also.
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:45.540]   So hopefully that, again, as we said that we want to be a church
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.540]   that is genuinely committed to prayer, that this is something
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.540]   that will kind of continue to go down this path.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.540]   And again, not just when we're gathered together.
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.540]   We gather together to do this because we want to encourage you
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.540]   to do this when you're alone, to get in the habit.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.540]   So now that we've kind of wrestled through in prayer,
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.540]   I know some of you guys, 30 minutes is nothing.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.540]   Some of you guys have prayed like that before.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.540]   Some of you guys, this may be the longest time you've prayed continuously.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.540]   So my encouragement to you is when you go home, set aside time,
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:18.540]   whether it's at office or maybe in your car or maybe just somewhere else,
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.540]   Tuesday or Wednesday here in the morning,
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.540]   to come here and really learn how to pray and wrestle.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:29.540]   And so let me pray for us and then our worship team is going to lead
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.540]   and then after that Pastor Peter is going to make an announcement.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:57.540]   [Pastor Peter speaking]
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.540]   So we're getting rid of all the chairs?

[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.540]   We're putting it all in like first?
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:06.540]   Okay.
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:11.540]   All right, let me pray for us and then we'll finish with the closing praise.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:17.540]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for giving us opportunity to pray.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:22.540]   We know that more than anything else that we do,
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:25.540]   coming before you and asking your help, Father God,
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.540]   is the best use of our time.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:34.540]   I pray that you would open our eyes to be able to see things through your lens.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:37.540]   Lord, we're of the flesh.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:44.540]   Lord, we live just day to day, Father God, forgetting, entangled,
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.540]   trying to take care of our families, paying bills,
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.540]   things that are going on at work and at home.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.540]   But in the midst of all of these things, Lord God, that distract us,
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:00.540]   help us, Lord God, as we pray to have an eternal perspective.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   Teach us what it means to truly be broken for the lost.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:09.540]   What does it mean, Lord God, to pray with tears, Lord God,
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.540]   because we desire to see these souls saved,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.540]   even the ones that we do not know.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:21.540]   So help us, Lord God, to live by faith and not by sight.
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:29.540]   Teach us this year specifically as we desire to be a church that really prays.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.540]   Lord, though we are weak, make us strong,
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.540]   that we may be vessels used for your kingdom.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:15.540]   Child of weakness, watch and pray.

[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:17.540]   can change the land of spots and melt the heart of stone.
