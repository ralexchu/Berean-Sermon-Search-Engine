[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   Alright everyone, we're going to gather our attention to the front and go through our
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.780]   passage.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.400]   So what I'll do is I'll read our passage in full and then we'll jump right in.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.920]   Starting from verse 12, it says, "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.280]   not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   fear and trembling.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   For it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.560]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing, so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.240]   and innocent children of God, above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.280]   among whom you appear as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.240]   So that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory, because I do not run in vain nor
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.120]   toil in vain, but even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.600]   and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.160]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.080]   Alright God, we thank you so much.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.240]   Lord, we do pray that we would understand in this grand scale the great purpose to which
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600]   you have called us.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.360]   God to share in the glories of Christ, to be used the proclamation of his name, and
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.240]   God to experience the privilege and the joy of being called children of our God.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.960]   And we do pray God that with great sense of appreciation, sense of privilege, Lord we
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.600]   would desire really to experience that in our lives.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.800]   God, we thank you for your word, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   Amen.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   Okay.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.080]   So as we look at this passage, I'd like to first take a moment to break the passage
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   down.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.960]   I already put it into chunks for you, but a good practice is to make sure that as we're
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   understanding the flow of thought, to summarize what those chunks are.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.000]   Now one of the easiest ways to do that is just to make sure we look at the sentences
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.040]   as a complete package.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.200]   So in terms of an outline, this is the way I wrote it out.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   Okay.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.480]   Here in verse 12 to 13, reading it again it says, "So then my beloved, just as you have
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.560]   always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.680]   salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is at work in you, both to will
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120]   and to work for his good pleasure."
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   Okay.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.760]   And what I'm going to say is that as we take a look at that sentence as a whole, you take
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.840]   a look at the main, main command or the main verb in that sentence, and it's the command
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.040]   to work out your salvation.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.560]   What's more, the second part of it, command is right there at the front.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.000]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you will prove yourself to be blameless
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.040]   and innocent, children of God above reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.600]   among whom you appear as lights in the world.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.360]   So that, I summarize as do all without grumbling or disputing.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640]   Ha ha ha.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   Okay.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   Just making sure you're paying attention.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.640]   All right.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   All right.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   Verse 17 through 18, he says that, you know, "Do this so that in the day of Christ I will
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.880]   have reason to glory, because I do not run in vain or toil in vain, but even if I am
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.320]   being poured out as a drink offering upon sacrifice in service of your faith, I rejoice
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.160]   and share my joy with you all."
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   So that phrase, "I rejoice and share my joy," is the main clause.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   And that second part in verse 18, that is actually a command.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.600]   It is in the imperative form, "You too, I urge you, rejoice."
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.040]   So the command is there, "You rejoice."
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760]   And then he says, "Share your joy with me."
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   So that's why I summarized it as, "I rejoice, you rejoice, we all rejoice for ice cream."
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   That's good.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.640]   Not for ice cream, but for the sake of Christ.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   Okay?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.380]   Now, I want to highlight this just a little bit as good practice.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.320]   I'm not going to take a whole lot, but typically when I read a passage, I read through it multiple
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.680]   times before I make the outline.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.960]   You have to, right?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.400]   But sometimes the act of trying to summarize it to the core point is difficult.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   How do you find that?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.860]   I want to give you an example of verse 12 to 13.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.040]   My whole point to you is going to be you have to find the main sentence out of the thought,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.120]   okay, out of the main point out of the sentence.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.460]   And how you do that is you realize certain phrases cannot stand alone.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   If I read to you, "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed."
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.940]   That is not a complete sentence.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.580]   You learned that in like first grade, right?
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.460]   It is called a subjective clause.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.460]   It can't stand alone.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.460]   So guess what?
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.420]   You can just remove that for a little bit.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.660]   And then it says, "Not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence."
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.540]   If you leave it there, it doesn't make sense.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.540]   You remove that too.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.760]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, period, right?
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.840]   There's your command.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   It's your independent clause, okay?
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.180]   And that's how you get to the main thought of the sentence.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.520]   The other part, "For it is God," that also cannot stand alone.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so if you remove it, what you have is work out your salvation.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   There's your central thought to your sentence.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.560]   If you want to get all crazy, I put a diagram there.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.060]   This is the way when I prepare a sermon, not for my own personal devotion, but for the
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   way I prepare a sermon, this is the way I break it down.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.260]   And if you've ever wondered why in the world do some pastors take one sentence and preach
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.300]   an hour-long sermon, it's because you can get so much from breaking it down.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.420]   For example, I recognize that these clauses that can't stand alone all point to the centerpiece,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.120]   which is the command.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.540]   But the relationship is where I can preach, meaning I can show you what He means.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.840]   Just as you've always obeyed, and immediately you're like, "Oh, shoot.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.020]   These people always obeyed.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   Not me."
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.620]   All of a sudden, you have a sermon right there, right?
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.700]   "You don't always obey, do you?"
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   Right?
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.700]   Like, "There's my sermon."
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   I can preach.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.700]   I can preach that.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.460]   What's more, when it says, "Work out your salvation," I can even go on to this, "How
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.720]   did you obey?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.660]   Not only in my presence, but much more in my absence."
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   Ooh.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.940]   When we think about even young kids, how many of them pretend like they're obeying, but
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.780]   as soon as a parent turns the eye, they're like, "Ha, ha, ha, ha."
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.780]   Right?
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.340]   I've got examples now, right?
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.540]   And then when I think about, "With fear and trembling," wow.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.260]   How you're supposed to work out your salvation is with fear and trembling.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.860]   And so you can see how each portion of that sentence can be broken down, and the relationships
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.420]   of the phrases all matter.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.660]   Now, this could take you forever.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.140]   However, I don't expect you guys to do this on a daily devotional basis, but sometimes
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.240]   if you want to, you can dig that closely.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.780]   My main point to you was, when you think about finding the main sentence, you realize you
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.500]   can look at each phrase and just simply ask, "Can this stand alone?"
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.580]   And when you realize the stand-alone sentence has the main subject and verb, here it's clearly
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.300]   you work out your salvation, right?
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.620]   There you have a kind of summary of that little section.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.220]   Hope that's helpful, okay?
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.220]   All right.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.900]   So, that being said, that was a quick overview of the passage, but now we ask this kind of
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.580]   review and introductory question, a connection with the past, a connection with last week.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.060]   What is the flow of thought from the previous passage?
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.760]   Okay, I asked you that question.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.980]   And what you need to do is you got to realize, "Okay, I got to start reviewing."
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.340]   I remember that in the very beginning, Apostle Paul was super thankful for this church, right?
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.340]   He's like, "I ought to be thankful for you because," and then we recognize that there
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.820]   was faith, love, hope, all the genuine marks of Christianity.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:14.220]   But what's more, Apostle Paul shared that he had this prayer and desire for the church.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.820]   He says, "And I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.900]   all discernment, so that you may approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.540]   and blameless until the day of Christ, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.020]   which comes through Jesus."
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.540]   Now why is this important?
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.140]   It's because you realize Apostle Paul is, yes, writing this letter and it's one whole
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.600]   piece.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.420]   You do realize the flow of thought where he has this main objective for the church, and
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.700]   therefore the commands of you follow his example, have his attitude, all of that comes into
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700]   play.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.180]   What's more, Apostle Paul did share his own personal perspective.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.620]   He shared his mentality and one main passion, and he talked about how to live is Christ,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:14.020]   to live is just amazing because it's all Christ, but to die is even more Christ, so it's gain.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.740]   And if you remember in verse 20, chapter 1 verse 20, he said, "According to my earnest
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.620]   expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:30.660]   Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death, for
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.020]   to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.500]   And we spent a long portion, and the whole portion is from like verse 12 through 30,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.820]   talking about this is Apostle Paul's mentality that helps him interpret everything in life,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:53.180]   his suffering, his work, his pains, his burdens, and he's like, "Dude, in all that I will rejoice
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.220]   because my one objective is Christ's exaltation."
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:04.660]   And so last week we heard Apostle Paul's command where he connects that and says, "Therefore
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:10.220]   if there's any marks of genuine faith and experience," remember he talked about how
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.540]   if there was any encouragement in Christ, if there's any consolation of love, any fellowship,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.780]   right, you remember all that?
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.700]   He says, "If that's all true, be united."
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.220]   Same mind, intent on one purpose, and he says, "How are you going to do that?
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:31.860]   By being humble and having the attitude of Christ, who emptied himself and became obedient
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.340]   to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.980]   I highlight that because now I want to show you his flow of thought is all the way from
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.900]   the very beginning of the letter.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.060]   He had his intentions for you to be blameless in Christ.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.440]   He wants you to understand what it is to truly live and die well in Christ.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:11:00.740]   He wants you to be obedient like Christ, following his example, and therefore he says, "So then,"
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.940]   and that's what I'm coming to is.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.100]   The passage that we have today begins with the "so then," and it points to all of that,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   okay?
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:15.100]   It points to the example of Christ where he has emptied himself and Scripture says has
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.060]   become obedient, right?
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:26.260]   He became obedient even unto death, even death on a cross, and therefore you too, just as
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.920]   you obey, right?
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.840]   So here we jump into verse 12 through 13.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.700]   Section one, "So therefore you ought to obey and work out your salvation and do everything
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.440]   without grumbling," okay?
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   That's the flow.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.640]   That's the flow.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.060]   So here in verse 12 he says, "So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.280]   in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.460]   and trembling, for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.640]   pleasure."
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.420]   This is the first section.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.900]   And in here what we find is I'm just going to briefly mention just because we don't have
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.900]   time to go over every phrase, that when he says, "Just as you have always obeyed," I
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.460]   always make sure that when I see these comparative words, I ask myself, "What's he comparing?
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.900]   Is he comparing like, just like Jesus obeyed?
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   Just like I obeyed?
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.860]   Or just like you obeyed?"
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.860]   And just like what?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.340]   Like what are you comparing?
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.780]   And he's not actually pointing to something before, he's actually pointing to the command,
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.780]   okay?
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:38.180]   He's pointing to the command and saying, as an introductory, "Look, I commend you because
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:47.620]   you are a healthy church that is already striving and obeying, persevering through trials.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.420]   And even when I'm not here, you're showing your fruitfulness by obeying."
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.900]   And again, immediately I'm sitting here like, "Yeah, yeah, me too."
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   I'm just kidding.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.180]   I didn't say that when I was studying, but I'm just thinking like, already that's a point
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   of conviction, right?
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:09.140]   I mean, how many of us can say like, every time we hear like some kind of admonition
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.820]   or exhortation, it's in the context of, "I'm already doing well and I've already been listening
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.100]   hard," and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.140]   What a challenge for us to be like this church.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.180]   Or on the flip side, you could have guilty feelings like, "Oh yeah, honestly speaking,
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.900]   that's really convicting because I actually really need to get it together."
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.900]   You know?
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.900]   Like, which one is it?
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.460]   Now, moving forward, the main point of it though in that first section is the command.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.500]   I like to put my commands in purple.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.540]   And it says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.620]   And you guys know, I'm sure you guys did it in your groups.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.100]   We can sit there and start asking all these questions like, "Wow, what does that mean?
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.340]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.140]   And each one of those terms, actually, you can sit down, camp out, and start asking all
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.340]   these questions.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.820]   What does work mean?
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.300]   What does salvation mean?
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.300]   What does fear mean?
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.220]   And what does trembling mean?
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.220]   Why?
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.940]   Because to the normal person in modern day Christianity, if you hear these words, "Work
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.380]   out your salvation with fear and trembling," they're going to automatically think like,
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.540]   "That don't sound like the gospel."
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.020]   Right?
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:24.900]   You can imagine your average American Christian thinking like, "Does that sound a lot like
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.260]   you have to accomplish your salvation?
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.060]   You're responsible for making it work?
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.060]   In the end, it's up to you?"
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.380]   I mean, what's it trying to say?
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.820]   Is it talking just about general sanctification?
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.420]   Is it talking about like, "There's suffering out there, so work hard."
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.700]   And then reach the end, what is it talking about?
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.700]   Right?
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.900]   Now, I do want to just first say, here where it says, "Work out your salvation," it is
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.300]   incredibly emphatic.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   Right?
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.880]   Because you notice like all the various things he's pointing to with it.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.820]   He's pointing to it with the, "Just like you're doing this always before."
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:10.300]   And what's more, he's giving the "for," like, "because," and there's motivation behind it.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.460]   And what's more, just the term itself.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.140]   So again, if you guys are, if you have time to do word study, just give it a look.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.020]   I want to recommend again, we talked about it in a previous session.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.140]   A nice little website is blueletterbible.org.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.140]   Okay?
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.140]   Blueletterbible.org.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.420]   It just gives you the words and you click on a word and it shows you the definition.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.420]   It's great.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   Okay?
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.500]   But it's an intensified word because the normal word for work is just simply, "Goedzo mai."
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:45.540]   However, it has the word "kata" to intensify that term and that's why for one word you
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.460]   have two words like this, you got to work it out.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.460]   It's this idea of making sure it comes to completion.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.660]   Right?
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.260]   Now, without belaboring the point about what does this mean, I just want to share with
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.100]   you sometimes it's good for us to just ask, "What could this mean?
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.100]   What are the possible interpretations here?"
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.460]   Another good question to ask, "Are there hints in the immediate passage that tell you
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.100]   what kind of interpretation it could be?
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.540]   Is he talking about the extreme case?
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.180]   It's up to you.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.740]   Salvation is in your hand.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.740]   Do it!"
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   Right?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740]   Is that what it's saying?
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.280]   Is that what it's talking about?
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.300]   You got to ask the questions in the immediate context, what is he talking about?
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:34.660]   What's more, you got to ask the question in the context of the Bible, how are we to understand
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.940]   this in other passages, right?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:43.620]   First, first, I want to draw our attention to the fact that there is this general sentiment
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.100]   of obedience in this passage.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:54.740]   Remember, Apostle Paul is telling us you need to have the attitude of Jesus Christ, who,
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.180]   and he gives a list of all the things Jesus did, and within that he says, "And Jesus
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.140]   became obedient, and therefore just like you are obeying," and what's more, he connects
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.100]   it with, "So then you," right?
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.180]   What I'm saying is this is still a continuation of Apostle Paul's expectation that we would
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.660]   follow Christ's example, right?
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.100]   Follow Christ's example.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.860]   But what's more, I want us to turn to a passage, 2 Peter 1, verse 5-11.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.580]   It clearly gives us in another passage of the Bible generally what the scripture means
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.300]   when your salvation needs to continue to take its whole effect.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.340]   And Pastor Peter in the Sunday sermons has been regular, like multiple times explaining
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.380]   that if you have such a narrow vision and understanding of salvation that it's just
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:50.140]   a one-time moment of justification, you only have part of the picture because clearly the
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:56.660]   Bible talks about the entirety of God's redemptive plan for you as the whole of salvation.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:02.860]   Your justification, your changed transformation and sanctification, and your ultimate change
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.860]   in your glorification.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.260]   On all of that, God is redeeming you, right?
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.180]   Now here is a passage, 2 Peter 1, verse 5-11.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:19.760]   Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, okay?
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.200]   Applying all your diligence, in your faith supply more excellence.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.860]   In your moral excellence, knowledge, and in your knowledge, self-control.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.900]   In your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.000]   And in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.280]   For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither useless nor unfruitful
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.140]   in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.440]   I want you to understand what he's talking about there.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.380]   Notice, there is both the concepts of your diligence and you applying yourself, but within
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.420]   it he says, this is the application of your faith.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.340]   This is the true knowledge.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.140]   What's more, verse 9, "For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.260]   forgotten his purification from his former sins.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:14.020]   Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling in choosing
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.020]   you.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.200]   For as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.840]   For in this way, the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.040]   will be abundantly supplied to you."
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.780]   So when you hear this, it makes all the more sense, right?
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.380]   Because the work we're supposed to do is to take the faith that God has given us.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:42.360]   When he opens our eyes to see the spiritual reality, "God is holy," and you look like,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.400]   "I'm sinful.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.560]   There's Jesus, glorious Savior, who died on the cross."
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.440]   Those are spiritual moments of having your eyes opened by God.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.600]   He's saying when that knowledge is there, it needs to have its fruit.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.340]   So clearly, Scripture tells you, "Bear fruit.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.340]   Apply what you know."
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.340]   Right?
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.320]   Walk in a manner that's in accordance to the faith that you have.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.880]   It's pretty much exactly the same thing.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.200]   And in all honesty, I think sometimes we just continue to overcomplicate simple things.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.480]   What do I mean by this?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.440]   Somebody is going to come and ask you, "Hey, when this passage says, 'Work out your salvation,'
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.400]   does it mean like that your works have merit?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.640]   Is Catholicism correct?
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.560]   Like, do you have – is it a combo of your work and faith together?"
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.880]   Someone could ask that kind of question, right?
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.760]   You need to have an answer for that.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.600]   And let me make it simple.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.120]   If you make it a doctrinal debate about works' merits, like who works, God or you?
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.480]   What value does your work have?
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.800]   How does your works apply to God's redemption?
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.420]   It's going to be very hard.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.320]   But Scripture has made it really, really clear to you.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.200]   What do I mean?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.840]   Here I want you to understand that there is a lot of talk of your identity as a child
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.560]   of God.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.960]   Jesus was the prime son of God, and as you have been given the grace of salvation in
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   the gospel to be adopted into God's household, Scripture is really clear.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.580]   If you're now a child of God, stop obeying Satan, especially stop obeying yourself.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:30.600]   If you have been adopted by God and he is your father, be a good child.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.640]   Obey your father.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.120]   That's it.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.240]   If that is who you are, you have this amazing calling to be inducted into his household,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.960]   what kind of doctrinal debate is there?
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   It's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   Am I working for…"
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   No.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:51.760]   The whole picture is you and God brought together in a father-son, father-daughter relationship.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.880]   In that context, Christianity has always been childlike obedience.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.800]   "I trust my God.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.160]   I do what he says.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   He instructs.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.920]   I follow."
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.200]   When did we make it all complicated talking about, "Wait a minute.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.640]   Are we talking about the doctrine of works-based righteousness?
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   Are we talking…"
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.440]   It's as simple as that.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.160]   And I think as we work through the passage, we're going to see that that's how Apostle
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.040]   Paul talks too.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:26.280]   That as we obey, we're going to prove ourselves, show ourselves, reveal the spiritual truth,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.160]   "You're a child of God."
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   It's that simple.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   Okay?
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:37.480]   Now, I think that's why the fear and trembling, and it's the "For it is God who is at
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.040]   work in you," all make sense.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:48.840]   When I read to you 2 Peter 1, I tried to emphasize to you, all Peter was trying to say was, "Look,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.760]   if you have true knowledge, if you have true faith, you're going to be fruitful in these
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   ways."
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.080]   Likewise, just think about this.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.500]   Forget all the preconceptions you have of trembling.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.640]   Forget all the preconceptions you have of like fear, right?
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:13.480]   And just ask the question, "If God walked into this room, how would you feel?"
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:20.280]   If I told you, if I told you, even if it wasn't even God, but some other figure with a lot
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:26.280]   of power, perhaps it was the governor, perhaps it was somebody who was a statesman, perhaps
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.040]   it was an owner of a massive business, and I told you, "Ooh, they're in the room,"
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.200]   you would already have a sense of like, "Oh, really?"
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.600]   Your sense of awe goes up, right?
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.120]   All we're saying, all he's saying is, "Work out your salvation with clear understanding
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.240]   of the reality of God.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.040]   He's working in you."
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.400]   Of course there should be fear and trembling.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   I think we have this weird reaction to this passage because we have a lot of negative
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.240]   preconceptions to fear and trembling.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   What do I mean by that?
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.960]   I'm going to read you a passage.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.640]   In Isaiah chapter 66, verse 2, okay?
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.440]   Isaiah 66, verse 2, please just read this.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.200]   I'm sorry, please just listen to this.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   I'll read it.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.560]   "For," God says, "for my hand made all these things."
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560]   God is the creator.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.080]   "Thus all these things came into being, declares the Lord.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.320]   But to this one I will look, to him who is humble and contrite of spirit, who trembles
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   at my word."
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.960]   What does God say?
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.560]   He carefully looks.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.800]   He is pleased by the one who trembles at his word.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.720]   It's not a negative term.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.120]   It's not a term of like, "Oh my gosh, that means it's anti-gospel."
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.440]   No, it's not.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.760]   It means you appropriately saw him.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.240]   Just like 1 John tells you, if you do not love, you probably have not seen God.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.400]   If you do not have an awe and sense of reverence for God, as heavenly Father, creator of the
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.440]   world, that also means you've kind of forgotten who he is.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.060]   All right, so that's section one, okay?
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.840]   Section one, in thinking about the work out your salvation, the fear and trembling is
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   you appropriately seeing, accurately seeing, and intimately seeing him as Father.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.200]   That all comes together with knowing if he's at work in you, it all the more inspires you
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.080]   to be that much more diligent in your sanctification, okay?
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   Next passage.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:30.320]   All right, in this next passage, he says, "Do all things without grumbling or disputing
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.400]   so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.280]   in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.560]   holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ, I will have reason to glory
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.760]   because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain."
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.240]   Oops, I put that into the next section.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.880]   Okay, when I look at this, the first part is really clear.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.280]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing, and I put stars by those terms because you
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.240]   could easily ask, "Wait, does that mean that Christians should never disagree?"
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.760]   If you're at work and your boss tells you, "Hey, I know you're already kind of overworked,
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.380]   but can you stay another three hours?"
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.240]   Are you supposed to say, "Yes, sir," right?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.360]   Is that the good and godly Christian thing to do?
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.960]   I mean, can you never say, "No, thank you," right?
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.040]   "I'm going to go home now."
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.560]   Can you never do that?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.340]   If someone says like, "Hey, our plan is to execute by doing A, B, and C," but you see
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.760]   it coming like, "B is going to fail, C is going to fail, and we're going to waste a
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:37.040]   whole lot of time," are you supposed to be like, "Got to hold my tongue because Jesus
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.840]   said don't ever dispute," right?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.040]   I mean, is that the way we're supposed to respond?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.840]   Again, I want to encourage you guys to do word studies sometimes, especially, it doesn't
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.200]   have to be every single word, but as soon as you feel like, "He gave me a command, but
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.320]   I need to know the parameters," right?
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.000]   Couple things I want to say.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   I'm not going to, let's say, bore you with all the nuanced details, but clearly grumbling
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.300]   has more to do with that complaining spirit.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.720]   It's not just arguing with somebody.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.960]   What's really interesting, it's a vivid term that actually means murmuring to yourself.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:20.040]   Have you guys ever been so disappointed, like you got into maybe some kind of disagreement,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.200]   you had your fair chance to state your case, and then nobody listened to you?
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.440]   You could do one of two things.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440]   You know what?
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.180]   I stated my piece, I gave my reasons, but we're going to go this way.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.000]   Or you can sit there and be like, "Those little guys never listened to me," you know, and
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.720]   you start talking to yourself, you sound like a crazy person, and you have this discontent
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   in your heart.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Guess what?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.120]   This term, in other portions of the Bible, is translated discontent.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.960]   You're so unhappy.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.120]   What's more, disputing, very interesting.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.760]   It's not just the fact that you disagree.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.160]   When you have a disputing heart, typically what happens, it's not just like, "Hey, objectively
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.060]   speaking, this plan doesn't work because of X, Y, and Z."
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.040]   If you've ever gotten in an argument, and you became a disputing person, no longer do
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.200]   you argue based on facts or truth.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.440]   All of a sudden, you're like, "Well, you know what?
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440]   You're just stupid."
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   Right?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   Have you guys ever done that?
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   Of course not, right?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   You guys are...
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   I'm just kidding.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.280]   Now, the thing about it is, if you ever get there, now you know you're not just disputing
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   anymore.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.820]   You're not just disagreeing, I mean.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:34.040]   What you're having is this heart of putting down the other individual, not trusting them.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.440]   And when you apply it to God, it's actually very dangerous, isn't it?
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.480]   For you to be so discontent, you've maybe asked them the questions, maybe you've prayed,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.000]   but you're so discontent, now you're not even talking to Him anymore, you're just talking
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   to yourself.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   "This is horrible, I can't believe you did this, blah, blah, blah."
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.760]   And then the disputing happens when all of a sudden now, the fact of the matter is, if
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.940]   you have this spirit against somebody, you don't trust their plans.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.880]   You don't trust their competence.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.960]   And if we did this to God, you recognize how dangerous this could be.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.000]   And I want to highlight that a little bit because other parts of Scripture tell us emphatically,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.580]   "Don't do this!
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.440]   Turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 10, verse 8-11."
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.360]   Ooh, I'm already at a solid 30 minutes.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:29.000]   Okay, 1 Corinthians 10, verse 8-13.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.520]   In 1 Corinthians, Apostle Paul is describing how like, "Hey, you guys remember how all
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.480]   have gone through the same?"
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.880]   He's talking about the wilderness generation.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.640]   They crossed the sea, they were baptized through.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   And he says, "These people are for your instruction, they're an example to you."
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Negative.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.360]   Verse 8, he says, "Don't do this!
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.880]   Don't let us act immorally as some of them did.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.520]   23,000 fell in one day.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.360]   Nor let us try the Lord.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.960]   Don't test Him as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.880]   Nor," here's our key term, "Don't grumble as some of them did and were destroyed by
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.120]   the destroyer.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.720]   These things happened to them as an example that they were written for our instruction
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.480]   Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall."
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.240]   Guys, this is just a common temptation for every man.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.520]   You're walking through the desert, you're all of a sudden all mad.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.520]   What in the world?
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.800]   We're walking through the desert, I have no water, I have no food, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   blah.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.080]   And we just came out of slavery and they were beating us to death.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   Right?
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.160]   We can't be like that.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   And so you recognize how important it is and how dangerous it is for us to think that grumbling,
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:47.000]   being discontent, dissatisfied, and distrusting God, we sometimes think it's okay.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.040]   It's not.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   Absolutely not.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:55.280]   As a matter of fact, in order to highlight for you how important this is, notice how
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.160]   he talks about do all these things without grumbling or disputing, and then he talks
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.360]   about how in contrast, you're supposed to be this blameless, innocent children above
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.800]   reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:15.560]   He's contrasting this wicked generation and he says, "You know what the difference is?
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.480]   You've got these blameless individuals who don't complain, who don't grumble.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.720]   And I'm going to ask you these questions that you should be talking about in your groups.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.760]   How is it that not grumbling or vice versa, grumbling show you to be a perverse person?
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.080]   Or when you don't grumble, it shows you to be an innocent person?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   Why?
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.420]   Because take a look at this.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:46.960]   He says, "Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you prove yourselves
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.760]   to be blameless, innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.320]   perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.440]   I want to give you this challenge.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:06.280]   If you do complain and grumble quite often, do you see it as such a heinous thing?
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.640]   Such an important and significant thing?
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.400]   You should ask yourself, how does God see grumbling?
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.060]   How does it go against our identity as blameless and innocent people?
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.200]   How does it go against our identity as children of God?
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.920]   Typically speaking, again, when we think about disputing or having a discontent heart, ultimately,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:35.200]   are we not pridefully accusing God, "You're not doing what I think is right."
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.440]   Right?
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.880]   It is a pretty incredibly prideful position and posture before God.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.160]   "God, you're wrong.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   I think I have a better way."
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:52.680]   Ultimately, the platform for us to grumble and dispute against the Lord is that fashion.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.560]   And sometimes we're so stubborn in it.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.800]   If God says, "No, you have to do this," then we say something like, "Fine.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.320]   And since I can't have a good attitude about it, I'm out."
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.720]   Notice brothers and sisters that the command is to do all things.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.880]   What am I saying?
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.320]   I find that sometimes when people know what they ought to do, when people know what is
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.160]   the right thing to do, sometimes they say, "Well, if I can't be genuine about it, if
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.400]   I can't have a good attitude, better for me to sit out."
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.240]   Brothers and sisters, that's also wrong.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:30.560]   The passage tells you to do all things actually with joy.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.040]   The higher calling for us is to go above and beyond that.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   Right?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.240]   If you've ever been tempted, you don't like something, you don't like the way things are
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   going and you're tempted to excuse yourself and you think that's more nobler than being
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.320]   in it all grouchy, yes, there is a point to it.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.720]   But the Scripture calls us to much more.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   That's my point.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   Okay?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:57.280]   Now, this next portion, I'm going to go a little bit faster, which is this idea.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.640]   This portion I'm going to leave to you to discuss in your group.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.320]   The passage has this interesting concept and flow of thought.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   You need to be like these individuals who do things with great joy, with rejoicing,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.480]   with the great purpose of God so that you prove yourselves to be all these things.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.300]   And I ask you this question, how does grumbling prove one or the other?
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.440]   It proves yourself to be crooked and perverse or by not grumbling, it proves yourself to
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.200]   be these things.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.300]   Please discuss that in your group.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.440]   Now we go to the last section and we're going to go through a little bit quickly.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:37.040]   And he says, "I want you to make sure to do these things, to make sure that you work out
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:43.220]   your salvation, to make sure that you're doing all things not with grumbling but with joy
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.200]   so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.520]   toil in vain.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.440]   But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.400]   your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.280]   You too I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   Okay?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.220]   Now, what I'm going to say is, it is kind of interesting.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.720]   I would definitely say like, hmm, this is a little bit of a, you got to think through
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.720]   it because earlier on in chapter 1 verse 6, he talks about how, "I'm so confident, so
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.440]   confident that he who began this thing, he's going to bring it upon completion.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.640]   I'm so confident of you."
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   Right?
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.800]   And it's almost like, you guys need to do this.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.400]   You guys need to go through sanctification.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.800]   You guys need to work out your faith.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.120]   You guys need to make sure you're applying what you believe, right?
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   Why?
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.800]   Because I don't want to come to the end and then make all this for naught.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.240]   But I want you to understand what he's saying.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:48.760]   He is really going back to his original statement of his perspective on his entire life.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.480]   What am I saying?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.640]   He's not just simply saying, "You have to do this so that I can glory," versus, "I can
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   weep in vain."
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.480]   What he is saying is, "In either way, I will rejoice."
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.880]   Right?
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:10.840]   Even if I pour out my life just as I'm following the example of my Savior who emptied Himself,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:17.800]   completely, completely emptied Himself, if I'm poured out in the exact same way, even
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.200]   then I will rejoice.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.080]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.840]   And so what I want to share with you is, I want you guys to understand that the theme
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:35.200]   of Apostle Paul saying that he has found this incredible joy is obviously not in circumstance.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.560]   And therefore, if it's not in circumstance, it's also not just because the people are
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.720]   responding well.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   Even besides the fact, even if they don't respond well, if he's poured out and he comes
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.000]   to the point where he faces death, he has found reason to rejoice.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Why?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.280]   Because remember that he started with the incredible, incredible vision that if his
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.240]   life is used to proclaim Christ, then he's going to have joy.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.440]   And what's more, he has commanded us that proclaiming Christ is going to come through
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.080]   our unity, our unity in the Spirit, our unity in Christ, our unity on one purpose to proclaim
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.200]   Christ.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.720]   And what's more, that unity is going to come through the humility that you experience,
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.760]   that you show forth because you're being sanctified in Christ, because you're working out your
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.680]   salvation in Christ.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.520]   And all of that produces incredible joy in you.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.280]   Here's a challenge.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:42.520]   I don't know where you guys are at in your barometer of joy, right?
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.240]   If you're one of those people recently who are just like, "Oh, you know, work is hard.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.760]   Family is tough.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.320]   Everything's really hard and you just got to find joy in the small things of life."
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.120]   And I see nowadays people post up like, "You know, day is done.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.760]   I got the kicked up my feet.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.400]   I've got my nice cold Coke in my hand.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.160]   I'm watching this show, Small Joys in Life."
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.680]   And I'm sitting there like, "Yeah, I'll give you that."
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:13.120]   I get happy when things are going right or you get a nice little break.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.560]   But honestly speaking, if we can't get here, then we're really missing the entire worldview
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.080]   that Christ wants you to have, right?
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.920]   I want to conclude by saying there are many, many commands, many commands.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.960]   He said be united.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   He said be humble.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.900]   He said have the attitude of Christ.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.740]   He said work out your salvation, which I kind of summarize as being obedient as children.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.180]   He says don't grumble, right?
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.140]   Don't be disputing.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:50.800]   But notice how at the end of this, essentially he's saying, "Join me in my joy," right?
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.660]   He is actually giving that kind of intent.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.580]   I want you to rejoice and I want you to share the joy with me.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.300]   What is he saying?
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.820]   He's asking for buy-in.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:07.180]   If you can have this perspective that the proclamation of Christ is the main objective
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.740]   in your life, then whether you are living, great joy.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.660]   And even if you're dying, even greater joy.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:20.500]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.380]   Lord, we want to thank you.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:32.100]   God, we recognize, Lord, that you have given to us by faith a purpose that supersedes any
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.740]   other purpose in this life.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.340]   And therefore, God, you have given to us a cause, a calling, whatever you want to call
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   it that is unshakable by this world.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.500]   And therefore, Lord, we have such a confidence and joy.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:53.780]   God, because you have called us to this, because you have given us this privilege, no one can
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.460]   take it away.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.620]   And Father, just like many of the saints before us, even if we're put in the furnace, even
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:05.540]   if we're put to the dogs, even if we're put out of the city, we have this great joy before
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   us.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:12.700]   And I pray, Father God, that rather than seeking all the small joys of this life, God, we would
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:19.300]   find the joy of knowing you, of serving you, and ultimately, God, being like you.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   Father, I do want to pray that you would challenge us in our faith, that what we see by the spiritual
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.660]   eyes, what we see in your word, it would have its effect.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.860]   And Lord, we trust you.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.740]   We absolutely trust you that what you have started, what you have already shown us, you
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.100]   will bring to completion.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.580]   We thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, and we pray.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   Amen.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   [END]
