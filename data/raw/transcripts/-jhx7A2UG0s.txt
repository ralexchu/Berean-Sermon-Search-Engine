[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   Well, how do I follow God's leading in my daily decisions?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.560]   I know he's my shepherd, he's leading me, I think so.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.080]   But how do I know if I'm following him?
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.440]   That's such an important question
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.920]   we all must answer for ourselves.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.600]   And it was a question taken up
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200]   by a very young Pastor John Piper
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   in his first summer as a pastor.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   In fact, just a few weeks into his pastorate,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.800]   Pastor John preached through some of his favorite psalms.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.480]   One of them being of course Psalm 23.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.260]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.280]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.480]   He restores my soul.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.180]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.280]   I was 22 years old
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.200]   before I first saw one of the lines in this psalm.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   Now I'd seen it, but there is seeing
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.200]   and then there is seeing, right?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.320]   Verse three, he leads me in paths of righteousness
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.960]   for his name's sake.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.200]   I'd never seen for his name's sake
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.160]   till I went to seminary.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.800]   Well, yes, I'd seen it.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.600]   I'd read the words,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   but you can read over phrases in the Bible a hundred times
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.480]   and they never hit you for what they mean.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240]   I went to visit Mrs. Blomgren
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.760]   just before her surgery on Wednesday.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.240]   She was getting her eye operated on.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.680]   It was all bandaged over.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.680]   And I read to her this verse from Psalm 119, verse 18.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.400]   "Deal bountifully with thy servant
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360]   that I may live and observe thy word.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360]   Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.640]   out of thy law."
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.040]   And I said, isn't it true that one of the best things
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.680]   about having two good eyes is the Bible,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.680]   being able to read the Bible.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.520]   But isn't it true too,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.280]   that there is another pair of eyes that God has given us?
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.440]   Paul calls them the eyes of the heart.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.040]   And he prays in Ephesians one,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.520]   that the eyes of the heart might be enlightened.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   And I think that's what the psalmist is talking about.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.280]   "May the eyes be opened that we may behold wondrous things
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.120]   out of thy law."
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.520]   Well, I hadn't seen that phrase there in Psalm 23,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.080]   as wondrous, I'd been as deaf to that theme
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.160]   as you could imagine.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.360]   But there it was,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   "He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake."
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.440]   The thought that God might have been causing me to do right
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.120]   ever since I was a little boy,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.760]   for his sake, just never dawned on me.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.800]   I just, right over that phrase,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.680]   just never even struck me,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.440]   though I'd read it hundreds of times.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.520]   So I want to zero in on that phrase for a few minutes.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.440]   But before we get there,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   we better look at the phrase before it,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.400]   namely, "He leads me in paths of righteousness,"
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.320]   and ask how God does this.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.440]   The picture, of course, here is a shepherd
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.720]   leading a sheep along with his crook,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   or maybe with his call.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.040]   The sheep know my name and they follow me.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.240]   But when we get out of the metaphor of sheep and shepherd
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.280]   into our own experience in our day,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.200]   and ask, "How does God lead in paths of righteousness?"
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.600]   We need to ponder a little bit
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.880]   and poke around in the scriptures to see how he does it.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400]   Now, in my experience,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   I have never seen a manifestation of God going before me
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   at a fork in the road.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.800]   I've never seen a cloud of fire,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.320]   a pillar of cloud like they had in the wilderness.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.480]   That's not part of my experience.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   Nor have I ever heard an audible word
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.520]   that I know was God speaking.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.680]   A lot of people talk in that language,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.840]   and maybe I'm just callous,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.640]   but that's never been part of my experience.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.680]   To see God in some clear manifestation,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   showing me it's this way and not that way,
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.680]   or to hear a voice,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.720]   like my teacher at Wheaton said he heard one day
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.480]   while he was shaving in front of the mirror,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.800]   "Go to Wheaton," from Boston.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   He was in Boston. "Go to Wheaton."
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.880]   God can do that if he wants.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.120]   He's just never done it for me,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.000]   and he doesn't do it for most people most of the time.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.720]   The way he leads us is apparently differently.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.760]   And I think we can get a clue
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.320]   from what David would say in Psalm 119, 105.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.520]   There he says, "Thy word is a lamp to my feet
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   and a light to my path."
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.320]   And in verse 9 of that same Psalm 119,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.440]   "How can a young man keep his way pure?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.520]   By guarding it according to thy word."
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.880]   So one answer to the question,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.280]   "How does God lead his people in paths of righteousness?"
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.560]   is he has revealed a lot about those paths of righteousness.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.760]   He's described what sort of paths are righteous paths
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.880]   and told us to walk in them so that we can read and obey.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.080]   Surely David did that often
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.360]   because he talked about meditating on the word day and night.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.760]   But now that answer is only half the answer, isn't it?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   By itself, the Bible will not keep us on track.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.200]   No matter how wonderful the Bible is
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760]   and how we would be utterly lost without it,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.920]   it is not enough by itself.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.800]   And for two reasons.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.640]   One, we make lots of decisions in life
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.000]   which are not prescribed for us in the Bible.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.520]   Hundreds of little decisions every day, and some big ones,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.000]   in which we look in the Bible and there are no sentences about that.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.160]   How many children to have, where to send your child to school,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.520]   where to go to work, this, that.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.880]   Just hundreds of little things that we have to decide every day.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.680]   And we don't want to bracket those and say,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.160]   "Well, that's not part of Christianity.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.880]   I'll just make those decisions anyway I please,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   and then Christianity is something else."
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.640]   God has to do with all those decisions.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.320]   But the Bible doesn't give explicit guidance
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.040]   for every one of those little decisions,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.120]   and therefore something more has to be said
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.080]   if we're to walk in right paths in those decisions,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.560]   as well as the ones where the Bible is perfectly explicit.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.040]   The second reason that the Bible by itself is not enough
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.080]   to guide us in those paths of righteousness is this.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.480]   A path of righteousness is doing the right thing
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.200]   with a right attitude or a right motivation.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.000]   It's not just a bodily action.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.520]   It's having a right attitude towards your wife as well.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.080]   But reading words on a page don't always change attitudes.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.800]   You can read over what you ought to feel like in the Bible a hundred times,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.760]   and maybe your attitude, you come away from the Bible, it's just the same.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.440]   Something else has to come into play,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.880]   and I think that's why David said, "God leads us in paths of righteousness,"
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:25.440]   and why Paul said, "All who are led by the Spirit are the sons of God."
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.040]   We need not only revelation coming to us from outside, namely the Bible,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   we need transformation coming to us inside from the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.080]   The Word and the Spirit together are the leadership that we need.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.480]   Paul says in Romans 12 to this very familiar word,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.200]   "Don't be conformed to the world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.440]   Why?
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:02.720]   So that you can prove or better approve of the will of God, what is good, acceptable, and perfect.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.400]   In other words, you've got to have something happen up here on the inside,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   some changed attitudes, some changed feelings,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.080]   or when little decisions present alternatives,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   you won't know how to prove which one of those is the will of God.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.560]   So the Bible is the input into that new mind,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.240]   and the Spirit takes the Word and begins to shape our thinking, mold our emotions,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.840]   so that even when there's no explicit command in Scripture for this decision you're facing,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.600]   you weigh all the alternatives, and you're weighing those alternatives with the mind of Christ.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.080]   Paul says, "We have the mind of Christ."
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.240]   And then when you make the decision, you look back,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.760]   and you don't say, "My, what a smart fellow was I,"
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   but rather you say, "Thank you for your Word that informed the principles of my life,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.640]   and thank you for the Spirit that shaped my emotions and my priorities,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   so that I made this decision your way."
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.400]   And God then gets the credit for the leadership.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.560]   Which means, personally for me, that I have been driven basically for all of life
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   to meditate day and night on the Word and to pray continually that the Holy Spirit would work on me.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   You can't over-intellectualize the Bible,
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.480]   you can't over-spiritualize your private experience with God,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.360]   it's both/and, not either/or.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.040]   It has been in my experience, and I haven't found the two in conflict,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.640]   but tremendous complements for guidance in life.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.840]   Finding Guidance for Life, a helpful clip from an excellent early sermon on Psalm 23 titled
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   "The Shepherd, the Host, and the Highway Patrol," preached on September 7, 1980,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.680]   and available in its entirety online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   I found this clip as I'm just working my way through early Piper sermons,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.840]   and if you find a clip from any of your, email it to me, give me your name, hometown,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.280]   the sermon title, and timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.160]   and make a note of what stands out to you in it.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.960]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.000]   AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org, that's an email address,

[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.240]   We're in our 10th year on the podcast, we've covered a lot of topics,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   and that includes the topic of birth control,
