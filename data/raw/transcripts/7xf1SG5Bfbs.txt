[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:42.980]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.980]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.980]   I know I was away for a couple weeks
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.980]   because of our mission trip to India
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.980]   and then my visit out to Korea,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.980]   and I'll explain a little bit about what happened
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.980]   and about our mission work
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.480]   that's gonna start in Korea this summer,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.980]   and I'll give you a little explanation on that.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.480]   But let me get to a few announcements
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.980]   before we get started.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.480]   First of all, our BCC service auction
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   that we have every year is taking place,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.980]   and they're taking submissions for either service
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.480]   or any kind of product that you wanna donate
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.980]   for that.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   They're taking that right now,
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.980]   and then the auction itself is happening in March.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.980]   And again, for the service aspect of it,
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.980]   we're only taking it from members
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.480]   because we're trying to control certain type of things
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   that are going on.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   And the money that's coming in for that
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   is gonna be specifically used for adoption fund.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.980]   So some of you guys may be aware or not aware,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.980]   but for the members of the church
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.980]   and those of you who are interested
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.980]   in possibly adopting children in the future,
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.980]   the funds are gonna be reserved for that.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   And so after you're done with the process,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.980]   there is an application that you can turn in.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.480]   And so the funds that we are raising
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.980]   will be specifically laid aside for that purpose.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.980]   So that's happening.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.480]   Again, the submission for the service
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.980]   and the products are taking place now,
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.980]   and then the service itself, or the auction itself,
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.480]   is taking place in March.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.980]   Men's ministry meeting happening on Saturday,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.980]   February 18th and a few Saturdays.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.980]   The cost of it is $10.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.980]   There's gonna be light breakfast
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   and then a lunch fellowship afterwards.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   And Pastor Mark is gonna be covering
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   the subject of men's purity.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   And so again, this is a subject
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.980]   that I think is very needed in our generation.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.980]   And so we highly encourage you to participate in that
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   and then to establish accountability.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.980]   And again, the subject matter is very important.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.980]   So whether you are a college student or high school student
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.980]   or whether you've been married for a long time,
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.980]   I think it would be very useful.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.980]   Again, so this is happening on a quarterly basis,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   but the next one is happening on February 18th.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.980]   BAM retreat is coming up on Friday,
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.980]   Friday through Sunday on February 24th and 26th.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.980]   The topic is fear of God.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.980]   Pastor Simon Suh is gonna be preaching for the,
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   this is the singles ministry.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.980]   The registration is $150.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.980]   So if you haven't done so,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.980]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   And then one last is SEEDS nursery PTA meeting
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.980]   happening on Sunday, February 26th at 1 p.m.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.980]   So if you have children in any of our departments
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.980]   from the little children, I think up to elementary school.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.980]   So if you have children in that department,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.980]   they're having a PTA meeting to give you announcements
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.980]   on what's happening and to meet some of the teachers there.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.980]   So please come to that.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.980]   Okay.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   One other thing is that I know we've been having parking issues
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.980]   and maybe not, maybe today if had problems parking
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.980]   or finding parking, we are looking for parking.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.980]   And so I just wanted to make an announcement
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.980]   for those of you who attend first service.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   Okay. And maybe today is not usual.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   We made the announcement for service that
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   if you are planning to get off campus,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.980]   to try to get off campus before 11, not at 1110.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   Okay. So if you're gonna get off campus anyway,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   because we need to make some space.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.980]   Last week we ran out of parking.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.980]   I heard the last couple of weeks we ran out of parking.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   So we need your help in doing that.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.980]   So if you are planning to, and then if you attend first service
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   and you're gonna meet somebody for lunch
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.980]   and you brought two cars to take both cars off the campus
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   if possible, so we need to make some space
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   in order to accommodate.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.980]   And so we are looking for more parking,
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   but for now we're asking like if you are able
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.980]   to take the car off campus and then if you're gonna come back,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.980]   I'm sure there'll be enough parking when you come back.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.980]   Okay.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   I think that's it for the announcements.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.980]   Let me pray for our offering.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   Again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   we have an offering box in the back that you can visit afterwards.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   So let me pray for us.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.980]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace.
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.980]   Thank you for the things that we are aware of.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.980]   And especially for the things that we're not aware of.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   That as you are working all things together for good.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.980]   Help us Lord God,
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.980]   to not to simply confess that you are sovereign,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:09.980]   but to believe that all good and perfect gift comes from you.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.980]   We pray that through this service,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.980]   that we would be reminded again of who you are.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.980]   More than anything else Lord God,
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   that we would give you worship in spirit and in truth.

[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.980]   that it may be multiplied and be used for your purpose,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.980]   and your honor, and your glory.

[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:36.300]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   to Luke chapter four, it's been about six, seven weeks
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   since we've been in this text.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   And so we wanna jump back in.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   I'm gonna be mainly covering from 21 to 30,
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   but let me read starting from verse 14
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   to refresh our memory of the context, okay?
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   Luke chapter four, 14 through,
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   I'm gonna read all the way to 30.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   And Jesus returned to Galilee,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   and the power of the Spirit and news about him
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   spread through all the surrounding district.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   And he began teaching in their synagogues
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.300]   and was praised by all.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.300]   And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   and as was his custom, he entered the synagogue
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   on the Sabbath and stood up to read.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   and he opened the book and found the place
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   where it was written, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   and to recovery of sight to the blind,
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   to set free those who are oppressed,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   to proclaim the favor of the ear of the Lord.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   And he closed the book, gave it back to the attendant
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   and sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.300]   were fixed on him.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   And he began to say to them,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.300]   "Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   And all were speaking well of him
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   and wondering at the gracious words
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   which were falling from his lips.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   And they were saying, "Is this not Joseph's son?"
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   And he said to them, "No doubt you will quote this proverb to me,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   'Physician, heal yourself.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   Whatever we heard was done at Capernaum.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   Do here in your hometown as well.'
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   And he said, 'Truly I say to you,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.300]   no prophet is welcome in his hometown.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   But I say to you in truth,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   when the sky was shut up for three years
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   and six months when a great famine came over all the land.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   And Elijah was sent to none of them
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   but only to Zarephath
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   in the land of Sidon to a woman who was a widow.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   And there were many lepers in Israel
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   in the time of Elisha the prophet,
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.300]   and none of them was cleansed
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   but only Naaman the Syrian.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   And all the people in the synagogue
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   were filled with rage as they heard these things.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   And they got up and drove him out of the city
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   and led him to the brow of the hill
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   on which their city had been built
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.300]   in order to throw him down the cliff.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   But passing through their midst,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   he went his way."
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.300]   Let's pray.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:56.300]   Gracious Father, we ask for understanding.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   We ask for eager ears and hearts
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   to listen, to be molded.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   We pray that your word and only your word would go forth.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   Renew us, revive us.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   Help us, Lord God, to see a clearer picture
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.300]   As you guys know,
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.300]   I wanted to give a brief update on India.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.300]   You know, as you guys know,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   the persecution meter in India
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   has been going up exponentially.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   And we've been hearing news from our pastors
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.300]   and just from the news itself,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   the persecution and just how intense it got,
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.300]   especially during the pandemic.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   Because there's basically no police presence
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   in the area that we're going.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   And so the pastors, it's become a regular thing
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   that they're getting rocks thrown at and beaten.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   And so in the midst of that,
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   we've been very encouraged
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   that they had resolve
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   and their fellowship was going strong.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   And they were even adding more pastors to their fold
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   so that they can reach certain areas.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   So some of you guys who don't know,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   the area that we're going into
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   is the heaviest concentration
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   of unreached people groups in the world,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   which I did not know.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   When we first started ministry,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.300]   part of the reason why we decided to go in,
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.300]   it was for that reason.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   Because prior to that,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   I thought the greatest concentration
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   of unreached people groups,
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.300]   I thought that that was in the Middle East.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   And then when I found out that that was in India,
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   and in particular, the area that we're going into,
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   and those of you who've been to India with us
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.300]   know exactly why,
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   because it is just so remote.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   And you have to, even if you're Indian,
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   if you don't speak that local dialect,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.300]   you can't go in there and evangelize.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   So you have to be a Christian
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.300]   who knows that dialect to be able to get in there,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   to be able to share the gospel with them.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.300]   This time around, the environment was very different
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   than any other time that I've been to India.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   Those of you who've been with us to India
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   know exactly what I'm talking about,
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   because when we get there,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   usually it's a pretty lively environment.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   The pastors are there.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   They enjoy each other's company.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   And even in the midst of heavy suffering,
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.300]   as you guys know,
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.300]   we reported about three years ago
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   about eight to ten pastors
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.300]   who were dragged into the forest and beaten
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.300]   and left for dead.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   By the grace of God,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   the forest ranger found them
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   and brought them back to the hospital.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   And then again, not too long ago,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   they broke into the training center
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.300]   that we built for them.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   And one of the pastors was severely beaten
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   and was hospitalized for about a week and a half.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   And even in the midst of that,
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   they're still going strong,
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.300]   still deliberately bringing the gospel to these areas.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   But this time around,
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   we could tell that there was discouragement
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   among the pastors.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   Their greatest concern in this trip
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   was for our own safety.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.300]   In fact, out of the four villages that we went to,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   two of them,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   they had to change the last minute.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.300]   And I didn't even know about that
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   until we were about the fourth day,
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.300]   and they told us that the first village
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   and the third village,
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.300]   they actually had to change the last minute
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.300]   because they found out,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   as they sent pastors the night before
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   to scope out what's going on,
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.300]   they said that there was a crowd
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   that was already stirred up through the leaders
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.300]   waiting for us.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.300]   And so they took us further away
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   than what we normally go to.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   And so again,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   they didn't even share any of this with us
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   in order to kind of keep us comfortable.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   And so I could tell that the environment was,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   there was a little bit of discouragement there.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   And the discouragement was coming
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   not from the outside,
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   but there was a pastor
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   who was a core pastor among them.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   And because he was disgruntled,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.300]   he ended up leaving the group.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   And whether he was doing it
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.300]   or the information is coming through him,
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   it was kind of,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   it was bringing discouragement
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   because they didn't know
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   who was disseminating this information
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.300]   about where we're at.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   They kind of,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   they told me on Thursday
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   that they didn't tell the pastors
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   where we were at.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   And so only the translators
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   and a few of the people
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   that they were familiar with.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   Usually when we get there,
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   there would be about 40 some pastors waiting for us,
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.300]   but this time around,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   it was about the third of the numbers
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   that was there.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   And you could tell
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.300]   that there was some discouragement.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   And so,
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.300]   and they did share with me
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   that there was some concern
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   and that after we leave,
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.300]   that they're going to have to deal with that
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.300]   and we're praying for them
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   so that it would go well,
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.300]   that the discouragement that came in.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   And through all the hardships
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   and the beating that they've gone through,
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   the thing that has brought
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   the greatest discouragement was within.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   And it's probably no different than here.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   When persecution comes
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   and when things become difficult outside,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   typically that strengthens the church.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   It causes the Christians
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   to have a greater resolve.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.300]   But oftentimes,
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.300]   that's not how Satan attacks.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.300]   Satan attacks by, you know,
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   poking at the members within,
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   sometimes within the leadership,
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.300]   bringing division.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   And when that is not handled well,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   it leads to whatever else it leads to in the church.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   And so we're praying for them.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   We're praying that God would continue to use them.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.300]   And again,
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.300]   we're asking you to keep them in your prayers
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   that the ministry--
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   and again,
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   it's one of the most effective things
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   that we've done in our church history
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   because our medical professionals
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300]   and other people who go with us,
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   we're literally going into villages
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   to open the doors for the gospel
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   to go into these Hindus.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   And the typical response that we get from afterwards
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   is that they're surprised
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   that the Christians would be so generous to the Hindus.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   And they would say,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   "The Hindus would never do this for Christians."
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   So they're actually surprised
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   that when it's opened up
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   and at the end of the day,
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   more and more villages come out
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   because they realize that this is open to everybody.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   And that's what opens the door
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   for the pastors to be able to come in
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   and share the gospel.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   Oftentimes, they're actually being invited to come.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   "We want you to come to where we are also."
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   And that opens the door.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   And the reason why we're able to get into these villages
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.300]   is because the Hindu leaders in the villages
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   hear about us,
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.300]   and they're actually inviting us to come.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   So we're coming usually under their protection,
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   under their invitation.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   That's why we're able to get in there.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.300]   But again, some of these villages,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.300]   they found out that leaders were stirred up before we came,
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   and so they had to switch up.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   As you guys know,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   after that, I went to Korea to set up.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   And I just wanted to give a quick announcement
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   that some of you guys who may have heard,
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   starting from this summer,
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.300]   late June to mid-July,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.300]   we're going to be taking our first team out to Korea
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   to possibly start work there.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.300]   We're going to be having our interest meeting
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.300]   next Sunday at 1 o'clock.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   So if those of you are interested,
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   I'll tell you where it's going to be after the second service,
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   and then I'll give you all the information that you need
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   to make a decision if you're willing to come out with us this summer.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   The contrast between these two places
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   couldn't be any further.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   In India, we're talking about,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   we're going in there thinking that
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   we don't know what's going to happen.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   Is it going to be safe for us?
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   And everything about that place reminds us
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   that this is not our home,
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.300]   and it forces us to be sober.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   And it causes us to have deeper fellowship.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   Because we know we're not home,
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   and there is a sense of pressure that we feel.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.300]   Even though we didn't necessarily feel any physical danger,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   that threat is always kind of in the back of our mind,
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   and that causes us to be sober.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   In contrast, in Korea, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   You typically go to Korea, you don't think of hardship.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   Korea is rated number one in technology.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   And as soon as you enter,
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   you know that this is a pretty wealthy country,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   and everything is so convenient.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   Everything that you would think of convenience,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   of why you would want to visit a big city,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   I mean, Korea has that, and then some.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   Spiritually speaking, though,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   Korea is a much more dangerous place than India.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   Because India, everything about it causes us to cling to Christ.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.300]   Everything about India causes us to desire fellowship,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   and it reminds us that this is not our home.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   Korea, on the other hand, is a constant spiritual battle.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   This is a country that had experienced
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   one of the greatest revivals in modern history.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   The last hundred years were a country
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.300]   who almost had no Christianity,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.300]   had 33% and above who claimed to be Christians.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.300]   But in one generation, it went from that to less than 3%.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   So the next generation, where the country was known
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   for fast rise economically, fast rise spiritually,
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.300]   went from that to one of the highest technologically advanced,
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   it is one of the top economies in Asia,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   K-pop, K-drama, that's what it's known for.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   It's known for plastic surgery, it's known for wealth,
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   and yet their spirituality, Christianity, is just bottoming out.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.300]   And so one of our main reasons why we're starting work there
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   is so that we can reach out to the campuses
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   because the churches have basically dried up over there.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   The mega churches, they have, I know a friend
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   who was in charge of the mission program
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   as one of these mega churches, and he told me his budget
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   just for the mission program was $10 million.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.300]   This one particular church put aside over $100 million
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   just in case North Korea opens up,
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:36.300]   so that they can use that to bring the gospel to North Korea.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   But the problem with that is,
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.300]   as much as they are doing all of these things on the surface,
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   spiritually, within their own churches,
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   they have dried up spiritually.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   They have the resources, they have the money,
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.300]   they have the buildings, and yet the people within the church
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   have synchronized into the wealthy, secular, the new Korea
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   that the second generation sees the superficialness of this,
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   and they don't want any part of it.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   And they don't have a second generation to take over
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.300]   what God has built in the previous generation.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   So what we're hoping to do is to get into Korea
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   and help these two particular churches
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   that we've come into contact with
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   to reach out to the local campuses.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   And so, going to India, you need to be sober
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.300]   because you need to know where you're getting into.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.300]   We don't want anybody getting into India
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   thinking like, you know, this is going to be a fun trip.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   Korea, on the other hand, you must be very sober.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   Yeah, because a spiritual attack comes,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   and you don't even know it.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.300]   You get dragged into everything that Korea has to offer,
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   and you might be under attack and not even know it,
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.300]   and so it's much more dangerous to be a Christian in that culture,
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   which is the culture that you and I are in here today.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.300]   Because we're comfortable, because we're wealthy,
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.300]   because we have all the freedom that we need,
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.300]   we have all the access that we need,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   that we're not aware of the spiritual attack that's happening,
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.300]   and we are being dragged into the world,
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.300]   and we don't even know it.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   And so if there's any place where there is in dire need of soberness
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   is you and I here.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   It wasn't the team out in China--I mean, out in India.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   I don't need to remind them to be sober.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   I don't need to remind our team why we're here
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   because everything about it reminds us of that.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.300]   But here, if it's not reminded,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.300]   our natural inclination is because we don't have much threat
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   coming from the outside,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   that we forget that there is an enemy roaring,
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.300]   prowling around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour,
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   and we are being devoured, and yet we are not aware.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   The whole time I was in India,
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.300]   I couldn't get the thought out of my mind
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   that we traveled 35 hours on plane, on buses,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   to get to the village, and just how tiring it is.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   In my 40s, I was okay.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.300]   Now that I'm in my 50s,
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   the travel is getting more and more difficult,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   and then coming back, I barely woke up today.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   [laughs]
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   I was sleeping at--I was--
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   first time in three days,
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   I actually fell asleep in the middle of the night,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.300]   and then Faith came into the room and woke me up.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300]   I said, "Daddy, it's 8 o'clock."
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   And they said, "Yeah, so why are you waking me up? I'm so tired."
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   And I said, "It's Sunday." He's like, "Oh, shoot.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   I'm going to be on the pulpit in about an hour."
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   So I got dressed, and I--
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   [laughter]
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   So I got here.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   The traveling is becoming more tiring,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   but at the same time, you know, it's so rewarding
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   to be able to participate in that work.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.300]   The fellowship that we have with our brothers and sisters
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.300]   while we're there, you know,
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   but I couldn't get that out of my head.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   The whole time I was there--
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   and I did share this with our India team--
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.300]   this is tiring for us to travel 35 hours.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   And if you look at the map,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.300]   this is probably as far as we can go land-wise, distance-wise,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   from where we are in Southern California to where we go, right?
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   And I couldn't get that out of my head,
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   just how far our Lord traveled to come and get us.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.300]   Of course, I'm not just talking about physically.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   I'm talking about the God of the universe
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   who created all things, Holy, Holy, Holy God,
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   took on human form and walked among us
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   and humbled himself, the distance that our God and Savior
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   had to travel to come and bring the gospel, the good news, to us.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   Even if he came as the emperor of Rome,
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   it would have been humiliating for him
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   to live veiling his glory.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   Can you imagine how tempted he must have been
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.300]   while he was walking on this earth
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.300]   when people are mocking him, rejecting him, questioning him?
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   How tempted he must have been,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   the kind of self-control he must have had
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.300]   for him to say, "Enough," and reveal his glory
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.300]   and then just get back to where he was,
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   enjoy his fellowship with the God the Father and the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.300]   just the distance that he traveled.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   You know, the story that we're looking at this morning
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   is about the rejection of Christ at his hometown in Nazareth.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.300]   When we read the gospel superficially,
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   you can read and say, "You know, Jesus starts out,
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   "and maybe he lived humbly,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.300]   "but as he begins to reveal himself,
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.300]   "he starts gaining a bigger and bigger crowd,
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   "and he goes to the cross, and he goes to heaven in glory,
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   "and then one day he was going to come back in his full glory."
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300]   But if you study the gospels carefully,
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   that's not how it's presented to us.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   Every part of the gospel story tells us
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   of why and how he was rejected, not simply by his hometown.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   He goes and spends more than half of his ministry
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:01.300]   in Capernaum, in Chorazin, in Bethsaida,
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   and at the end of his public ministry,
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   they all leave him in John 6, 66,
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   because he says, "I am. I am the bread.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   "You are looking through me to get to something,
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   "but I am the bread."
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   So the whole gospel of John is the seven "I am" statements.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.300]   "I am the light. You're looking for the light,
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   "but I am the light.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   "You're looking for a shepherd, a leader,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   "but I am the good shepherd.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   "You're looking for meaning.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   "I am the way. I am the truth. I am the life.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   "No one goes to the Father but through me."
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   So the seven "I am" statement is trying to correct people
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   who are looking to Jesus, thinking that he is going to get them
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   to where they want to go.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   And Jesus reminds them, "It is me.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   "I am your life. I am your answer.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   "I am your refuge."
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   At the end of that, they reject him.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   And then he heads toward the cross,
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   and at the end of this path,
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.300]   all his disciples that he discipled and he relied on,
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.300]   who walked with him, revealed himself to them.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   They reject him.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   Then at the very end, the leaders of Israel capture him,
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.300]   and then they reject him.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.300]   And then the Gentile world, represented by the Romans,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   they capture him, they crucify him, and they reject him.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   So all of the Gospels basically is summarized in John 1, 9-11.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.300]   It says, "There was the true light of which coming into the world
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   "enlightens every man.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.300]   "He was in the world, and the world was made through him,
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   "and the world did not know him.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.300]   "He came to his own, and those who were his own
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   "did not receive him."
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.300]   The Gospel story is about the rejection of Christ.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   Yes, it ends in glory at the cross,
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.300]   but his whole ministry, his whole life,
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   is about the rejection of Christ, every part of it.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   In fact, Luke 2, 34-35, Simeon prophesied
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.300]   that this was going to happen.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   "Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   "'Behold, the child appointed for the fall
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   "'and the rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.300]   "'And a sword will pierce even your own soul
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   "'to the end that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.'"
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.300]   So from his very birth, he didn't just say he's going to come
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.300]   and seek and save the lost.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   He said many will oppose him.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.300]   Their true intentions and heart is going to be exposed.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.300]   The presence of God, we typically think
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.300]   is going to bring delight.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   But the Gospel story tells us that instead of bringing delight,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   it exposed their sins.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.300]   So this morning, as we look at the text that we're looking at,
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   why did they reject him?
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.300]   They've been waiting for him, praying for him.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.300]   They've been telling each other about him,
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   that when he comes, all things are going to be great.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.300]   Every frustration that they had, every oppression that they felt.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   When the Messiah comes, they studied the Scriptures.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.300]   They reminded each other. They memorized.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   But when he finally came, they wanted to throw him off a cliff and kill him.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:27.300]   Now we may look at that and say, "These dummies."
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.300]   If we were there, I don't know if I would be this blind,
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   if I would be this foolish.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.300]   But these stories are not simply history
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   about something that happened to those people.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   It is an indictment against mankind.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   It is an indictment against you and I.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   How Jesus could be so close.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.300]   How he could have made it so clear.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   How you can go to church all your life
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   and yet have nothing to do with him.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   That is the danger of where you and I are at.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:07.300]   Where you and I have been Christianized.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:14.300]   You and I have been Christianized to the point that we can be so blind.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.300]   You know, the greatest problem in our modern generation
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.300]   is that our churches are filled with people
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:28.300]   who neither hate Jesus nor love Jesus.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   And I think most of you who have been at church, any church, even this church,
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300]   know that that's probably true.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   But our greatest struggle in any period of our church history
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.300]   is that we are constantly struggling.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.300]   Our congregation is filled with people
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   who neither hate Jesus nor really love Jesus.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   And we are perfectly satisfied to be somewhere in between.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.300]   And that's why we say, "Well, we checked off. I did this, this, and this."
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   We say, "What more do you want?"
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.300]   When we know clearly, the Scripture says,
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   "Not anyone who calls me Lord, Lord, child, into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   The greatest thing that God desires of us
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   We know that. We memorize that. We sing that.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.300]   Yet our churches are filled with people
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.300]   who neither hate Jesus nor really love Jesus.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   Why did they reject Him?
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.300]   There's three things that I observed.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.300]   One, they rejected Jesus because they couldn't accept Him as more than a mere man.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.300]   If you remember, as Jesus was going around, remember what they said?
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.300]   They said, "Many people were speaking very highly of Him."
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   By the time He shows up in Nazareth,
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.300]   Jesus was already doing ministry and miracles in Capernaum.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   And so, you remember what Nazareth is.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   Nazareth is a tiny little city, and they said, "What good comes from Nazareth?"
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.300]   All of a sudden, they have a hometown hero.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   They're putting Nazareth on the map.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.300]   The only reason why we even know about Nazareth is because of Jesus.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.300]   So here's this man, from nowhere, all of a sudden, everybody's talking about this man
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   who's performing miracles. Possibly He's the Messiah.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   And they were speaking very highly of Him.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.300]   He comes to his hometown, and it says, "In the synagogue where He grew up."
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   And you have to understand what the synagogue is.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.300]   The synagogue was kind of like their rec center.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   Those of you who've been to India, every village we go to,
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.300]   there is a building that is used universally.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   So typically, a lot of these children don't end up going to regular public school
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   because they're poor, and they end up just kind of creating a makeshift school.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:54.300]   So every building we go into, they have, you know, Telugu, the local language,
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   and then maybe English and math on the board, because that's where they get their education.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   That's where they have town meetings.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   That's where they have cultural centers.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   That's where they invite guests to come.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.300]   Any meeting that requires a little bit bigger building, that's the building that they would use.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:14.300]   The synagogues was that for the Jews, because they kind of spread out,
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.300]   and what typically happened in the temple couldn't happen at the temple anymore,
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   because it was too far.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   If you were a faithful Jew, you would make a pilgrimage maybe once a year, twice a year,
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.300]   if you're very faithful.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   The majority of the Jews probably made it one time,
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.300]   because it cost a lot of money to be able to go to the temple and come back.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.300]   So most of everything that they did happened at the synagogue.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.300]   The synagogue was kind of like the community center
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   where the children were gathered together, getting their education,
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   where the parents, you know, if they celebrated big parties and birthdays,
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.300]   possibly if they had weddings, that's the building they probably used.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:53.300]   The reason why this is significant is because Jesus grew up here.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.300]   Jesus grew up here.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   And so they were very familiar with Jesus.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   Jesus, in every other city, was a prophet, he was a miracle worker,
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   but Jesus, that was his hometown, they saw him grow up.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.300]   Some of them probably have the tables that he made,
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:17.300]   with his dad sitting in their living room, sitting in their houses,
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.300]   the bed that they were sleeping in, Jesus probably made that.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.300]   You know, I've heard so many pastors give sermons about how Jesus was the perfect carpenter,
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.300]   he never had a crooked table, he never had...
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.300]   I think Jesus' table was crooked.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   I think his chairs were not even, because it's not sin, it's human, right?
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.300]   He didn't have a laser pointer, how did he make it so straight?
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.300]   He was probably like anybody else.
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.300]   And that's why it was so difficult for them, because they were willing to accept him
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.300]   as a great man, a performer, a hometown hero,
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.300]   but the problem was, Jesus declared to be much more than that.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:00.300]   In John 6, 42, it says, "They were saying, 'Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   whose father and mother we know?' How does he now say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.300]   See, up to this point, they said they were so enamored with his gracious words,
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.300]   and everybody outside was speaking so highly of him.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.300]   And when he began to say, "I am from heaven," in fact, John 10, 33, goes even further,
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.300]   and it says, "The Jews answered him, 'For good work we do not stone you,
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:31.300]   but for blasphemy, and because you being a man, make yourself out to be God.'"
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.300]   They wanted to reject him. They loved him as a man.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.300]   They loved him as a miracle worker.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   And as long as he didn't speak, they would have adored him.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.300]   They would have lived, he would have lived a very comfortable life
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:51.300]   with everybody admiring him and loving him.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.300]   It was because of the things that he said.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   A mere man, according to their words, claimed to be God.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   And they knew exactly what that meant.
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:10.300]   See, to honor him as a person, as a great example, as a humanitarian,
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   there's nobody greater than Jesus.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   He influenced more people in the last 2,000 years to be gracious and generous,
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.300]   to think of the poor, for doctors to go into remotest villages
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   because of Jesus' example and his teaching.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   But him claiming to be God, he wasn't simply asking us to see his example.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   He wasn't simply asking us to follow him to the poor.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:44.300]   If he is God, he is demanding submission.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   It is no longer about you and I.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:53.300]   If he is God, if he's a great humanitarian, we just follow his example.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   We honor him. Nobody hates Mother Teresa, Albert Schweitzer.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   Nobody hates these people who are generous and give to the poor.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.300]   But Jesus didn't simply say that. He says, "I am God,"
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   meaning that we are to submit to him. We are to obey him.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.300]   We are to worship him.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   If he is God, it is no longer about me and you.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   It is no longer about our wish lists.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.300]   It no longer matters that you live a long life.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   That's not what he promised us. It no longer matters that you have the best job.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:35.300]   It no longer matters that your children are safe.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:43.300]   If he is God, because our greatest calling in life
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   is to submit to this God, is to obey this God, to worship this God.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:55.300]   If he is God, if you keep him as an example,
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   if you keep him as a supporter, a refuge, only without recognizing him as God,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   you would love him. No one would persecute you.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.300]   If all we did to go to the villages and did humanitarian work,
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.300]   every time we go, every village would roll out the red carpet. Why not?
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   These rich Americans are coming in here and doing all these great humanitarian work.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:27.300]   Persecution comes because of the message that is brought with that.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.300]   They wanted to accept him as a hometown hero,
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   the Messiah, the deliverer from Rome, but not as God.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:49.300]   You cannot, you cannot know God as a savior if you do not know God as God.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   That's like saying somebody, somebody saying, "Peter, I really want to have an intimate relationship with you,
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   but I'm not going to accept your Asian-ness."
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   You can't do that. I can't just take that off.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   You can't have a relationship with me if you hate my Asian-ness.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.300]   That's who, because this is who I am. I can't take that off.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:28.300]   You cannot pick and choose the things that you like about Jesus and reject his Godhood.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:33.300]   They wanted Christ as a good example. They wanted him as a hometown hero.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:41.300]   They wanted him to be their king, but could not accept him as God.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:48.300]   That's why the whole Gospel of James, or John, is around the seven "I am" statements of Jesus,
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.300]   because people were coming to Jesus hoping that he will answer their prayers.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:56:03.300]   "Give me bread. Give me some direction. Point us to the right leaders. Sustain us. Guide us."
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:11.300]   In the midst of seeing Jesus as an avenue to get what they want, Jesus says, "I am. I am.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   I'm not leading you to the right direction. I am the destination.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   I don't just give you the bread. I am the bread.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:25.300]   I'm not just going to point you to the leadership. I am the good shepherd."
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   So you can come to church all your life and like the church.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.300]   Love your friends.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   You can fall in love with the idea of being in love with the Bible without really loving the Bible.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   Let me say that again, because we're at a church where the Bible is elevated,
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:53.300]   and we put a high premium on knowing the Bible, but you can be in love with the idea of being in love with the Bible
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:57:00.300]   without being in love with Christ, and you have missed the whole point of why the Bible is elevated.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:08.300]   They rejected him because they wanted his humanity, but they didn't want his deity.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:14.300]   Secondly, they rejected Jesus because he was too familiar.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:19.300]   "Isn't this Joseph's son? Didn't he build our furniture?
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:24.300]   We saw him grow up. His sisters are still with us.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:32.300]   He's speaking in front of his aunties and uncles and elders who watched him grow,
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:37.300]   and now he's not just saying that he has great words.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:42.300]   No, he's demanding more than that."
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   In Mark 6:3, it says, "Is not this carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon,
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:55.300]   are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:00.300]   Even his own siblings had a hard time believing.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:06.300]   You know what this tells me was that Jesus, when he was growing up, did not walk on water just for fun.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   He didn't get hungry and then say, "Hey, I can make gold coins out of these fish. Go get it."
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   Because he lived exactly like them.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.300]   That's why they say, "He was with us. We know this guy.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:25.300]   We remember when he was a kid, when he was circumcised. He was with us.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   We saw him grow up. We know his dad. We know his mom. We know his siblings. We know his work."
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   And because Jesus was too familiar with them, he said, "He was one of us and how can he be greater than us?"
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   Sometimes, the greatest things in our lives are the things that are pretty mundane and regular.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:54.300]   We get caught up in seeking the spectacular, that it causes us to grumble about the regular.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:59:02.300]   You know, the perfect example of that is every single one of us in here, physically and spiritually,
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:07.300]   are here because somebody sacrificed tremendously for you.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:13.300]   Physically, none of you came out of your mother's womb and fed yourself.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.300]   Not one person is saying, "You don't know my mom." It's like, "Of course I know your mom."
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   None of you. I don't care what kind of relationship you have with her or your dad.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:30.300]   Somebody sacrificed to feed you and keep you alive.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   Once a year, we're like, "Oh, Mother's Day, here's some flowers."
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:43.300]   If you had a friend who did a portion of what your parents did for you, you're like, "That's my best friend."
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:50.300]   I remember the first time it really hit me was, by that time, we had about three.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   The fourth one came later.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.300]   It was like we had two weeks of just miserable.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   Esa and I got sick. All the kids got sick.
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300]   We didn't have adults around us, so we were just kind of doing what we can.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   I remember just Esa and I both just miserable, just trying to survive.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:11.300]   The kids got sick. I remember waking up in the middle of the night after about three or four days of this,
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.300]   just miserable, and feeding them milk.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.300]   Just like, "My fever's going nuts, and I have a headache. I haven't slept in three days.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:27.300]   But if I don't feed them, they're going to die. Literally, they're going to die."
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:31.300]   So we're feeding them, then go back to sleep, and miserable came back up.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:36.300]   I remember in one of these nights, miserable, just feeding one of these kids,
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:43.300]   thinking, "My mom must have done this for me. Somebody did this for me."
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   You don't really think about it until you're in that situation and realize just how hard it is to raise a kid.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.300]   But it's so mundane because you're just so used to it.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:01:01.300]   And then when they're immature, it's like, "Well, you're supposed to do that. You're my mom."
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:09.300]   It requires every restraint in your body to hold your arm.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   God is merciful, so I need to be merciful.
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:24.300]   But as tremendous love kept us alive, nothing compared to what God has done for us.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   The distance He traveled, just so that you can understand what I'm talking to you about.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.300]   You didn't choose one day to wake up and say, "Oh, I'm done with this. I'm going to love Jesus.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   I'm going to go to church, and the Bible is just going to make sense to me today."
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.300]   That didn't just happen.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   The Son of God had to empty Himself of His glory. For who?
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.300]   For people who aren't going to appreciate Him.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   Not to the degree that He deserves.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   See, people are going to be constantly distracted.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   People are going to grumble and complain because, "I didn't get the job that I wanted."
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:07.300]   Because life isn't exactly the way I wanted. It didn't happen exactly at the timing that I wanted.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:12.300]   While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   How many people in this room entered with some discontent?
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.300]   Not really ready to worship God.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   The very breath that you and I breathe were dependent upon Him.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.300]   The ability to understand what's coming out of these words.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:37.300]   Remember, if you've ever read the Word of God before the Holy Spirit opened your eyes,
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.300]   it's just nonsense. It's utter gibberish.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.300]   Why does it all of a sudden, one day, make sense?
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   You didn't do that. You didn't all of a sudden, your IQ just started skyrocketing, and then it made sense.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.300]   God had mercy on us.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   But everything that becomes ordinary,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   we have a tendency to not appreciate.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   And that happens with relationships.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   We have a honeymoon stage, and then we get comfortable with our wives and our husbands.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.300]   And then we're always thinking about, "Oh, when we first got married."
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.300]   And then that leads to grumbling.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.300]   And that grumbling leads to failed marriages.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.300]   Because everything that becomes mundane,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.300]   most likely, even in bad marriages,
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   that person probably means more to you than anybody else in your life.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.300]   Because you've gone through more with them than anybody else in your life.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.300]   They've been more patient with you than anybody else in your life.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.300]   And yet, because it becomes mundane,
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:46.300]   it becomes regular, because you interact with them so often,
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.300]   they're no longer spectacular.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   That happens in the church.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.300]   We have a honeymoon stage. "Oh, God has sold us." I can't believe He did that.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   And after about 5, 6, 10 years,
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   the people who are the hardest to reach are the people who were raised in the church.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.300]   The PKs and the MKs
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:09.300]   were so familiar, were so blessed with the presence of the gospel in their lives,
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   are sometimes the hardest to reach.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:18.300]   Because the spectacular has become so mundane.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.300]   And as it becomes mundane,
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   that's when the grumbling comes in.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.300]   Because you're no longer appreciative of what you have,
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.300]   and then when the grumbling comes in, that leads to whatever else.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.300]   Destruction, division.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:38.300]   Jesus was just too familiar.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   How can He be so spectacular when I know Him?
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:47.300]   How can He be anything else other than a good person?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.300]   As a result, they rejected Him.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.300]   But third and finally, they rejected Jesus because
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.300]   Jesus called them out of their sins.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:06.300]   Jesus, at the end, coming into Jerusalem and Nazareth,
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.300]   He said, "People are speaking very highly of Him."
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.300]   He said, "Gracious words are flowing out of His mouth."
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.300]   And then at the end of that, He said, "But isn't He the Son of Joseph?"
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.300]   And Jesus, knowing what's in His heart,
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   He goes off and He says, "You're going to say, quote this proverb."
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   The prophet is not honored in his hometown,
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.300]   and He gives these two stories of the time of Elijah and Elisha.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.300]   And how these two greatest prophets of the Old Testament,
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   Elijah is known as the greatest prophet of the Old Testament.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:42.300]   Elisha had more miracles than any other prophets.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   So when you're talking about powerful miracle workers in the Old Testament,
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   it would be Elijah, and then Elisha took it to the next level.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:55.300]   And He says, "These two prophets God sent to Israel as an indictment against Israel."
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:00.300]   That in the midst of this great famine, instead of going to Israel, He went to a Gentile.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:06.300]   Elisha, instead of healing so many lepers in Israel, healed the Syrian,
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:12.300]   who was an enemy of Israel, as an indictment against Israel.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   Now, why does Jesus say that?
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   He's saying that because He's telling them, "You are living in that generation."
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:24.300]   That Jesus was sent, the Messiah was sent to deliver them,
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.300]   but first and foremost, to indict them for their sins.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   Because until they recognize the darkness in their heart,
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   they would not know who Jesus is.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:46.300]   The dean of divinity of Yale, which is an oxymoron,
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   is quoted in saying this, "How is the preaching of repentance,
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:57.300]   and a call to shape up afterward, how is that good news?"
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:06.300]   Joel Osteen, when they asked him, "How come you don't preach against sin and repentance?"
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:11.300]   His answer was, "There's enough pushing people down in life already."
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.300]   He added, "When they come to my church or our meetings, I want them to be lifted up.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.300]   I want them to know that God's good, that they can move forward,
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   that they can break an addiction, that they can become who God created them to be."
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.300]   On the surface, he's like, "Yeah, life is hard enough."
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   I said, "You know how hard it is to raise kids?
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:38.300]   You know how hard it is to have a good marriage?
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   You know, like the economic downturn, there's a recession coming,
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   or at least everybody's saying.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.300]   So life is hard enough as it is, and you go to church and say,
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.300]   'We need to repent of our sins. We don't want people leaving our church discouraged.'"
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.300]   I said, "There's enough discouragement."
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.300]   On the surface, that sounds great.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   "Yeah, God is gracious. He's love. He loves us unconditionally.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:06.300]   Why do we keep hearing a call to repentance?"
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   Robert Shuler, when they asked him this question,
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.300]   he said, "The core of sin is lack of self-esteem.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   Sin is psychological self-abuse.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.300]   The most serious sin is one that causes me to say, 'I am unworthy.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   I may have no claim to divine sonship.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:30.300]   If you examine me at my worst, for once a person believes he is an unworthy sinner,
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:39.300]   it is doubtful if he can really honestly accept the saving grace God offers in Jesus Christ."
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.300]   If you've never read the Bible, read it superficially,
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.300]   you may read that and say, "Yeah, that sounds about right.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.300]   Because God is gracious and loving.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.300]   You want the church to be a place where people are living uplifted
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:57.300]   and want to face the hardship of life and marriage and raising children.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   Why do you want to feel down when you leave the church?"
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:08.300]   But if you read the Bible, you know this is utter blasphemy.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   Jesus gives an example of the Pharisee who comes up and says,
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.300]   "Thank God I'm not like them. Thank God you've blessed me that I don't act like these sinners."
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:20.300]   And he had the tax collector beating his chest because he couldn't raise his head.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   And Jesus said, "Who is forgiven?
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.300]   Who has found peace?
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.300]   Who has found salvation?
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.300]   Who is forgiven?
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.300]   The tax collector."
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.300]   There's a reason why this whole drama of the Israelites,
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   everything was given so that sin could be utterly sinful.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   And it says at the perfect time when sin became utterly sinful,
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.300]   Jesus came to expose the sins of Israel,
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   his hometown, the nation of Israel, his own disciples, and the world itself.
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:02.300]   Why did he need to expose their sins?
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.300]   Because their greatest problem was not economics.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   Their greatest problem was not oppression from Rome.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:15.300]   Their greatest struggle is not the relationship between mom and dad.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:22.300]   Their greatest heartache didn't become because relationships are difficult.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:30.300]   He said all of that exists because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:39.300]   All the problems of mankind, all the heartaches, all the broken families,
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   all the drug addictions, all the sexual addictions,
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:55.300]   sex trafficking, poverty, brokenness in this world, at the core is sin.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   So until our sins are exposed and we recognize how desperate we are without Christ,
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.300]   Christ is a good man.
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.300]   He's a moral man.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:15.300]   He's a man to be honored, respected, maybe even imitated,
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   but never to be surrendered to.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:24.300]   Until we recognize that he came to save us from our own sins.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   This is why self-righteousness is so harmful to your soul.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   Because self-righteousness focuses all the problems on outside of you.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.300]   On them.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   On this. On that.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:45.300]   And this is why grumbling is so detrimental to your souls.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   Because a grumbling spirit does not recognize the greatness of God.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:12:02.300]   It's like going to a spectacular view and then complaining about the gravel on the ground.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   Why did they make parking like this?
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.300]   Why did they make the roads like this?
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:16.300]   Why did they make the signs like this in the presence of glory?
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:21.300]   They could not accept his indictment against them.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:31.300]   Instead of leading to repentance, they wanted to get rid of what brought judgment.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:36.300]   In John chapter 8, people who already believed him, Jesus said,
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.300]   "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.300]   And they just could not.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.300]   They loved his teaching.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.300]   They wanted to follow him.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.300]   Because Jesus said, "You need to be set free."
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   That was enough to trigger them.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.300]   And they also wanted to do the same.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.300]   You see, the greatest calling for every individual in here, including myself,
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.300]   is to recognize our own sins.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:12.300]   And come before the only person in the universe who has any answer to my own sins.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.300]   I don't just turn off selfishness.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.300]   If you struggle with coveting, you don't just come in here and say,
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:21.300]   "Oh, I'm just going to memorize scripture and coveting and be gone."
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.300]   If you have bitterness in your life because of something happened to you,
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.300]   you don't just come to church and say, "I'm just going to stop thinking about it.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.300]   Stop thinking about it."
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:36.300]   The only person that can deliver you from your own sin is Christ crucified.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:44.300]   The Son of God who traveled the distance that you and I could not possibly imagine
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.300]   to seek and save the lost, which is you and I.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:58.300]   That we may be delivered from the main reason why we suffer.
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:03.300]   That he may give us life and give this life abundantly.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   You're not going to find abundant life because you found good friends.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   You're not going to find abundant life because you committed to a good church.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.300]   You're not going to find abundant life because your family is in order
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:23.300]   or you married the right person or you found a good job or you saved enough money.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:30.300]   This life that he's talking about can only be found when we are delivered from our own sins
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   and restored to the author of life.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.300]   So my prayer as we continue to study the Gospel of Luke,
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:43.300]   that we see, that we don't look at these stories and say,
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.300]   "Oh, these dummies. How can they have missed him?
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.300]   This is an indictment against us."
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.300]   But not to leave us in our guilt, not to leave us in our indictment,
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.300]   but that would lead us to our knees.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.300]   And that we would be reminded of what it is that we have in Christ.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.300]   And that's why we have the communion table today.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:05.300]   The communion table is given to us so that we may do this in remembrance of him.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.300]   That we would recalibrate our lives, that everything that we are doing,
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.300]   everything that we're hoping, if what we are pursuing has nothing to do
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:16.300]   with what this table represents, to recalibrate our lives,
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.300]   to take time before the Lord in prayer,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.300]   that we do not come up here in an unworthy manner.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   You don't come here by your own righteousness.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.300]   You don't come here because you've been good this week.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.300]   You come here because we are in need.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:32.300]   Just like the first day we needed Christ, we need him today,
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.300]   and we will need him tomorrow.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.300]   So be in prayer.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:41.300]   And as we always remind you, that this is a remembrance of our union with Christ.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:46.300]   So if you've never had a union with Christ, where you repented of your sins,
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:51.300]   and you have never been baptized, we ask that you do that first.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.300]   If you've never repented, and you've never come to Christ,
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   we ask that you would come today.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.300]   Just be honest before the Lord.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.300]   Lord, open my eyes. Let me see you.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.300]   I want to know who you are.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.300]   I've been admiring you from a distance, but I don't know you.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.300]   I appreciated you, but I don't love you.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.300]   I don't hate you, but I don't love you.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   So take time before the Lord in prayer, honest prayer.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:20.300]   I believe. Help my unbelief.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300]   I am in need.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.300]   So when you are ready, we're going to ask you one by one to come up.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:28.300]   And we're going to ask the pastors and the elders to come
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.300]   and help me open up the communion table.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:36.300]   So if I can ask the leaders to come.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   And I'm going to open up the communion table.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:42.300]   If I can ask, like in the midsection we have two, and we have one on the other side.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.300]   So that section come there.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.300]   This section come to this side, and that section come to this side,
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.300]   and that section come to that side.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   Then after I open up the communion table, as you are ready to come up and participate,
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:59.300]   you grab your own cup, and we'll give you the bread.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   And as you are seeing the line, if let's say the line on this side is long and this is short,
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.300]   you're more than welcome to go to the shorter line.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.300]   But just in general, because this is the shortest distance for you to come,
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.300]   and then when you're ready, just come and participate.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:20.300]   In 1 Corinthians 11 it says, "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.300]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.300]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:34.300]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.300]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.300]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.300]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.300]   Amen.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:50.300]   Father, we thank you for giving us this sacred time.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:55.300]   You know, Father God, how prone we are to wander and forget.
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   Help us to approach this holy time with reverence.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:07.300]   Examining our hearts, examining our lives, examining your grace.
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:14.300]   Help us, Lord God, to be revived, restored, recommitted.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:21.300]   That Christ may be exalted, worshipped, and loved.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.300]   So for that end, we pray for your anointing over this time.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.300]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:32.300]   So again, as you are ready, we invite you to come one by one.

[01:30:54.300 --> 01:31:04.300]   Let's pray.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.300]   Matthew 5, 3 and on.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:12.300]   Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:17.300]   Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.300]   Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:27.300]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:32.300]   Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:37.300]   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:43.300]   Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:51.300]   Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:04.300]   Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:11.300]   For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:22.300]   Lord, we pray that each one of us would embody the Beatitudes, Lord God, that you've taught us.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.300]   That these are the characters, Lord, of your children and your kingdom.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:31.300]   Help us not to pursue or to covet the things of this world.
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:38.300]   Help us, Lord God, to be renewed in our mind that we would not conform to the pattern of this world,
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.300]   but to transform, Lord God, as you called us.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:50.300]   I pray that your presence, your Holy Spirit, that you've deposited in your children
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:56.300]   to groan on our behalf, Lord God, to be reunited with you.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:01.300]   That we would be aware of that groaning, that we would pray along with that groaning,
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:07.300]   that we would pursue that groaning with all our hearts more than anything else, Lord God.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:14.300]   Help us not to sacrifice the things that are eternal because we are tempted by the temporal.
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:21.300]   Send us wherever you desire that we may be the aroma of Christ.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:32.300]   May Christ and his sacrifice and his love and his pursuit bear much fruit, Lord God, wherever you send us.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:46.300]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:55.300]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:06.300]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:27.300]   Because he lived, I can face tomorrow.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:37.300]   Because he lived, all fear is gone.
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:48.300]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:58.300]   And life is worth the living just because he lived.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.300]   Amen.
