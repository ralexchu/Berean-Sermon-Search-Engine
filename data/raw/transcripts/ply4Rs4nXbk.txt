[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:21.260]   I'm sweating. Oh my goodness. That night window was so heavy. Did you see Garry just one man that thing?
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.260]   I saw you try to and I'm like oh my god. Look at me compared to him man. I'm tiny. He's got like the back muscle of the least man.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.260]   No one works out those muscles back there. Except Garry. I could not. I could never.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.260]   You guys are a small team. That's what's going to happen.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.260]   My name is Ashley. My wife and my daughter extremely like the king and the elephant.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260]   Nice.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260]   Love it.
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260]   King.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260]   Alright.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260]   My heart is beating. Oh one more time.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260]   Split second.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260]   Hello hello good evening. What's your name?
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.260]   Carolyn.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260]   Carolyn I promise to forget your name in the future.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260]   *laughter*
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260]   That's good. Aww.
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260]   Hey she's awake.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260]   So small.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260]   Such a smallish.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260]   So small.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260]   I know.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.260]   I don't know if she's waving or if she's just like being vibrated by Tim's pads.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260]   Look up Carolyn.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260]   She's waving.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.260]   I know.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260]   She's watching.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260]   She's watching your every move.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.260]   *laughter*
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260]   Oh oh Alex look what you did.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260]   She's got you.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260]   She said feed me.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260]   Makes sense.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260]   Did I?
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260]   Did you feed me?
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.260]   Let's start our praise prayer service tonight.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.260]   *crowd noise*
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260]   We'll begin our service with a song called Worship.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.260]   So let us continue to come forward as we sing this song.

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.100]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.460]   Well, it's a privilege for us to come together
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.460]   for prayer, and as you know, we have these pre-audited,
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.420]   so we can gather our hearts together,
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.820]   lifting up our God, and raising up our voices in prayer.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.500]   Tonight, we will be encouraged by the word,
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.980]   and we'll have extended time to go to God in prayer.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.740]   Interestingly, one of the things that we will do again
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.900]   as we come before is to remove the white chairs
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.700]   for those who wanna come forward,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.300]   and to kneel as you are in prayer,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.700]   and we'll actually do that.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.780]   A periodic is a meal, a mass will have to be a meal,
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.940]   because some people are just so obedient that way.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.220]   And as you know, it's not necessarily something
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.460]   is because we want it, but we want each individual
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.420]   to express what they feel.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.700]   We want each individual to show and mean
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.500]   what they say and say.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.380]   And so in that case, that's why I'm structurally
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.740]   speaking that people will actually stand
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.500]   and raise their hands to the sky,
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.620]   and lift up holy hands when you pray,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.420]   or you'll find that they'll close off their face
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.820]   prostrate before you.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.140]   It's all variety, because it is ways we can react
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.340]   to God in our real life, amen?
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.740]   And so with that said, please do not feel outnumbered.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.660]   We're gonna dim the lights, we don't want you
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.820]   distracted by people or anything else,
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.340]   but that we will really read your letters to us.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.300]   Let's go in prayer as we prepare for this time.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:55.820]   Heavenly Father, we thank you guys so much.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.940]   Lord, you are so great, so powerful.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   There is nothing, not even the greatest of kingdoms,
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.540]   and not even the most private of hearts,
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.700]   the hearts of man, that is outside of the reach.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.940]   And therefore, God, we trust you.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.660]   Lord, therefore, with faith and hope we pray.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.740]   And so we ask that this evening,
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.220]   as we join our hearts to render to you
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.700]   all the various requests,
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.420]   things that are happening in our lives.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.740]   We ask that you would be merciful.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.900]   Also, Lord, as we lift up these songs of praise,
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.460]   God, that is not so much from a period of dissonance,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.500]   but rather knowing that you are disproving.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.820]   Regardless of how we came here today,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.460]   we want to lift to you a simple sacrifice
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.340]   from the time of our inheritance.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.500]   We thank you, God, for your grace and we pray.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.340]   Amen.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:10:01.420]   - Let us all rise as we sing these praise songs.

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:11.940]   Okay, I would like to give a brief encouragement
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.500]   from the scriptures from Romans chapter nine,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.060]   verses one through five.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.900]   From Romans chapter nine, verses one through five.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.780]   And by way of thinking through this,
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.900]   when we think about our Christian faith,
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.380]   there are a lot of people who seek to summarize
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.980]   our Christian faith in one simple statement
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.900]   or one essence or foundation.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.460]   For example, it's all about love, right?
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.820]   It's all about serving people.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.140]   It's all about loving others or something like that, right?
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.820]   But to us, that category, it's difficult
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.300]   when we're trying to summarize all of our Christian faith
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   into one thing, one concept, one character trait,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.460]   that one foundation.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.580]   Because you and I both know, it's much broader than that
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.780]   because Christianity can be more better summarized
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.420]   within one person, the person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.140]   And in a way, if people try to summarize Christ
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.100]   in one facet, one character, one trait,
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.500]   they would be doing him a disservice.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.820]   But instead, for us, we're saying everything
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.380]   that Christ does.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.900]   And we ask the question throughout different circumstances
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.580]   of life, what would Christ do in this situation?
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.780]   It's because our Christian life is summarized
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.220]   by we are followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.500]   And therefore, because we're followers
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.700]   of the Lord Jesus Christ, it's not just simply
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.380]   what he does we're following, it's also his attitude
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.700]   that we're following.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.860]   It's also his perspective.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.380]   It's his judgment.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.100]   It's Christ's discernment.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.060]   It's even how he feels.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.140]   We wanna react to things the way that he would.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.900]   We wanna feel the way that he feels
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.940]   when he judges and sees people, even.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.540]   And so, we think about, tonight,
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.740]   Jesus's heart for the lost.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.340]   And we know that a huge part of following Christ
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.700]   means that every single one of us,
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.020]   we need to break for the lost, amen?
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.180]   We know that our hearts should also long
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.220]   to such a degree that we would take initiative,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   we would make plans, and we will go pursue
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.100]   the lost in our lives.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.460]   We would not only do that, but we would avail ourselves
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.780]   to welcome, to exercise hospitality,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.460]   to have open arms, and even to commune,
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.940]   and sit down and dine and continue to serve
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.780]   those who are lost.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.580]   And with that same vein, Apostle Paul,
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.820]   in Romans chapter nine, verses one through five,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.940]   he expresses his heart, his heart attitude,
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.900]   when he thinks about his fellow Jew,
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.340]   his fellow countrymen, and he says this.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.580]   Romans chapter nine, verses one through five.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   I'm telling the truth in Christ, I'm not lying.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.380]   My conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.180]   that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.500]   For I wish I could, that I myself be a curse,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.580]   separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren,
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.860]   my kinsmen according to the flesh,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.140]   who are Israelites to whom belong the adoption as sons,
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.100]   and the glory and the covenants, and the giving of the law,
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.500]   and the temple service, and the promises.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.620]   Those whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.780]   according to the flesh, who is overall,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.220]   God blessed forever, amen.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:47.260]   Okay, so in jumping down into a passage in Romans nine,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.940]   we know obviously, Apostle Paul, through the Book of Romans,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.760]   has laid down the foundations of the gospel.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   In the beginning chapters of Book of Romans,
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.500]   he essentially laid down that every single person
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.740]   is bound in sin, right?
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.300]   Revealed that each individual, no matter whether Gentile
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.100]   or your teacher of the law,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.660]   you're underneath this condemnation to such a degree
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.000]   that our depravity is slavery, that we are enslaved to sin.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.700]   But thanks be to God, there is absolute freedom,
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.820]   and thanks be to God, there is no condemnation in Christ.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.320]   In chapter eight of the Book of Romans,
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.820]   after having laid out that salvation is by faith,
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.960]   he has, in beautiful fashion,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.400]   described the incredible security that is found
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.320]   in the unfailing love of Christ.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.800]   That when God has set upon his people his promise,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.880]   it is an unbreakable chain.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.220]   That each individual that God ministers to,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.240]   they're going to be elected, they're going to be washed,
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.220]   and they're going to be glorified, okay?
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.820]   In thinking through that in context,
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.960]   there is this question then that is raised,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.560]   and that's what he's answering in chapter nine,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.000]   and that question essentially is,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.520]   but what about the Jewish people,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.800]   in the sense that so many of them,
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.520]   actually the entirety of Jerusalem,
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.640]   that when Christ came, they cried for his crucifixion?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.880]   And in current standpoint, although the Jewish people
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.160]   have received incredible persecution,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   many of them have already rejected Christ.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.820]   So what gives, okay?
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.620]   And what's very interesting is to this question
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.020]   of Apostle Paul reassuring that God's promise is true,
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.180]   and Apostle Paul demonstrating that God is faithful
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.540]   to all of his promise, okay?
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.160]   He begins by expressing his heart.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.800]   He begins by expressing emphatically his emotion,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.100]   and that's what I want to draw our attention to tonight.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.380]   Apostle Paul says again in verse one,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.380]   "I am telling the truth in Christ, I'm not lying.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.940]   "My conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.340]   "that I have this great sorrow."
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.760]   I mean, if you think about a way
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.060]   to emphatically state something,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.620]   he says, "I'm telling the truth in Christ,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.200]   "I'm not lying," which is redundant,
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.100]   "my conscience testifies in the Holy Spirit."
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.040]   This would be a lot like Jesus saying,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.660]   "Verily, verily, I say to you," right?
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.840]   "Listen, listen, please listen."
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.700]   And what he's trying to get us to understand
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.700]   is he has this incredible sorrow and unceasing grief, okay?
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.740]   So as a first point that I want to highlight
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:44.620]   and encourage us with is again, if we're following Christ,
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.460]   we too, paradoxically as Christians,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   will regularly feel great sorrow and unceasing grief.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.640]   We must follow Christ's sorrow with grief in our heart.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.480]   Why?
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.000]   Because paradoxically, yes,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.480]   the Christian life is much about rejoicing.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.300]   In view of the incredible grace and mercies of God,
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.240]   when we look at God and then when we look at us,
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.840]   there should be incredible joy that is inexplicable
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.480]   and beyond any circumstance, amen?
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.660]   And yet paradoxically, we're going to see increasing sorrow,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.820]   increasing grief in our hearts
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.220]   because the light of Christ will open our eyes.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.520]   Will open our eyes to the sufferings of man,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.240]   but more so open our eyes to the deserved consequence
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.120]   of sin in this life.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.240]   Is this a wicked and perverse generation?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.000]   Yes.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.800]   Does that cause us incredible grief?
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.640]   Yes.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.680]   If you take a look at Luke chapter 19,
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.860]   verses 41 through 44,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:55.400]   if you recall, Jesus' heart was incredibly grieved.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.680]   When he looked upon Jerusalem, it says in Luke 19, 41,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.520]   "He saw the city and he wept over it,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.500]   "saying, 'If you had known in this day,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   "'even you, the things which make for peace,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.240]   "'but now they have been hidden from your eyes,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.720]   "'for the days will come upon you
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.360]   "'when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.520]   "'and surround you and hem you on every side,
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.020]   "'and they will level you to the ground
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.820]   "'and your children within you,
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.160]   "'and they will not leave in you one stone upon another,
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.400]   "'because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.'"
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.820]   I want us to take a moment to meditate and think.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.940]   We have heard this kind of story before,
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.920]   that when Christ looks upon a fallen city,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.280]   like a mother hen, he grieves.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.420]   He actually weeps over the city, yes?
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.000]   But then now there's that challenging question for us.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.720]   Is the state of our heart and condition of our soul,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   when we see the generation,
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.920]   when we see the current even state of our country,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   when we see all kinds of paganism, all kinds of fallenness,
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.960]   one of the questions I ask is, what is the state of my heart?
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.340]   You know, what's really interesting is,
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.740]   nowadays when I watch TV,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.660]   if I'm listening to radio on my drive,
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.300]   I will be honest with you,
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.500]   there is an incredible temptation for me
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.180]   to absolutely harden my heart.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.100]   I hear heading, news lines, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.020]   of something horrendous that was done.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.420]   And I heard on the radio, I heard on YouTube,
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.540]   someone say this silly line,
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.740]   you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.480]   And in my head, I just chuckled and laughed,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.740]   and then I realized that was in my heart,
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.160]   just confessing to you.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.400]   Now, the fact of the matter is, is that statement true?
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.680]   100% it's true.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.720]   Scripture literally says, you reap what you sow.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.840]   Scripture literally says,
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.880]   what you put in is what you're gonna get out.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.560]   You have your just dessert, okay?
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.020]   However, I want you to meditate on the fact
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.780]   that Jesus is looking upon Jerusalem,
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.300]   an entire city and mob,
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.340]   which is gonna call for his crucifixion.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.460]   And he weeps over the fact
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.340]   that these people are going to experience
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.020]   the full consequence of their rejection.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.540]   And he mourns.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.020]   Do you not understand you have completely missed,
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.080]   you didn't recognize your visitation.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.320]   And so to us, how silly,
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.780]   if I said it out loud, you play stupid games,
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.900]   of course you're gonna win stupid prizes,
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.380]   as one who was also a slave to this world.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.820]   Right?
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:01.040]   How silly of me to have only that attitude,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.180]   given that my Savior looking upon people
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.240]   who will cry out for his own death is weeping.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.540]   Now again, this is why little platitudes of,
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.500]   oh, you know, Jesus is only this or only that,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.540]   we can't put him in a box
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.460]   because you have this incredible nature
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.300]   in which he knows the exacting nature of God.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.020]   He knows the perfect faithfulness of God to his holiness.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.680]   And yet he grieves knowing where the whole city is headed.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.940]   They're headed for destruction.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.100]   And so I wanna challenge you,
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.660]   do not react to the things that you see in this world
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.820]   with just the same kind of reaction any commentator would.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.740]   And you also need to reflect on the fact
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.100]   that even Apostle Paul, he's just a man.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.860]   And he's now crying, and he's trying to emphatically say,
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.020]   trust me, I'm not lying to you.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.740]   In my heart is sorrow and grief for you.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.220]   But let me ask you the question,
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.800]   of any other group, which group persecuted him the most?
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.140]   Of any other people, which people gave him the hardest time?
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.100]   And at this juncture in the book of Romans,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.700]   who has already been his greatest antagonist?
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.140]   A passage in Philippians answers that question.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.060]   In Philippians chapter three, verse two and six,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.240]   Apostle Paul says, beware of the dogs.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.900]   Wow, that's an incredible statement to say.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.420]   Beware of the evil workers.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.540]   Beware of the false circumcision.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.820]   You know who he's talking about.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.580]   For we are the true circumcision,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.500]   who worship in the spirit of God
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.340]   and glory in Christ Jesus,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.140]   and put no confidence in the flesh,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.780]   although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.660]   If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.420]   I far more circumcise the eighth day,
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.620]   the nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin,
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.700]   Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee,
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.880]   as to zeal, a persecutor of the church,
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.100]   as to the righteousness which is in the law,
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.380]   found blameless.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.420]   Now, I highlight that because Apostle Paul,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.720]   in defense, he's saying,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:11.560]   these people think that I'm preaching the gospel
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.260]   out of what, because I can't do anything else,
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.340]   I can't make money?
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.900]   Because I was a licentious sinner
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.420]   and I couldn't hold the law
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.940]   and I couldn't be a good Jew?
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.020]   And he's defending himself, saying,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.420]   no, it's not because I lacked anything.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   As a matter of fact, you wanna go toe to toe,
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.380]   I could've been the best of any of you, right?
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.300]   But in saying that, what he's gonna say is,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.020]   so I want you to actually know
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.140]   that in my heart I have genuine sorrow.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.000]   You live in a system that, yes, has rules, policies,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.980]   has standards and culture, has history and legacy,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.220]   but it doesn't have Christ.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.660]   And that, in his eyes, brings sorrow,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.260]   it brings grief, it brings pain,
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.300]   brings worry, it brings sleepless nights, right?
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.180]   And in that way we're challenged.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.140]   As followers of Christ,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.460]   Apostle Paul set a model for us to follow Christ.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020]   Even those who would pain us and hurt us,
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.260]   are we grieving for them?
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.980]   Is there anybody in your life
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.700]   by which because they've caused you so much pain,
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.700]   because they've caused you so much inconvenience,
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.100]   so much burden, that you have said,
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.260]   perhaps in the more deeper recesses of your mind,
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.620]   it would be so much better if you weren't here.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.620]   But rather, are we moved with compassion?
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.380]   Are we moved with such zeal?
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.340]   Are we moved with such composure of Christ
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.860]   that we would weep and have sorrow
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.060]   and be willing to carry that burden of love?
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.260]   There are some people
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.660]   we have very little hope whether they would turn.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.580]   It's been too long waiting.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.940]   There are some people who,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.260]   there's just no signs of repentance, forget that.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.860]   I mean, for them to admit one thing wrong, maybe.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:15.740]   If we follow in the attitude of Christ,
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.540]   we are going to be willing to bear the sorrow
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.780]   of caring for their soul, even if it looks so bleak.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.220]   Next, as a point two,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.060]   we recognize the intention of the gospel.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.700]   I'm just gonna say intention of the gospel.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.540]   I didn't know exactly how else
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.980]   to describe what he's saying.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.620]   Take a look, and what he says is,
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.620]   "For I could wish that I myself were accursed,
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.460]   "separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren,
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.660]   "my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.700]   And if you take a moment to think about that,
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.940]   it sounds wrong, doesn't it?
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.340]   If you take a moment to think about it,
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.180]   it sounds so wrong.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.980]   How could you, as a man,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.340]   again, Apostle Paul's not an angel.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.840]   He's for sure not Jesus himself.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.540]   He's a man.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.660]   And he says, "I wish I could be accursed for you."
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.580]   That sounds almost wrong.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.180]   How can he say that?
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.720]   Well, first, again, going to the idea and theme
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.460]   that we must follow Christ in his example,
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.840]   Christ in his attitude, Christ in his intent,
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.260]   we remember his own words that in Mark 10:45,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.000]   Jesus said, excuse me,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.480]   "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.440]   "and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.380]   Likewise, then, in following Christ's example
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.940]   and his following Christ's intent,
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.220]   Apostle Paul defends himself.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.720]   Another example is from 2 Corinthians 12:19,
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.460]   where Apostle Paul says in defense,
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.520]   because they were accusing him,
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.180]   like, oh, you're not an apostle.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.600]   Oh, you don't have the authority.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.740]   Who gave you that right?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.360]   Apostle Paul says, "All this time, you have been thinking
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.960]   "that we are defending ourselves to you.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.140]   "Actually, it is inside of God
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.260]   "that we have been speaking in Christ
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.760]   "and all for your upbuilding, beloved.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.460]   "For I am afraid that perhaps when I come,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.480]   "I may find you to be not what I wish,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.560]   "and may be found by you to be not what you wish,
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.680]   "that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy,
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.060]   "angry tempers, disputes, slanders,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.420]   "gossips, arrogance, and disturbances."
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.580]   Now, the reason why I bring this up
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.360]   is because earlier I mentioned,
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.960]   what is he saying by saying, I wish I was accursed for you?
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.900]   Is he saying, kind of like when two bros
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.980]   who have been friends for a long time says,
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.360]   hey, you and me, ride or die, I'll take a bullet for you.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.140]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.380]   Loyalty, right?
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.680]   Sense of friendship.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.120]   And I'm gonna tell you, no.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.720]   Apostle Paul, very specifically,
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.420]   in his mind and his eyes,
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.980]   are focused on the perspective
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.880]   that these individuals could have wealth,
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.140]   health, and longevity,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.200]   but without Christ, they would be dead.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:26.320]   What they need to avoid is to avoid the consequence of God
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.160]   and being accursed from Christ,
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   and what they need to gain is very specifically
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.620]   the only salvation that is found in Christ, amen?
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.280]   And so, I ask you, in your eyes,
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.640]   in following Christ and the example of Apostle Paul,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.440]   when you see the people in your workplace,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.720]   in your school, and in your family,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   who have a good education, a good marriage, a good family,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.460]   and they seem to do well,
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.600]   do you feel like, ah, they're good,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.160]   eventually they'll come around?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.260]   Do you feel like they're okay?
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.000]   Part of the reason, you guys know that,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.920]   I myself personally have been very against
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.840]   things like social justice, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.280]   and part of the reason why is because
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.040]   there's a grave difference in perspective.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.400]   What grieves my soul is not simply poverty, right?
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.600]   And it shouldn't be yours.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.880]   What grieves your heart and makes you cry
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.080]   shouldn't just be suffering.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.580]   Now, is that important?
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:31.160]   Yes, but to every single one of us,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.480]   we're not just saying, hey, I'll die for you
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.120]   for any cause, any reason, I won't die for you
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.080]   just so that you would have a better life,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.360]   I won't die for you just so that
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.160]   you would have more money or health.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.840]   For us, the only reason why we would self-sacrifice
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.240]   is because what's good for a person
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.460]   is the salvation of their souls.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.120]   And so I wanted to give you that perspective
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.280]   because I really feel like we live in a generation
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.620]   where people literally are going to tell us,
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.120]   oh, all you have is religious talk?
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.860]   Even for those who are poor down in the streets,
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.920]   you're gonna come and just preach the gospel?
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.400]   You're gonna come and just invite them to church?
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.840]   People in their current perspective are gonna think,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.720]   you know what's the solution is, just simply economy.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.360]   You know what's the solution is,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.160]   is a community, is a sense of relationship.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.960]   No.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.800]   Every single soul without Christ
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.040]   is gonna receive eternal damnation from God Almighty.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.700]   And if that's the case, then I have no qualms
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.460]   about disrupting someone's life to say,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.620]   hey, I'm not just trying to sell you a cheap car,
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.820]   I'm not trying to sell you on better finances
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.680]   or better career, I'm trying to give to you
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.220]   the only thing that is worthy of eternity, amen?
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.820]   And that being the case, I wanted to take time tonight
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.340]   to make sure, especially because we have a mission team out
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.420]   trying to evangelize to young people
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.800]   who are in college and younger,
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.740]   especially because our theme of the year
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.940]   is pray and proclaim.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.100]   I want us to make sure that we follow in Christ's
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.180]   heart attitude, that we're willing to suffer
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.740]   just simply the burden of care and sorrow in our heart
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.640]   and the grief in our soul.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.420]   And what's more, we wanna have every intention.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.500]   If some of you guys struggle with things like,
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.700]   oh, I don't know, I don't wanna make my friend believe
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.940]   that all I care about is preaching the gospel,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.980]   yes, you do.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:37.980]   Yes, you do.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   You wanna run the risk of having your friends feel like,
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.020]   did you just become friends with me to share the gospel?
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.220]   Yes, I did.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.940]   Did you take me out to lunch just so that you could
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.780]   share the gospel?
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.700]   Yes, 100%, thank you for noticing.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.780]   Because outside of that, I don't actually have
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.700]   a lot to give you.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.860]   Even my friendship is temporary.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.580]   The love of the community is temporary.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.580]   Outside of the gospel, I have no other intent.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:11.180]   Like, what other intentions that's so grand do I have
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:16.180]   for you other than that you would know my savior, amen?
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.820]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:25.220]   Our God and Father, we pray that you would give to us
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:29.880]   such conviction of the unimaginable weight of the gospel
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   of Christ because he shed his holy blood for us.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.140]   And I pray, Father God, our hearts would cry out.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:44.180]   Our hearts, Lord God, would truly mourn over those
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.300]   who are not saved.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:51.260]   Help us, Father God, to have eyes that are not just physical
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.020]   but truly spiritual and led by your spirit.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:59.100]   That when we check to see if someone is doing well,
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.340]   we're not just simply asking about their jobs.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.060]   Help us, Father God, to make sure that everybody around us
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.300]   will see the light of Christ.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.800]   It is your design that we would carry it.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.520]   It is your design that we would speak it boldly.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.280]   Give us conviction and courage in our day.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.180]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.700]   Okay, at this time, we're gonna do just a shift.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.220]   So those of you guys who are up here,
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.660]   and those of you who wanna come forward,
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.380]   please go ahead and do.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.260]   We're gonna stack away the white chairs upon these dollies.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.260]   And those of you guys who are designated to be helpers,
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.700]   please go on and come up.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.700]   Start stacking away the white chairs here
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:42.540]   so that we have space to roam and space to kneel, okay?
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.580]   We're also gonna put up just a couple points for you guys.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   So give that a second.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.260]   (audience clapping)
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.500]   Okay, good, thank you.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:47.300]   So again, for those of you who want to come forward
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:52.100]   to kneel or to just sit near the front and pray,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.340]   please go ahead and make your transition now.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:59.580]   I wanna encourage you just to really just cry out to God
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.060]   and pray for the people who are in your lives
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.380]   that lift them up by name.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.220]   And again, some of you have been praying for people,
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.340]   especially in your families,
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.260]   who have been praying for a long time.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.340]   Remember, we absolutely first and foremost
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.140]   believe in a sovereign God.
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.500]   There is no place where God is not sovereign.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.780]   And so with hope in our heavenly Father, we pray for them.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.020]   Also, as you guys know, the team in Korea,
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:35.380]   they hit the ground running and their schedule was packed.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.500]   They're right in the middle of their retreat
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.340]   and in this international student retreat,
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.740]   they said that 50% of them are Christians,
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.820]   but 50% of them are not.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.780]   Please pray for fruitful conversations.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.820]   Next week, right after they finish the retreat,
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.980]   they're gonna be doing a lot of street evangelism,
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.420]   but it's the rainy season,
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.300]   and so they're gonna be playing by ear
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.660]   what they can do and what they can't,
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.900]   but please pray that God would,
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.060]   as he said in various parts of scripture,
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.980]   there are people that his spirit is already working on.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.020]   And in that way, we hope that there is
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.380]   some divine appointment for them
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.380]   to have conversations with people
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:15.780]   and that those would be fruitful as well.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.580]   Pastor Peter has mentioned that upon observing and learning,
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.820]   there's been just a lot of opportunities
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.940]   that seem to be available and open,
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.660]   but obviously there has to be discretion
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.820]   and wisdom of what to pursue.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.420]   So also continue to pray for focus, energy, and perseverance.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.980]   As you guys know, we are people beset with weakness
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.980]   and just a little fatigue, lack of sleep, no food,
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.980]   and all of a sudden we can be knocked off our course,
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:46.180]   so let's pray for perseverance and a lot of focus for them.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.340]   What we'll do is, for 15 minutes,
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.380]   please go ahead and pray.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.380]   Pray for your own heart
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.500]   and all the various things that we mentioned.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.340]   After 15 minutes, I'll come back and open it up
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.700]   where our elders and pastors will be up at the front
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.860]   to pray for you, and then after that,
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.340]   we'll end up with the closing praise.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.900]   So while the AV team sets some music in the background,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.980]   let's go ahead and pray.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.540]   I'll say a brief prayer to open us into that time.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:14.460]   Our God, we join together as a church,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.700]   acknowledging, Lord, that you are sovereign
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.580]   over all the earth and universe,
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.080]   and you're sovereign over salvation.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.140]   And so, God, we lift up our prayers to you,
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.900]   and we pray, God, that truly in your mercy,
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.140]   you would hear us.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.420]   In Christ's name, amen.

[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:30.780]   - As you continue to pray,
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.780]   we'll have our elders and pastors come to the front,
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.780]   spread out through the front stage area.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.440]   If you need prayer, please come up and request prayer.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.480]   But also, if you're sitting there at your chair
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.320]   and you need prayer,
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.940]   this is a good time to pray for one another.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.820]   Please go ahead and look to a neighbor
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:54.200]   and pray for each other as you need, okay?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.620]   So let's continue on in our prayer.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.700]   And again, if you need prayer,
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.540]   go ahead and come on up to the front.
