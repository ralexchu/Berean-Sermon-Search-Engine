[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   So, we're talking right now about not just simple Bible inductive study, but because
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   that's going to be something more like a five part series.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.780]   Today we're going to be talking more so about, we're going to be talking more about observations.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.240]   How do you fine tune or just simply improve the method by which you do observation of
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   scripture.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.720]   Now, I love doing things by my hand and like making things like little boxes or tables
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520]   and painting stuff.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.920]   And one thing about creating anything, making anything is that you never finish with one
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.080]   coat, right?
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.280]   Just like with cleaning, anything else that you want a nice fine finish, you don't just
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   do one coat.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.320]   As a matter of fact, recently my wife and I, we made a little table out of plywood and
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.960]   all it is is cheap plywood, 20 bucks for a whole sheet.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.480]   All we did is put polyurethane right over it.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.240]   First coat, all bumpy, bubbly, looks disgusting.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.440]   Second coat, you sand in between, put another coat down and all of a sudden it looks a lot
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440]   better.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.560]   Third and fourth coat, you go in with fine sandpaper and when you finish it, the grain
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.760]   pops, it's reflective, it looks like mirror finish and it looks awesome.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.200]   Likewise, with Bible observations, one reading will never do, two readings won't do, but
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.040]   on multiple layers what you find is there's a beauty that comes out from scripture as
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400]   you look at it again and again.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   Likewise, today we're going to go through a specific passage in Ephesians and we're
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.200]   going to read it several times observing all the stuff that's in there.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.560]   And that's why with multiple layers of observation, people, you will find that the scripture is
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.960]   so deep, scripture is so profound, you could spend your whole life observing the same passage
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.640]   again and again only to glean greater riches.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.160]   If you look at your packets or your handout, there's a section that says just improving
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.080]   observation with multiple, multi-layer observations through, and I give you a little list.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.800]   These are some of the steps that we'll be taking in order for us to improve.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600]   Just running through it really briefly, we always have to start with our simple reading
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   to get the picture.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.320]   If it's a specific text in the New Testament, what's the general picture, what's the narrative?
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.980]   We do second layer by looking at the paragraph and outlining the topics, the major themes.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.320]   We do sentence diagramming or what you call syntactical diagramming to see the relationships
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.440]   between what is said in phrases.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.720]   There's categorizing the different parts of speech, and lastly, getting a good feel of
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   the text.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.760]   We're going to walk through that together.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.840]   Let's take a moment to pray and jump right in.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.720]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.160]   Just as Pastor Aaron mentioned this just earlier, God, it is your grace given to us for us to
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.600]   be able to look and observe your precious word.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   God, you say in your own words, Lord, that your word is bread to us.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   It's sweet like honeycomb.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.360]   And I really pray, Father God, that we would be a people who have enjoyed that, who have
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.440]   tasted to see that it's good.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.040]   And I pray for every single one of us, you continue just to inspire us and God, motivate
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.240]   our hearts, Lord, that we would come to your word.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.520]   Okay.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.640]   What I'd like to do first and foremost is just give you a challenge that when you do
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.880]   your observations, you do want to make sure that you are looking at big picture.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.640]   So on layers of the observations, you want to sometimes do the close look, but you also
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   want to do the big look.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.520]   What I'd like to do is read with you guys together Ephesians.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.760]   Oh wait, sorry.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.520]   What I'd like you to do on your own, not together, is read Ephesians chapter one and two.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.120]   So please take out your Bibles.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.240]   And just to give a little sense of the pressure, you have six minutes to read it.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.360]   So this is not like all crazy, just like detailed observation, but just read chapter one and
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   two.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   And then when you're all done, go ahead and look up and I'm going to give you a minute
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   to just write a few observations on your own.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   Ready?
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   Go ahead.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   [inaudible]
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   [inaudible]

[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   ( baby crying )
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   Okay, there's about a minute left.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   Okay, even if you're not finished reading the two chapters,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   what I'd like you to do now is try to jot down any theme
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   or major teaching that you saw in the next minute.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   But use not full-on sentences, but just about two to three words.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   It could be "love of God," it could be et cetera, et cetera, right?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   Take about a minute from what you just cursory read.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   What themes or major teachings do you recall?
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   Go ahead.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   ( indistinct chatter )
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   Okay, so now that we've done that,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   for us, one of the first--
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   in the process of making good observations,
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   one of the first things we want to do, again,
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   is to read a large portion and then simply see the flow of thought.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   And sometimes when you read, certain things pop out to you,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   and those are highlights.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   But is that the best way to feel like, "Oh, I understand this passage"?
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   No. That's maybe a good way just to have a moment of conviction or devotion,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.240]   but it's not a good way to sit there and say,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   "This is what he, the author, wants me to understand."
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   So in so doing that, one of the very first things we do
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   is we read a big section, and then we start to outline
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   the thought process of the author.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   So here, in point 2, in the next section,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.240]   I have the heading "Paragraph Outlining" or "Topical Outlining."
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   And when we do that, what we're searching for are themes in the Scriptures.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   Many times when people try to outline the Bible,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   they'll use various methods.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   One method is simply to use the paragraphing in the Greek text,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   because just like you guys learn in high school,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   you write your thoughts in terms of paragraphs.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   You have your topic sentence, and then you have your paragraph,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   and you make a new paragraph, and you move into a new thought.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.240]   Well, if you have the ESV and ASV Bible,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   what they'll show you is, it'll show you a number in terms of the verse numbers.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   It'll be bolded based on where the Greek text has a new paragraph.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   Now, is the paragraphing inspired? It's not.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Ancient Greek texts are actually written in Unicode,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   meaning there weren't paragraph break-ins.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   However, much later on, as people, scholars, are looking at the text,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   and they're doing their translations,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   there are clear markers of where their new thought or transition was,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   and they added these paragraph settings.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   So in your Bibles, you have these bold numbers to show you those paragraphs,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   and that way you can break up your sections to study them.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   What I like to say is actually the best thing to do is look for process of thought,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   and think where are the big sections of thought.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Together, I'd like to read this section.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   Again, even though you've already read it, we're going to do multiple, okay?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   I'm going to read this for us here, and it says--
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   I'll just read it off my phone though.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   It says, "Blessed be the God of thought and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.240]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessings in the heavenly places."
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   This is clearly a thematic verse. Why?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   Because everything falling underneath it is simply an extrapolation of that theme verse.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   It says, "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   that we would be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   In love, He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   according to the kind intention of His will.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   To the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us and the beloved.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   In Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   In our wisdom and insight, He made known to us the mystery of His will,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   according to His kind intention, which He purposed in Him.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   With a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   that is the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens, things on the earth.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   according to His purpose, who works all things after the counsel of His will.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   To the end, that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   who was given as a pledge of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   to the praise of His glory.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   Now, what's really interesting is when certain passages of Scripture like this we observe,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   you find a level of repetition and redundancy, right?
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   What I find is that typical pattern when people read sections like that,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.240]   what they remember is just simply the stuff that pops out.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   For example, I remember reading just a Bible help tool that gives you major chapter headings,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   major chapter maybe memorable things, so that you kind of know what's contained in each chapter.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   I asked you guys to read chapter 1 and 2, that Bible tool, it basically said chapter 1, predestination,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   chapter 2, grace of God and gospel, right?
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   And I'm not sure if some of you guys wrote that in terms of your observations or what you recall.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   Chapter 1 seems like it's all about He chose you, okay?
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   Well, obviously the case I'm going to make to you is there's so much more than that.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   If we take a look at the theme, thematics, and then unpack it, there's so much more.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   So, what am I talking about?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   Well, the reason why I'm saying verse 3 is the thematic verse is because everything else supports it,
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   and you can tell because it says at the very beginning, "Just ask."
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   So, here, see I'm doing that here.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   This is a theme verse where it says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   Right?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.240]   You take a moment to think, and in verse 4, he begins by saying, "Just ask,"
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   and all he's doing is extrapolating and giving you examples of what?
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   The spiritual blessings.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   So, we key on this idea of the spiritual blessings right here,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   and we realize we can simply ask the question, "What are these spiritual blessings?"
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   Well, we can walk through it really closely and realize there's so much more than just predestination.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   For example, verse 4, "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,"
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   verse 5, "He predestined to adoption as sons,"
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.240]   verse 7, "In Him we have redemption through His blood,"
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   comma, "the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of His grace."
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   What's more, you have in verse 9, "He made known to us the mystery of His will."
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   Think about that.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   He counts it a spiritual blessing that He will disclose to you information.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   Isn't that what Jesus said?
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   He said, "Because I call you friend."
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   Why do I call you friend?
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   Because I make known to you what I'm going to do.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   I make known to you the plans of the Father.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   What's more, verse 11, "And we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according to His purpose."
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   Over in verse 13, "You are sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit."
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   So, when you make certain of these observations, you realize this is the theme
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   because everything He says contributes to extrapolating what He first said in verse 3.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   So, by quick summary, you have these points and you can make a list.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   I want to challenge you guys, whenever you see repetition in the Scriptures,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   don't get bogged down and say, "Oh man, he's just being overly redundant."
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   I want you to take a piece of paper and start jotting it down.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   Let's make a list.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   Let's count.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   How many blessings is He talking about?
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.240]   Here, you have four just from the first half and another four in the second half.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   That's a total of eight different blessings that Apostle Paul wants the people to recognize.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   Is chapter 1 just about predestination?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.240]   No, it's not.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   He is talking about the incredible, vast, deep array of blessings that God has given to you in the name of Christ.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   So, at this point then, when we do observations of thematics, it helps us see these sections.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   What I'd like to do then is move forward to sentence diagram.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   We're going to take one verse and we're going to diagram it.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   What I've done for you is just sentence 3 is your thematic verse, which yes, you should diagram,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   but I'm going to take verse 4.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   That I have laid out for you on your piece of paper, the handout.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   The way I typically diagram things is by grammatical categories.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   What I mean by that is, you guys remember way back when you learned this is the subject, this is the predicate.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.240]   You're just like, "Oh, so boring," but it actually comes so handy to Bible study.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   So, thank the Lord for all your English teachers.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.240]   What's really important is, actually, I started to learn and in seminary I struggled hard.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   In seminary there was a special class.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   It was not your Greek class or your Hebrew class, but it was your basic English class.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   I had to sign up for it because once I started studying Greek, I was like, "I don't know what they're talking about."
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   They were talking about subjunctive clauses, independent clauses, dependent clauses.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   I said, "No!"
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   I convinced Mia, my buddy.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   He's my roommate.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   He's now a PhD holding.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   He writes books and stuff.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   I was like, "Please take it with me."
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   He's like, "Okay."
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   You know what's so funny is he failed the class.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   I passed and he failed.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   So, he had to take it again.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   But the class taught us everything from not only do you have to understand your subject and predicate,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   but your verb tenses, your commands, your indicatives, all that kind of stuff because it's super important.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   Here, what you have is just simple, the main independent clause is, "He chose us."
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   He chose us.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   And so, sometimes I just automatically do that when I do my Bible study.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   I circle the main verb.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   Get a piece of paper, copy the verse.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.240]   I just circle the main verb in the sentence because that's going to be your starting point.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.240]   Verse 4 is about God's sovereign election.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.240]   He chooses.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   We don't choose Him.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   He chooses.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:37.240]   But there are these dependent clauses that begins either with some kind of preposition, right?
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   And what we find is it says, "In Him, He chose us."
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Then he says, "Before the foundation of the world."
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   And then he says, "That we would be holy and blameless before Him."
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   And all I've done is just broken up those small phrases into these sections, okay?
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   This is called sentence diagram.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   If you were to do this for the whole Bible, yes, it would take a long time.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   And I encourage you though, couple this with your other ways of studying.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.240]   This is not how you, you know, you have to do every single day.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   But couple this with your Bible study, your Bible reading.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   And it's going to show you a lot. Why?
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Because now, I have to, once I diagram it, categorize and identify.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   Remember in our layers?
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   In our layers, I said there's going to be categorization.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   What I mean by that is,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   this is where you sit down and you say, "Okay, He chose us."
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   Clearly, "In Him" is describing how He chose us.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   So I'm sitting here and I've got to ask myself the question,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   "What is that?"
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   "In Him."
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   I could just read it and move on. Or I could ask the question,
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   "Is this just simply the context by which He chose us?"
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   Is He saying this is the means?
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   But that's pretty crazy because if you think about that,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   God's just simply choosing.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   What does it even mean that He would choose us in Christ?
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   Right?
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   What is He saying?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   And so, we have to ask that question as well.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.240]   Here's another question.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   Before the foundation of the world,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   it describes how He chose us.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   So I could just chalk it up as, "It just describes how He chose us."
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   But in greater detail, it describes to us the timing.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   It describes to us the chronology of how He chose.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   So it's just simply a description of the timing.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   Another question.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   The next phrase, "That we would be holy and blameless."
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   I love the word "that"
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   because what it shows me is purpose.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   What it shows me is goal and intent of God.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   He chose that we would be holy and blameless.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   So just taking a moment to think about this,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   recently I had a discussion with some individuals about free grace theology.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   Individuals will say, "You know what?
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   The simple fact is you need to believe Jesus and you're saved.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   For you to teach about holiness,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   sanctification, righteousness in your life,
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   all you're doing is just looking at works, works, works, works, works,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   and you're back-loading it into the gospel.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   There's going to be people who are saved and then they never show it."
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   And you're just kind of like, "Huh?"
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   They're like, "Yeah, Romans says it's not by works.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   Ephesians says it's not by works.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   You have to know that you just saved and that's it."
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   I'm going to look to Ephesians and say, "You know what?
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   I was studying this verse, verse 4.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   It says He chose us that we would be holy.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   So you can tell me what you want, but look at this passage.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   What do I do with this?"
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   He tells you that in God's plan,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   His purpose was to redeem you and save you
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   and choose you to be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   There you go, right?
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   So even in theology, some of this helps a lot
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   because it shows you that kind of relationship.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   And then lastly, you know what?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   I totally forgot I had a slide for this.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   Oh, no wait.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   I don't have a slide for this.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   Okay.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   Yeah, okay.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.240]   So here, lastly, the little phrase before Him,
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   the holiness that we are to be is in reference, okay?
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Is in reference to God.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   So what I did just right there is I did sentence diagramming
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   to show you the relationship between the main subject
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   and the main verb.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   And then every phrase that comes afterneath it,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   I gave it its weight by doing what?
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   Asking the question, "How does this connect?
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   What is the relationship between these things?"
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   And then I started to identify, "Wow.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   He is focusing on this choosing and telling us
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   maybe the means and the source and the person of Christ,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   the timing of it, the purpose of it,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   and the context and reference that we should have."
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   Right?
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.240]   That's a lot to think about.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   What I'd like you guys to do, just take a moment,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   is take a look at verse 5.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   You know what?
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   Sorry, I'm getting a little mixed up
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   because I remember I made a slide though.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   Okay, yeah, I did.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   All right.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   Okay, okay, I see what I did there.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.240]   Okay, so I was supposed to have this up
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   while I was going through that.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   But giving you those relationships,
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   you ask those categories of what is this.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.240]   And in that, it really helps your observation.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   Okay?
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   What I'd like you guys to do is just take four minutes.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   Okay?
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.240]   Just take four minutes and take a look at verse 5.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   And in the space provided,
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   I want you guys to divide the scripture
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   in the sense that you're going to piece it
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   in every phrase that Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   give it its legitimate weight.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   Okay?
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   And then do your best attempt to answer the question,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   "What is this phrase?"
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   How is it contributing to the main verb?
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   Go ahead, take your time to do that.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   All right.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   All right.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   [ Laughter ]
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   [ Laughter ]
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   [ Laughter ]

[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.840]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:23.800]   - Okay, good.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.760]   Seems like most of you guys might be done.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.920]   If you're not, I apologize.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.480]   Again, you gave me an hour to do something
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.560]   that I know takes a bit long.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.480]   But just kind of encourage you guys again
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.360]   to get in the practice of these kind of observations.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.560]   I wanna share with you, in the beginning,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.000]   when I started to prepare sermons,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.800]   it was super difficult because I felt like
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   I needed to, again, just find profound things.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.760]   You want your sermon to be good,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.040]   so you want it to be like, yeah, right?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.080]   But then, once I started studying the Bible this way,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.520]   I realized I was just so confident
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.600]   I'm never gonna run out of stuff that's profound.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.880]   Because take a look, this is how I prepare my sermon.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.560]   I said, take a look at verse four.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.160]   Here's my outline for my sermon.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.240]   Main sermon, the title, it's like,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.360]   we want you to know that God has chosen you.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.400]   And then say, in Christ.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.160]   Now, if I don't understand, I put question marks
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.800]   'cause that could be theologically pretty huge.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   Put question marks and I'd pray about it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.840]   God, I know that we have to be, in Christ, genuinely chosen.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.720]   I know that preparation for us to be united with Christ
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.800]   is there, and everything that's true of us
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   comes because our identity is one with Him, right?
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.880]   Everything hinges on your union with Christ.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.040]   Boom, there's my second point of my sermon.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.520]   Second point, or third point,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.800]   You could just gloss over that, but, oh my goodness.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.920]   This is revealing of the nature of our God, right?
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   That, if you think about it, the only person
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.520]   who's thought of me for a long, long time is my parents.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.480]   And as I'm a parent, I know that parents think
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.200]   long before even the child arrives.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.640]   They prepare the child's room before the child ever arrives.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.400]   They prepare for the child's space,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.080]   and even purchase car seats to take home the child
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.400]   from the hospital.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.360]   People who care that much for any individual
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.800]   is uniquely parents.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.160]   And I think about God and this idea
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.400]   of before even your existence, you know, He thought of me.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.720]   That's quite amazing.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.600]   That we would be holy, the purpose behind it.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.840]   So I could just, title of the next point of the sermon,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.800]   the purpose of your, you know?
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.880]   That's how I prepare my sermons now.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.360]   The scripture is dictating how my outline goes, okay?
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.320]   So now, we look at the next verse, verse five.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.720]   This is the way I've done it.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.080]   It's again, He has one topic in His main verb,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.960]   the predestination, and He says, "He predestined us."
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.920]   How?
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.760]   In love.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.640]   For what?
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.880]   To the adoptions as sons.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.720]   Through what means?
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.320]   Through Jesus Christ.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.840]   To Himself.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.440]   And then it says, "According to the kind intention
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.280]   "of His will."
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.120]   Apologize, this is so small.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.680]   I should've just put it on here, pack it.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.120]   But it's all in the verse, right?
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.480]   All I did was just piece it up.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.200]   And then lastly, it says, "To the praise of the glory
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.120]   "of His grace."
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.840]   Not right now, but I wanna challenge you.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.400]   This is where you have to sit and start wrestling,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.880]   start categorizing.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.640]   Every one of those small phrases,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   how does it contribute to the concept of predestination,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.320]   and what relationship does it have?
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.160]   Sometimes, the preposition or the word
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.840]   that begins that clause is gonna tell you
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.120]   exactly what He means.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.800]   This is through Jesus Christ, this is the means
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.160]   by which Christ has done it.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.840]   He predestines, right?
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.600]   In this way, we find that there is an incredible amount,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.920]   right, incredible amount of information
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.360]   that Apostle Paul gives in this section.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.560]   What I'd like to do is just real quickly
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.640]   walk with you through the verse again
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.560]   and highlight one of those things.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.000]   You recall, right here, as you start reading,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.400]   "Blessed be the God of our Father,
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.360]   "our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.720]   "with every spiritual blessing
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.160]   "from the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.320]   That was our theme verse, right?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.200]   And so, you start seeing the extrapolation of that.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.560]   "Just as He chose us in Him," verse five,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.120]   "in love He predestined us to adoption as sons
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.280]   "through Jesus Christ," verse six,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.040]   "to the praise of the glory of His grace,
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.680]   "which He freely bestowed on us in the beloved."
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.760]   In Him, we have redemption through His blood.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.080]   "In all wisdom and insight,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.160]   "He made known to us the mystery of His will
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.600]   "according to His kind attention,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.000]   "which He purposed in Him,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.600]   "with a view to an administration
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.340]   "suitable to the fullness of the times,
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.520]   "that is, the summing up of all things in Christ."
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.600]   Jumping to verse 11,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.160]   "In Him also we have obtained an inheritance."
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.720]   Jumping to verse 12, "In Christ," sorry,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.280]   "to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.220]   "would be the praise of His glory.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.600]   "In Him you also, after listening to the message of truth,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.380]   "the gospel of your salvation,
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.880]   "having also believed, you were sealed in Him."
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.020]   So actually, given the fact that we've just highlighted
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.240]   the concept of our blessings being in Christ,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.160]   this section is not primarily about predestination, is it?
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.760]   It's actually more so about the fact
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.820]   that the blessings we have is completely in our seat.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.440]   Everything from beginning, middle, and end
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.560]   is accomplished through Christ, right?
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.320]   Actually, if you think about the blessings
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.000]   and you've kind of meditated upon the elements,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.620]   what kind of blessings are these, right?
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.360]   Does it not include the very beginning,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.200]   but also the sealing of the Spirit
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.360]   to the ultimate inheritance?
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.760]   It does.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.080]   So what you can conclude is like,
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.040]   oh my goodness, everything,
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.200]   before it even began to the very end, is in Christ.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.940]   That's what we observe, okay?
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.060]   All right, now moving forward,
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   here's something interesting we must do.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:24.100]   Once we have the first observation of reading through
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.100]   and getting a sense of the whole picture,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.620]   and then we do an observation of that outline,
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.800]   what's the thought process based on these paragraphs?
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.740]   And then we get even more detailed
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.020]   and do sentence diagram of syntax.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.900]   What are the relationships?
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.760]   We should be really feeling the text, okay?
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.320]   And what do I mean by that is,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.980]   feeling the text might not seem to you
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.260]   as initially just a good observation.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.180]   It might be like, oh, are you asking
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.780]   for impressions and stuff?
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.020]   No, what I'm asking is, you have to observe
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   what is Apostle Paul emphasizing to you, right?
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.000]   Clearly, Apostle Paul wants you to understand something,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.340]   and he's going to, at this point,
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.360]   use a literary device of repeating a concept
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.340]   in a certain structure multiple times.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.100]   Every time he brings up a blessing,
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.380]   he's doing the same thing, isn't he?
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.220]   He chose you, he predestined you, da-da-da,
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.820]   and then he's gonna surround that with the source,
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.940]   the means, the purpose, you see what I'm saying?
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.020]   So through the literary device of repetition,
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.340]   he is emphasizing a lot to us.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.620]   And that's where we have to ask the question about,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.580]   you know, what do I observe
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.480]   as the main thrust of the passage, yes?
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.500]   Okay, I'm gonna make the case
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.180]   that there is another repetitive concept
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.180]   that Apostle Paul is emphasizing to us,
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.540]   and I'm gonna go to the verse again
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.700]   and highlight something different.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   If you noticed, okay, some of these little
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.500]   prepositional phrases, in love, according to,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.540]   it's like a weird chop, right?
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.780]   But I think there's an element of intentionality
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.360]   behind that, because there's an emphasis there.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.720]   But let's read through the passage,
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.600]   and I'm gonna read this time without skipping anything,
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.220]   and I'm gonna highlight to you,
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.360]   not simply just like, you know, the context,
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.760]   the purpose, whatever, but the manner
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.400]   by which God has done this.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.160]   Okay, that's the way I've categorized it.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.960]   The manner by which God has done this.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.760]   So, from the beginning, okay?
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.560]   And I'll just, in front of me so I'm not turned around.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.980]   Verse three says, "Blessed be the God,
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.200]   "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.980]   "who has blessed us with every spiritual blessings
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.540]   "in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.940]   "Just as he chose us in him before the foundation
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.260]   "of the world, that we would be holy
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.460]   "and blameless before him."
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.300]   Here it is.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.860]   "In love, he predestined us to adoption
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.720]   "as sons through Jesus Christ to himself,"
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.980]   listen to this, "according to the kind intention
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.120]   "of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.020]   "which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.140]   "In him we have redemption through his blood,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.100]   "the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.340]   "and again, according to the riches of his grace,
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.700]   "which he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight,
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.480]   "he made known to us the mystery of his will,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.960]   "according to his kind intention,
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.620]   "which he purposed in him.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.660]   "With a view to an administration suitable
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.420]   "to the fullness of the times,
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.300]   "that is the summing up of all things in Christ."
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.040]   Things in the heavens, the things on earth.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.200]   "In him also we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.800]   "having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.380]   "who works all things after the counsel of his will,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.720]   "to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.140]   "would be to the praise of his glory.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.000]   "In him you also, after listening to the message of truth,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.160]   "the gospel of your salvation,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.340]   "having also believed, you were sealed in him
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.360]   "with the Holy Spirit of promise,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.760]   "who was given as a pledge of our inheritance,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.980]   "with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   "to the praise of his glory."
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.960]   You notice I highlighted in green some of these words,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.660]   and I'm gonna list it off for you.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.500]   Oh, sorry, there's one more little section here
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.600]   I wanna read.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.720]   Down in verse 18 it says,
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.700]   "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.540]   "so that you will know what is the hope of his coming,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.520]   "what are the riches of the glory of an inheritance
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.280]   "in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.600]   "of his power toward us who believe.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.760]   "These are in accordance with the working
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.580]   "of the strength of his might,
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.140]   "which he brought about in Christ
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.180]   "when he raised him from the dead,
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.420]   "and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places."
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.260]   So let's take a moment to meditate on this.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.660]   And again, what I would probably do
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.060]   when I'm studying this is, oh my goodness,
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.600]   there has been an incredible repetition
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.940]   of the manner by which God has blessed us, yes?
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.220]   And there is clearly an emphatic repetition about this
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.960]   because he uses the same exact terminology multiple times.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.700]   And what's more, if I read chapters one through three,
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.140]   what Apostle Paul is gonna say repeatedly
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.240]   is I pray you understand his love.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.700]   I pray you understand his grace to you, right?
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.720]   I pray you understand the width, the height, the breadth,
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.380]   everything about how much he loves you.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.460]   And so, with the theme verse being,
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.620]   and look at how much God has blessed you,
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.220]   we look at the manner of which he loved us.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.420]   I would list it off on a piece of paper,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.700]   and then I would start meditating.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.540]   Oh my goodness.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.860]   Everything that he said he's done,
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.080]   he's done in accordance with his kind intention.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.300]   The blessings that he's listed off there,
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.080]   that's not exhaustive.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.300]   But what he's highlighting is how he freely gave that to you.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.060]   What he's highlighting is how he lavishly poured out upon you.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.140]   What he's highlighting is how incredibly wise he was
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.580]   to do this for you.
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.180]   What he's highlighting is how much he loved you,
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.340]   that he would do this according to the power of his might.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.100]   That to me is amazing.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.620]   And I recall, like, when you start thinking about that,
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.220]   that his mind is involved with this,
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.740]   his heart is involved with this,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.940]   his intentionality is involved with this,
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.060]   I started recalling, like,
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.740]   when was the last time you saw those words
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.700]   all pieced together?
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.260]   It was God commanding us,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.460]   you need to love God with all your heart,
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.540]   soul, mind, and strength, right?
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.260]   And then I sit there and I'm just like, wow.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.740]   God loved us with his might,
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.140]   with his mind, with his soul, with his heart.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.300]   And he lavished his blessings upon us.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.060]   If ever, you know, there was a case,
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.180]   a scenario where there's, you know,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.060]   a woman and a man who's involved in a romantic relationship,
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.300]   and there's ever a strife, you know,
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.900]   there's a lot of dissatisfaction, why?
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.620]   Because sometimes men do things,
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.820]   and there's no thought behind it,
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.900]   it's like, oh, it's your birthday,
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.980]   let's go out and eat something nice, right?
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.860]   And then the woman's all disappointed, like,
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.540]   oh, you didn't give any thought behind it,
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.260]   we just eat every time, you know?
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.660]   And, you know, sometimes when we think about,
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.980]   like, again, ways that we have desired
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.500]   to receive love and affection,
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.780]   I want you to take a moment to think about,
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.820]   we have here God expressing,
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:45.220]   that he had us in mind and in view.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.500]   This is not, like, sappy lovey-dovey stuff,
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.700]   this is reality of how deep God's love is.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.980]   The reason why I've highlighted these weird concepts of,
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.500]   in view of the plan for the fullness of times,
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.100]   with view of the redemption of God's own possession.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.660]   God is not a God who, as he was accomplishing his plan,
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.060]   lost sight of it.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:12.020]   God is not a God who, as time went on,
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.220]   as people were super sinful, and they rejected him,
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.540]   completely lost sight of it.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.740]   But rather, he is a God with immense intentionality.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.260]   He's a God with perfect foresight.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.700]   But what's more, he's a God with perfect power.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.180]   And through all those means, he's blessed us,
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.660]   front, middle, and end.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.380]   Front, middle, end, right?
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.420]   This passage is not just about
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.100]   one way he's loved us in predestination,
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.900]   this passage is about the immense way in which
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.700]   God the Father has blessed you
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.420]   with every spiritual blessing in the world.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.300]   And that's what we're gonna do in this passage.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   We're gonna talk about the commandment of Christ.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.620]   So what is Apostle Paul's command in chapter one?
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.900]   His command is, bless the Lord.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   Chapter one is actually a command for every single Christian
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.140]   to bless and worship God.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.500]   And that begins the whole trail
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.860]   of what he's gonna talk about in chapter two,
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.940]   and I'm not gonna go into the work and stuff, no.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.820]   Chapter two is all about how he has taken you
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.140]   who are far off, who are far from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.900]   you who had no God, he's brought you near.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.620]   And you who are dead, he's given you life, right?
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.500]   There's so much more that we can observe
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.260]   from these passages when we see
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.460]   what Apostle Paul is doing in his train of thought.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.660]   So, couple things here.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.940]   Today, again, remember, it was not just
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.460]   a Bible study, but it's about giving careful attention
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.660]   to observe what the passage has to give you.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.740]   By way of review, look broadly at the whole context
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.500]   by reading a lot.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.580]   Secondly, outline by process of thought.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.460]   Sometimes it's already given to you by paragraphs.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.660]   Look for theme verses.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.580]   Thirdly, take each sentence and break it down
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.740]   into grammatical syntax.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.020]   How does one phrase relate to another phrase?
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.180]   And it shows you the relationships.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.380]   Once you see those relationships,
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.860]   typically you will see a pattern.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.780]   You'll see a pattern where Apostle Paul
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   or whoever is writing, especially with these letters,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.240]   are going to emphasize certain things to you.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.660]   If you're reading in the Old Testament
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.980]   and you're reading a bunch of narratives,
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.300]   you have to categorize, hey, I'm not gonna be able
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.020]   to break it down like this, but I will be able
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.700]   to observe categorically, is this section
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.500]   the twist in the plot?
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.420]   Is this section the end conclusion of that?
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.740]   Is there a resolve?
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.540]   Is there a climax of the conflict in the story?
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.960]   And you get to categorize different parts of the narrative.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.880]   And then lastly, once you see the emphasis,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.220]   you can start making your summary.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.580]   Oh, I think I get the heart of this passage.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.420]   I think I understand the command, right?
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.100]   I think I understand what he's driving you towards.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.100]   And when you understand that,
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.560]   then you can make your conclusions.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.740]   Then you can sit there and be like,
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.940]   oh man, how do I apply this, right?
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.980]   Because if you understand predestination
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.740]   out of the context of his love,
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.020]   it's going to be to you, oh, what?
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.860]   How does that work with my free will?
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.100]   The point of him telling you he's predestined you
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.900]   is to show you how much he's lavished his love on you.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.740]   Don't question predestination.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.940]   It's his love for you, right?
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.480]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.260]   Okay, with that said, I hope that was an encouragement
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.500]   and a challenge to you of how to make better observations
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.500]   of the scriptures.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.900]   If you guys have questions, please let me know.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.740]   But there's a couple things I want to say
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.920]   in terms of takeaways in thinking about that, okay?
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.180]   Nice, always forget some part of life.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.640]   God has blessed us with his love,
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.580]   which he poured out with his might, power,
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   wisdom, insight, intention, and will, okay?
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.340]   Bless the Lord, amen.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.260]   Now, a couple things to think about, okay?
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.900]   At Berean, you know, again, this is tied
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.940]   to our second vision.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:16.180]   Berean is not the one expecting you to observe scripture.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.460]   It's God, yes?
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.300]   But sometimes I feel a timidity within people
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.020]   who are thinking, like, I know,
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.300]   but like, interpretation's hard.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.620]   I'm gonna tell you honestly,
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.340]   the vast majority of scripture is not hard to interpret.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.260]   It's not.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.940]   Are there very difficult portions of scripture
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.060]   that are hard to interpret?
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:35.980]   Like, what is this?
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.260]   Yes, there are.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.820]   But the vast majority of scripture is repetitive, right?
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.180]   The vast majority of scripture,
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.220]   and we believe in the perspicuity of scripture,
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.740]   meaning the clarity of scripture
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.800]   that's going to be evident to you.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.700]   There's a normal reading where you read it
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.860]   because it was meant for you to understand.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.220]   Should we be submitted to Christ
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.240]   and have the Holy Spirit?
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.340]   God wants you to know.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.920]   And the reason, and the encouragement I want to give to you
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.860]   is if you have that timidity,
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.540]   don't think, like, oh my goodness,
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.980]   I have to be, like, you know, a scholar in this,
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.260]   and I'm gonna have to read all these commentaries,
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.340]   and I have to interpret this
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.140]   based on the four different views.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.480]   Wrong.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.020]   What I want you to do is think,
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.300]   I have to read this over and over and over again,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.300]   and all I'm doing is summarizing my observation, right?
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.740]   It's that simple.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.780]   What you're doing is you're doing
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.440]   multiple layers of observation,
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.180]   and you're summarizing your observation,
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.540]   saying, hey, this is what I saw.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.220]   What I saw was that in every blessing that we have,
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.780]   there was an incredible intentionality
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.380]   that this is all to the praise of God.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.820]   That's a great, great observation.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.420]   And therefore, whatever you argue with another individual
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.020]   is derived from your observation of the text.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.740]   That's how it needs to operate,
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.700]   not just on a church-wide level in preaching,
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.020]   but that's how it needs to operate
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.140]   in the individual level in your own Bible study.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.780]   Everything needs to be from your own observation
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.800]   in what you see in the scripture, okay?
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.900]   And since Pastor Aaron gave us a great message
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.940]   on what is expository preaching,
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.860]   I'm not gonna go into that in detail,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.220]   but again, even the way you expect,
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.100]   I just wanna say this, though.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.100]   Even in the way that you expect
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.020]   expository preaching to happen,
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.020]   there's been this kind of weird, I don't know,
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.820]   like expectation that expository preaching
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.420]   should have with it, Greek grammar,
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.740]   and to say like, oh yeah, you know,
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.180]   this word, epiphemia or whatever, means this,
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.020]   and then you're like, oh yeah,
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.260]   expository preaching, let's go, right?
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.420]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.500]   Expository preaching is just simply
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.180]   to expose to you that observation.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.380]   And earlier, when I talked to you
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.740]   about finding the relationship between
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.700]   not only the syntax, but the paragraph to paragraph,
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.400]   and the pastor exposes that to you,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.820]   that's expository preaching.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.100]   When you're going through the text
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.020]   and emphasizing what the passage emphasizes to you.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.420]   The reason why I say that is because
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.900]   within Bible teaching churches,
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:09.900]   what I find is there is a diminishing
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.020]   and reducing and oversimplification
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.780]   of expository preaching as it needs to make sure
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.900]   that every single word is accounted for, and that's it.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.600]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.580]   Good expository preaching should emphasize to you,
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.540]   sometimes it'll sort you and convict you,
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.260]   sometimes it'll break you and make you cry, right?
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.940]   Sometimes it'll make you so emotional
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:34.620]   you don't know what to do with yourself,
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.260]   sometimes it'll make you so hopeful
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.540]   you'll just be like, coming out with a smile on your face.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.700]   That's all dependent on what?
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.620]   The content of the passage.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.700]   So expository sermons will not look
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.580]   exactly the same one to another.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.780]   And we kind of have to understand that
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.020]   because I feel like within Bible teaching churches,
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.980]   there is a misconception that expository sermons
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.620]   has to look exactly this way.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.140]   It's not true.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.020]   Expository sermons should actually reveal to you
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.340]   the relationships, the emphasis,
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.460]   and the heart behind the passage, okay?
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.100]   Let's take a moment to pray and wrap up our session.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:17.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God,
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.220]   that today we got to take a look at Eden's chapter one.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.940]   And Lord, we want to say, God,
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.900]   we have been so blessed by you.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.580]   We have been so thoroughly loved by you.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.060]   And God, we want to thank you.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.780]   Lord, we recognize that oftentimes,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.380]   just as children don't appreciate
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.220]   because we just don't see what we weren't alive for.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.340]   We don't see what you're doing sometimes
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.300]   without our eyes seeing.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.700]   But God, as you reveal it to us in the scripture,
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.300]   we believe it and we want to thank you so much.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.380]   I pray, Father God, that as you have given us then
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.260]   the revelation of your will,
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.940]   you've given us the intent of your heart,
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.180]   you've given us your own longing
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.140]   to have us as your possession.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.900]   We just want to respond by saying, God,
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:11.340]   we give you all of ourselves and we love you.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.260]   And although, Father God, we repent of the fact
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.420]   that sometimes our love is so weak,
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.500]   we want to love you all the more.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.340]   And I pray we would do that
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.580]   by carefully searching for you in your scripture.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.380]   We thank you, it's in Christ, let me pray.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.220]   Amen.
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.060]   - Amen.
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:26.900]   - Okay, thanks everyone.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.180]   You guys are dismissed for the next.
