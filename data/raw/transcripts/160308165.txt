[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.880]   About verse 7. I'm gonna turn there in my Bible too. Okay. Just to begin, I think the way I
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.520]   would like to think of and frame what the events that happened on Thursday.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.920]   Thursday is a day of preparation. Thursday is a day of preparation which
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.160]   we began in Luke 22 with Jesus instructing the disciples to prepare for
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.760]   the Passover. This momentous occasion for every Jew of the nation of Israel to
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.600]   remember and to celebrate that God in his love delivered the nation of Israel
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.640]   from the oppression that existed in Egypt but more so the wrath of God that
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.680]   was going to come upon all the people there. And as Jesus is preparing the
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.920]   disciples to have this Passover with them, Jesus is also preparing the
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.160]   disciples for what's to come. And what's more I believe Jesus is this day is a
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.200]   time in which Jesus is preparing even his own heart. Jesus is preparing even in
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.880]   his own self for the suffering that's to come. And then as we know what's gonna
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.600]   happen later into the evening as they have the Passover, as they have the Last
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.880]   Supper, as Jesus instructs the disciples to prepare them and that even Christ
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.240]   will go to the garden to pray before God, this day is a day of preparation. Now
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560]   what's interesting though is as Jesus instructs the disciples in Luke chapter
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.120]   22 to go and make preparation with the celebration, to grab the materials, to
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.280]   secure the location and all sorts of things, we realize something that Jesus
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.000]   says that reveals his heart. So if you look down, I'll just start reading from
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.440]   verse let's say 14. Okay, verse 14, short passage here where it says, "When the hour
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.880]   had come he reclined at the table and the Apostles with him and he said to
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.800]   them, 'I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.320]   for I say to you I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   of God.'" Now what's very interesting about this passage is in this time of
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.160]   preparation Jesus reveals his heart. He says, you know, we're having this
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200]   Passover but it is my earnest desire to eat this with you. And what's very
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.560]   interesting about that is the construction makes it incredibly
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   emphatic. He uses the same word in the Greek epithumia twice but one in
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.960]   an adverb sense and one in the verb putting it together doubly emphasizing I
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   have strongly desired to have this with you. And what's more this term epithumia
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   is often used in other passages. Apostle Paul uses it synonymous with lust,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.160]   something that you're craving, something that you're like you cannot let go of
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.520]   almost. So here's a question, why? Why would Jesus Christ want to have this
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   Passover with them prior to the suffering? Christ is on his route to
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.920]   incredible pain, to his sacrifice. Why does he so desire to have this meal with
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.040]   them prior to doing all that? And my case is going to be that right now we're
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.680]   taking a look at a narrow portion of what happens on Thursday. There's so much
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.400]   that happens on Thursday but we're taking a narrow portion to realize the
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.680]   heart of Christ for his disciples. You know what's really interesting is Jesus
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   telling his disciples and explaining I want to share this with you. I want to
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.640]   have this time with you and I'm not gonna have this again essentially what
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   he's saying. He's describing and pouring out his heart, having a heart-to-heart
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.560]   with them, essentially preparing them and saying I'm going away, right? I'm going
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.800]   away. And as with a lot of other occasions in the Bible, the disciples
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.480]   don't get it. Later on in the passage I'm just gonna summarize for you a little
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.280]   bit but starting from about verse 22 Jesus Christ is explaining to them in
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.360]   greater detail what must take place and why all these things must happen. But
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.520]   starting from verse 44, I'm sorry from verse 24, the disciples actually began to
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.360]   argue with each other and what they argue is which one of us are greater? If
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.680]   this is the time when Jesus is kind of culminating all things about the things
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.440]   that were prophesied and promised then that means we're all gonna be kings. You
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.360]   know the disciples were more so thinking about their position. They're vying for
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.080]   positions of authority, positions of stature and glory. All while Christ was
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.240]   trying to explain to them I really really want to have this time with you.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   And I ask the question why? Why would Jesus Christ want to have this time with
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.760]   them? If you guys have ever cooked a meal, you know, whether it's for family, for
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.440]   friends or roommates, whatever it may be. If you've ever cooked a meal but then
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.560]   nobody comes to the table, you're just like forget it I'm gonna dump this in
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.600]   the trash, you know. If you've ever began a conversation or started telling a
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.800]   story and you realize they're just on their phone and they're not listening,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.920]   forget it. I don't want to go on with the story. This scenario is a lot like many
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   other scenarios where Christ is pouring out his heart. He's describing to them
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.080]   what kind of suffering he needs to endure and how he's fulfilling all that
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.200]   is promised. These are like epic things but the disciples don't get it and when
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.480]   I see that I ask this question why? And the answer really is it's not so much
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.000]   what this event affords for Christ but this is the heart of Christ desiring so
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.480]   eagerly to prepare his children, his disciples. What I see for me is a lot
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.640]   like when a parent is about to leave their children for a long trip or if you
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.600]   know if a child is going away for a college, if a child is going away on a
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.200]   long trip and the parent is so eager wanting to come over and say hey did you
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.520]   check the pressure of your tires? Did you have enough oil? Do you have snacks for the
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.920]   ride? Do you know where you're going? Do you have directions? Do you have a map?
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.720]   And it's just this non-stop like do you have everything? You see that heart of
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.900]   Christ when he's looking at his disciples. I want so eagerly to have this
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.800]   with you. I want to prepare you. And so if you go over to the book of John that's
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.400]   exactly what happens. We're starting from probably the end of chapter 12 or
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.920]   chapter 13 all the way to chapter 17 is many chapters revealing to us the heart
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.960]   of Christ and his love for the disciples. So eagerly wanting to prepare them and
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.800]   to show them what to expect to give them his heart, to give them prayer, to give
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.240]   them love, to give them an appropriate expectation of each other even. An
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.800]   appropriate expectation of the world. And what you see is a revealing of his
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.280]   heart and how he desires to love his disciples. And what I really love
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.480]   about this passage if you turn your Bibles to John chapter 13 is at the
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.040]   beginning of this time in which Jesus has this last supper with his disciples
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.800]   and he prepares them by teaching them the scriptures commentate on Christ's
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   heart for them. And if you take a look first chapter 13 verse 1 he says now
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.160]   before the feast of the Passover Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.880]   would part out he would depart out of this world to the Father having loved
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:09.680]   his own who were in the world he loved them to the end. What a amazing short
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:16.420]   little commentary on what Christ is doing this day on Thursday. His loving
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.640]   his disciples and while they don't get it while they're fighting for position
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.800]   Christ is loving them and he explains to them I am I am here serving you. And so
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.680]   in the next passages of John he's gonna wash the disciples feet showing them
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:36.920]   aren't I greater aren't I the teacher but here I am serving you. And I'm gonna
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.360]   do this thing with you a little bit just summarizing by taking a look and
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.040]   flipping through the chapters a little bit and looking at certain verses that
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.280]   reveals more of Christ's heart of love for them. If you look over at chapter 13
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.040]   verse 31 through 35 he instructs them therefore when he had gone out Jesus said
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.640]   now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.880]   in him God would also glorify him in himself and will glorify him immediately
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   little children I am with you a little while longer you will seek me and as I
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.400]   said to the Jews now I also say to you where I'm going you cannot come but a
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.960]   new commandment I give to you that you love one another even as I loved you
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.360]   that you also love one another by this all men will know that you are my
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.120]   disciples if you love one another. Just like when a parent is leaving and
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.280]   departing for some time he will tell the brothers up in the home you need to love
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.440]   each other take care of each other scroll down to chapter 14 verse 1 and
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.120]   says do not let your heart be troubled believe in God believe also in me as he's
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.920]   departing he understands that even though they don't get it right now that
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.000]   he's leaving that they are going to be troubled they are going to be dismayed
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.480]   they're gonna be in chaos but he instructs them don't be troubled. If you
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.400]   look over in verse 18 of chapter 14 verse 18 he says I will not leave you
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   as orphans I will come to you after a little while the world no longer see me
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   but you will see me because I live you will also live and as you know in this
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.720]   and the gospel of John this is where he just tries to describe to the
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.280]   disciples look it's almost better for me to go because the helper is going to be
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   sent to you I truly won't leave you alone the helper is gonna come and teach
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   you and then later on in chapter 15 he instructs the disciples to abide in him
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.240]   in verse 1 he says I am the vine and my father is a vine dresser and he just
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.720]   describes the scenario in which they need to make sure that they are rooted
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   in him and then in chapter 15 verse 18 he describes how the world is going to
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.440]   treat them what they're supposed to expect that as he departs how the world
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.240]   is going to persecute them to hate them and then in chapter 16 verse 1 this is
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.880]   what Christ says to them verse 1 he says these things I have spoken to you so
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.040]   that you may be kept from stumbling go to verse 4 but these things I have
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   spoken to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.760]   of them that these things I do not say to you at the beginning because I was
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.240]   with you first five but now I'm going to him who sent me and none of you asked
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.120]   me where are you going but because I said these things to you sorrow has
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   filled your heart but I tell you the truth it is to your advantage that I go
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.320]   away for if I do not go away the helper when I come to you but if I go I will
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.600]   send him to you I hope that little exercise shows to you the heart of
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:53.520]   Christ to me that's that's profound because we typically think of Christ as
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:01.340]   like God divine who never worries we typically think of Christ as the you
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.720]   know the God of the world who knows all things who knows the beginning in the
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.240]   end and so he never worries but what I see in Christ's heart for his disciples
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.280]   as he departs as he so eagerly desired to have this Passover so that he might
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.120]   instruct and love his disciples and prepare them and what I see then is a
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.200]   heart of perhaps a parent who is so concerned and in love with his disciples
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.280]   he can't just leave parents when they leave a house you know sometimes we ask
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.360]   people to come to the house and and babysit our kids the first couple times
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.840]   we did that we couldn't leave we're at the door like okay guys listen to the
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.200]   babysitters you know you just go through all this list and you tell us and
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.720]   compelled babysitter okay we have this schedule you have to make sure they eat
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.600]   this thing and you have to do this thing and you just keep going why because
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.200]   your heart of love for your child can't just leave and then when I see Christ
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.920]   almost it through all these verses so concerned for the disciples I just kind
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   of go through that emotion like yes I know Christ is divine but look at his
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:19.400]   heart of love he's so concerned from them and sometimes I have worries I have
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.560]   worries for my children I have worries for our church people I have worries
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:29.400]   for you guys and it just keeps me up and that's a heavy burden to carry but
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.320]   Christ and his love for them scripture says he loves him to the end he carries
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.840]   that burden to the end and what's more profound to me is this in this moment
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.520]   and in this distance does Christ not have concern for his own life does
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:50.280]   Christ not have right to be worried I'm gonna suffer scripture says that he that
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.520]   his heart as a matter of fact is troubled and that is stirred within him
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:01.120]   almost like a storm on the insides does he not have a right to be like
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.440]   disciples you don't care about me who's gonna be with me who's gonna encourage
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.720]   me and strengthen me as I go to the cross but he loves his disciples so much
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.960]   he is concerned over them and his heart is revealed as he so eagerly desires to
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.520]   prepare them but I want to leave you with this but our Lord truly is divine
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.960]   and if you look over in chapter 17 what he does is he's praised to the father
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:37.200]   and he places his disciples in the place that is most secure and the place that
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.680]   is absolutely grounded and that is in the hands of God if you look over at
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.840]   verse 11 of chapter 17 he says this I am no longer in the world he knows he's
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.540]   going to depart and it says yet they themselves are in the world and I come
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.880]   to you Holy Father keep them in your name the name with which you have given
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.560]   me that they may be one as we are while I was with them I was keeping them in
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.960]   your name which you have given me and I've guarded them and not one of them
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.360]   have perished but the son of perdition so that the scriptures would be
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.760]   fulfilled a short little verse tells me this that Christ and his love guarded
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.320]   the disciples all the way through they might not have seen it they might not
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.600]   have understood but since the beginning Christ has guarded them and the only
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   reason why they didn't fall it because of the love of Christ and here and now
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.760]   as he's about to depart where does he place them he places them in the
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.880]   protection of God Almighty what an amazing scene of Christ preparation of
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.720]   the disciples but more so revealing the heart of Christ I think for us it just
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.640]   behooves us that you know a lot of times when we remember each year you know the
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.880]   disciples had Passover each year but they kind of didn't get it as we
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.720]   remember each year the things that happen in Passion Week we have to all
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.960]   the more acknowledge how deep is this love of God that when we say a simple
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.000]   statement that God so loved the world that we sit there on the soul and
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.600]   realize that talks of depth and degree the extent of love and for us as
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.520]   children of God and one of the things that we really need to do is simply
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.040]   acknowledge and recognize that when we see the intricacies of how one would
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.800]   prepare how one would with God how one would pray how one would accomplish all
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.440]   these things on our behalf that we will recognize my God you truly love me beyond
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.520]   what I understand let's pray
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:50.480]   father God we we hear in your word that you love your disciples
