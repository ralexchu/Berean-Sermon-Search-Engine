[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   Here we are at session three.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.520]   That went by really fast, at least for me.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:36.000]   We looked at to whom do we pray, we talked about who God is, his power, his ability
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   to effect change.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.520]   We talked about the fact that he's our father and so he has the desire to effect change
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   for us.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:01:03.960]   And then this morning we looked at why we pray, the relationship that we have with God
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:30.080]   and how we pray, and how the Bible has so many wonderful examples for us of prayer,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.480]   whether it's in the Old Testament and the Psalms or looking at Jesus in the Garden of
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.080]   Gethsemane or the outline that he gave his disciples to use in their prayer.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.840]   And so now we come to session three which is does prayer have an effect?
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480]   Does prayer really change anything?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.960]   I think all of us have heard at one time or another the slogan "Prayer changes things."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.840]   See, you don't bump for stickers and signs.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600]   Is it biblical to think that prayer changes things?
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.680]   Is that what the Bible teaches?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.480]   Well James chapter 5 verse 16 says, "The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.840]   Yeah, the Bible teaches us that prayer does change things.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.240]   Our prayers have an impact and an effect.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   I want to look at a few examples.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.080]   I'm going to look at just a few and I have to admit at one point I had about twice as
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.360]   many notes and you should be very thankful that I cut it in half.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.760]   But it's so hard to choose which examples to use because the Old Testament is so full
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.920]   of examples of men crying out to God and God answering and God making change happen.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.960]   So the few we're going to look at, one is Moses.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.320]   In Exodus 32 he has led the people out of Egypt.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.520]   We talked about how God showed his mighty power in delivering the Israelites from Egypt
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   through his mighty axe.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160]   He's brought them through the Red Sea.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   He brings them out to the wilderness to Mount Sinai and he calls Moses up to the mountain
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   and Moses is gone for 40 days up on that mountain talking to God, receiving from God the covenant
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.880]   that he would have with his people.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.920]   And as Moses is coming back down the mountain, the people have not been idle.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.560]   They have taken their gold and their silver and they have melted it down and made a golden
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.600]   calf.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.320]   It's mind boggling when you really step back and think about this.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.180]   Here God took them out of hundreds of years of slavery in Egypt.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.080]   He showed his incredible power to them in the 12 plagues that he afflicted Egypt with.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.360]   He literally split the sea open and had them walk through on dry land.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.760]   And they come to the mountain of God and they see the thunder and the rumbling as we talked
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.520]   about it was such an awesome sight that the people said, "Moses, you go talk to God because
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.000]   if we do, we'll die."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.360]   And as they are seeing all of this, they're sitting at the bottom of the mountain hearing
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.800]   the thunder and the rumblings and they go, "You know what, maybe we need something we
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.560]   can see.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.920]   We can't see God."
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.200]   And so they make an idol, not out of wood, but out of gold.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.160]   And they're worshiping this idol and God becomes angry with the people.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.480]   And he tells Moses, "I'm going to destroy this people.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.440]   I'm going to destroy them and I'm going to make a nation out of you."
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.440]   You would think Moses, who's put up with some grumbling already about water, about food,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.320]   we're going to come out here and die.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.040]   What have you done to us, Moses?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.600]   You think he'd go?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   I agree.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.120]   These people, they really don't honor you.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   They aren't thankful.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.680]   All they ever do is complain.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   That's fine, God.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.760]   You go ahead and punish them and you can start over with me.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   That's not what Moses responds with.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:45.200]   And we see in Exodus 32, verse 11, that Moses pleaded with the Lord, his God, and said,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   "Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people whom you have brought out of the
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.240]   land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?"
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.200]   And then he talks to God and reasons with him about how the Egyptians would say, "Well,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.640]   God just brought them out to the wilderness to kill them.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.440]   God, he is."
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.520]   But in verse 14, it tells us, "So the Lord relented from the harm which he said he would
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.440]   do to his people."
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.520]   Moses cried out to God and God heard him and God relented.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.600]   Did Moses' prayer have an effect?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Absolutely.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.520]   The prayer of a righteous man or woman avails much.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.560]   Another example we have in the Old Testament is the prophet Elijah.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.880]   There were some pretty amazing things that God did through Elijah, but he was a prophet
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.760]   for Israel during a time where there weren't repentant kings like King David.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.600]   I'm sure Elijah wishes he lived in the time of the prophet Nathan where he would have
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.440]   a king that would respond in repentance.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   Instead, Elijah was a prophet of God during a time when the kings were very, very wicked
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.440]   and their queens were no better.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.680]   And we see here that Elijah has been dealing with Ahab and Jezebel.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   Even today, most of us know the name Jezebel.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.600]   Even if you're not a Christian, you've probably heard of, "Oh, that Jezebel.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.160]   Well that's talking about this queen.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.880]   She was that wicked."
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.960]   And so she hates Jehovah God.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.580]   She has done everything she can so that Israel will no longer worship Jehovah.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.540]   She has torn down places of worship.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.440]   She has killed every prophet she can find.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.960]   Elijah has eluded her.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:57.320]   And in James 5, verse 17 and 18, and this is in fact right before our verse in James
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.520]   5, verse 16 that talks about the prayer of a righteous man avails much.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.800]   This is right after that and they use Elijah as the example for the fact that our prayers
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   make a difference.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.280]   In verse 17, it says, "Elijah was a man with a nature like ours."
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.120]   How often do we kind of put Bible characters in a different class?
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   Somehow they were different kind of people?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   No.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Elijah was a man just as we are today.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Nothing extraordinary about him.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.680]   He served an extraordinary God.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.800]   And so it tells us that Elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed earnestly
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.520]   that it would not rain and it did not rain.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.960]   It did not rain on the land for three years and six months.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.380]   Verse 18 tells us, "And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth produced
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.520]   its fruit."
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:10.040]   Elijah prayed to God to close up the heavens and it did not rain on his country for three
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   and a half years.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.200]   Even in California we get more rain than that.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.360]   This was not a fluke of nature.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.200]   This was God choosing to listen to the prayer of Elijah and close up the heavens so that
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:35.240]   there was no rain for three and a half years until Elijah prayed again and asked God to
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.480]   set the rain.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.680]   Elijah was a man just like us.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.560]   It wasn't that he knew how to pray better or he knew all the magic words.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.280]   He was an ordinary man that served an extraordinary God.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:04.880]   A God who was powerful and a God who heard his prayers and answered them.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.520]   My next example is King Hezekiah.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:15.800]   King Hezekiah was a good king in the sense that he loved God and sought to serve him.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.760]   He wasn't always the smartest king and Israel suffered because of that at times.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   But it tells us that in those days Hezekiah was sick and near death.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.720]   And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, "Thus says the Lord,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.920]   set your house in order for you shall die and not live."
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.440]   This is not a message you want to hear from the prophet of God.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   In the Old Testament if a prophet gave a false message, he was stoned to death.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.120]   So you know that if the prophet of God comes to you and says, "Thus saith the Lord," he's
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.680]   pretty confident that that's what God has told him.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.720]   So this prophet Isaiah comes to King Hezekiah and says, "Yeah, you're sick.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   God says you're so sick that you're going to die.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:25.680]   So get your affairs in order because you are going to be facing your maker face to face."
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.920]   In verse 2 it says that Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to God saying,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:40.080]   "Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before you in truth and with a loyal
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.960]   heart and have done what was good in your sight."
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.600]   And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.240]   And it happened before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court that the word of the
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.200]   Lord came to him saying, "Return and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'Thus
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.080]   says the Lord, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.480]   I have seen your tears.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.440]   Surely I will heal you.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.360]   On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.'"
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.960]   I'm sure we all wish that all of our prayers were answered this quickly and with such a
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   positive response.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   Here's Hezekiah.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.800]   He's told by God, "You are sick and you're going to die.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   Set your affairs in order."
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.880]   What is Hezekiah's response?
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.320]   He turns his face to the Lord and he cries out to him.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.760]   He says, "God, please heal me."
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.880]   It says that before the prophet had even gotten to the middle court and unless Hezekiah had
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   a huge chalice, this was within a few minutes, God speaks to his prophet and says, "Go and
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.240]   tell Hezekiah I've heard him.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:02.440]   And three days from now, he is going to be fully recovered and walking into the courtroom
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.000]   to worship me."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.960]   God heard Hezekiah's request.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:15.400]   He saw his sorrow and his pain and he responded to his request and healed him.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.800]   So does prayer change things?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.160]   Absolutely.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.440]   Absolutely.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:27.600]   Again, these are only a very few examples that we see in the Old Testament.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.880]   Some of them are even more dramatic.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.840]   You have Joshua calling out to God and the sun stands still in the sky.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.600]   I don't even know how God did that.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.320]   He just kind of paused everything.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   But the sun stopped moving, which means the earth stopped moving.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.360]   God does amazing, miraculous things.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:56.280]   His prophets raised people from the dead.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.600]   The earth opened up and swallowed wicked men.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:09.160]   Our God is a God who is powerful and He hears our voices when we call out to Him and He
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.640]   responds to our cries.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   I want to look at the New Testament now.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.880]   Jesus is talking to His disciples about prayer and in John 14, He makes a pretty incredible
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.920]   statement.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:38.600]   In John 14, starting in verse 12, Jesus tells His disciples, "Most assuredly," so very,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.800]   very truly, this isn't a casual statement, this is a very serious statement that you
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:53.360]   can take, "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in me, the works that I do,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   he will do also."
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.680]   Let's just stop right there for a minute.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:08.000]   The works that Jesus did, if you believe in Him, you will do also.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.920]   "And greater works than these He will do because I go to my Father and whatever you
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:23.000]   ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.760]   If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.560]   If you love me, keep my commandments and I will pray the Father and He will give you
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.400]   another helper that He may abide with you forever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.440]   cannot receive because it neither sees Him nor knows Him, but you know Him, for He dwells
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.800]   with you and will be in you."
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   Jesus tells His disciples that anything you ask in my name, I will give to you.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.560]   Does this mean that any request we make will be given to us?
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.840]   It kind of starts to sound like a genie in a bottle, doesn't it?
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.360]   What about when we ask for those things that are not good and not helpful for us?
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:30.400]   In James chapter 4, starting in verse 1, we're told, and this is James speaking to the church
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   that is scattered abroad, he says, "Where do wars and fights come from among you?"
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   Now, let's stop right there for a minute.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.240]   Who is James talking to?
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.960]   He's talking to believers.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.080]   He says, "Why do you guys fight?
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.920]   Why is there conflict and friction when there should be unity in Christ?"
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.160]   He goes on, "Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.720]   You lust and do not have.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.840]   You murder and covet and cannot obtain.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.260]   You fight and war, yet you do not have because you do not ask.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:23.680]   You ask and do not receive because you ask amiss that you may spend it on your pleasures.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.960]   Believers and adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   God?
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:36.160]   Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.840]   What is James saying here?
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.320]   He says, "You guys are envious of each other and the things that you have.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.280]   I want what she has because you don't have because you don't ask.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.040]   But even when you ask, God doesn't give it to you because you're not asking out of a
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.880]   godly desire for the things of God.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.120]   You're wanting the pleasures of the world.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.480]   And God has called us out of that.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.680]   Friendship with the world is enmity against God.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.520]   Do you remember before you were saved?
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.060]   Remember that verse we looked at this morning where he said, "Such were some of you."
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:24.080]   We were in the world, we were rebelling against God as we were living for the desires of the
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   things here on earth.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.000]   We didn't desire any kind of relationship with God and he made us alive in him and changed
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.780]   our hearts, put a new heart within us so that now we're to desire the things of God.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.720]   He says, "You're not desiring the things of God.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.640]   You're still desiring the things of the world.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.180]   That's what you're going after.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:54.300]   And when you ask for those things, God says, "No, because that's not good for you."
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:01.700]   When Jesus is talking to his disciples, there's a really important phrase in that verse.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.940]   A lot of times we like to look just at whatever you ask, I will give you.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.740]   Well, we left out a little piece there, didn't we?
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.720]   It's a really important piece.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.820]   Whatever you ask in my name, I will give to you.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:23.140]   And this doesn't just mean that we close our prayers with, "In Jesus' name, amen."
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.500]   This goes a lot deeper than that.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:39.420]   When we're told that whatever we ask in Jesus' name we will receive, it means that our requests
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:46.140]   find their source in the character and the person of Jesus.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:54.240]   The things we're asking for are the things that will bring God glory.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.340]   In Psalm 37, verses 3 through 5, we're told, "Trust in the Lord and do good.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   Dwell in the land and feed on his faithfulness."
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:11.500]   Verse 4 says, "Delight yourself also in the Lord and he shall give you the desires of
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.900]   your heart."
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.460]   You hear this verse a lot.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.860]   Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.580]   If you want something, go delight yourself in the Lord and he's going to give it to you.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.860]   It's kind of missing the point.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:33.540]   It's not saying go to God and do a certain number of good works and that's going to earn
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.620]   you this petition that you're asking.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.620]   No.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.380]   This goes right back to what we talked about this morning, doesn't it?
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.980]   It says, "Delight yourself in the Lord."
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.260]   Not in his blessings.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.580]   Delight yourself in the person of your God.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.500]   As we sit and we meditate on who he is, as we are saturated with the truth of his character
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.300]   from the word of God, it changes our hearts.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:10.060]   Do you ever notice that those you spend the most time with, maybe a good friend.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:15.020]   I had a friend that was from the East Coast and she talked kind of different.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.260]   What was really scary is the more time I spent with her, the more I started to talk like
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.260]   her.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   It wasn't on purpose.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.260]   I didn't think about it.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.460]   No, I really like her accent.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.660]   I want to try and talk like that.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:31.460]   But because of the time that I spent with her, as we talked together, I just kind of
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:37.580]   absorbed parts of who she was and I started acting like her.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:43.220]   How much more does that happen to us with God because we're not just sitting and absorbing
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.460]   and spending time with him.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:54.180]   His spirit is within us and we're told that we are being conformed into the image of Christ.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.860]   We are being changed within.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:01.740]   And so as we sit and we delight ourselves in the Lord, he gives us the desires of our
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   heart.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.260]   But that doesn't just mean he grants our requests.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.180]   It means that the desires we have in our hearts as we sit and delight in God, those are the
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.900]   desires that God has.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.700]   Our heart becomes a reflection of his heart as we spend time delighting in him.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.740]   And so then when we pray, the prayers we are giving to God are things that he desires for
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:36.140]   us because we are absorbed in his presence and we delight in the things he delights.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.700]   And that changes the things that we desire in our lives.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:50.500]   So when we talk about asking in Jesus name, it's asking according to what Jesus would
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.500]   ask for.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.240]   There is a slogan, it's still around I know, but for a while it was super, super popular.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.180]   What would Jesus do?
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.500]   Sought everywhere.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.780]   What if we think of this as what would Jesus pray?
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.700]   Do you ever ask yourself that when you're praying?
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.380]   Would Jesus pray for this?
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.580]   What would Jesus pray for right now?
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.860]   When something happens, how would Jesus respond to that in prayer?
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.220]   That's essentially what this is saying.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:29.460]   Anything you ask in my name, we talk about being ambassadors for Christ.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.740]   We're told that we are ambassadors for Christ.
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.740]   What does that mean?
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.900]   Well, an ambassador is a representative of a country, right?
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.060]   So for us, that means being representatives of Christ.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:47.580]   In a sense, as we come before the Lord in our prayers, we say we are coming in the name
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.620]   of Jesus.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.020]   We are asking things that Jesus would ask.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:24:01.220]   And when we do that, we will receive our requests.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.420]   So if we're asking in Jesus name, we're delighting in the Lord.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.500]   He's giving us the desires of our heart.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.860]   Will there ever be a time that we make a request?
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:22.420]   And the answer is still no.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:29.140]   When we talked a little bit about Job this morning, and I'm kind of assuming you guys
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.420]   know a little bit about his story.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.860]   But at the very beginning of the book of Job, you have Satan coming into the throne room
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.780]   of God.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.060]   And God says to Job, he says, "Have you seen my servant Job?
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   He loves me."
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:56.980]   And Satan, and I am so loosely paraphrasing this, Satan says to God, "Well, you think
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.300]   he loves you, but really he just loves all the things you do for him.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.980]   Look at how you bless the guy.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:09.620]   He's rich, he's famous, he has all of these children, all of these lands.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:15.620]   If you took some of that stuff away, he wouldn't love you anymore."
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:22.380]   And God gives Satan permission to afflict Job.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.220]   It starts with his possessions.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.700]   Satan says, "If you took all his stuff away, he wouldn't love you anymore."
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:38.300]   God says, "Okay, I give you permission to take away the possessions of Job."
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:44.420]   And in one day, all of Job's possessions are gone.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:52.940]   Marauders come in, fires, it's a miraculous destruction.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:26:00.740]   This man was very, very rich, and everything he had was taken away.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.900]   And Job still praised God.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:11.580]   And so Satan goes, "Well, I bet if you took his family away, then he'd see you for who
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.580]   you are."
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:20.580]   And God says, "Okay, I give you permission to take his family."
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:27.980]   And in one single day, I think he had like 12 children.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:35.140]   All of Job's children die.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.860]   That's staggering.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:45.660]   I can't imagine losing one child, much less all three of my children, much less if I had
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.660]   12 children.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:57.300]   And in one single day, they're all gone, inexplicably, for no reason.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:04.980]   And still, Job trusts God.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.860]   At this point, Satan has to be getting pretty frustrated.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.500]   This is not going the way he planned.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.740]   But he's not ready to give up.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:21.860]   He goes to God and he says, "Okay, well, if you let me afflict Job, if you let him suffer
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:30.180]   physically, then I bet he'd turn on you."
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.540]   And God allows Satan to afflict Job.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:39.260]   He says, "You can't kill him, but you can afflict him."
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.820]   Job gets boils over his entire body.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.100]   He's in so much pain.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:55.180]   He's sitting in the dust, taking broken pottery and scraping his skin.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.340]   The only family member he has left is his wife.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.220]   And she tells him, "Job, just curse God and die."
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.260]   Not the most encouraging thing she could have said.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.980]   And there's part of me that thinks she was so horrified by the pain that Job was going
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.140]   through, she just wanted it to end for him.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.100]   Whatever she meant by it, can you imagine having your spouse tell you, "Just curse God
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.280]   and let it end."
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.580]   And Job is sitting there in the dust, and the only friends that come to him are those
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.500]   that are telling him, "Job, you must have done something wrong.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:40.100]   God must be punishing you for some terrible, horrible sin that you've done."
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.340]   And Job sits there and goes, "There's nothing.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.500]   I've walked faithfully before God.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.660]   I don't understand why he is letting this happen.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.660]   Can you imagine?"
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:00.820]   Job, as each of these things occurs, as his possessions are taken away, he goes, "I don't
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.580]   understand why.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.380]   God why didn't you protect me?
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.540]   But I trust you."
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:13.580]   His children die, and he cries out to God in pain and says, "God, why did you let this
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   happen?"
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.900]   And then he sits and he suffers.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:26.580]   And he cries out to God and says, "Why are you letting this happen?"
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.260]   And he receives no response.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.140]   As he sits here and he suffers, and then his friends come and tell him, "What is it you've
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.820]   done?
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.540]   Shame on you, Job."
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:52.980]   It isn't until Job starts to question the goodness of God and saying, "Why does God
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:30:00.580]   allow this?" that God comes and puts Job in his place.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:07.380]   And I think it's incredible because even at this point, God is not comforting Job.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:15.420]   He tells Job, "Who do you think you are to question Almighty God?"
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:26.420]   In chapters, I don't have it here, it's towards the end, I think it's like 38 and 39, God
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:31.420]   declares to Job his awesome power.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.700]   And he says to Job, "Where were you when I made the foundations of the world?
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.540]   Who are you to question my goodness?"
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:47.820]   And as we saw this morning, when God's finished with Job, Job says, "Even if you slay me,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820]   I will trust you.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.820]   I will trust you."
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:58.420]   At that point, God still hadn't done anything to change Job's circumstance.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.220]   And yet he chooses to trust God.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:09.380]   At the very end of the book, Job's suffering ends.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:16.300]   God blesses him, again gives him possessions, gives him many more children.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:22.380]   But there was a long time in that book, in the story of Job, where he called out and
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.380]   there was no answer.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:38.500]   And even in that, he chose to trust in the faithfulness of God.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:47.900]   We see another example where a godly, faithful man calls out in prayer and does not receive
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   his petition.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.900]   This one's in the New Testament.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900]   It's found in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.900]   It's in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:32:07.260]   And the Son of God is on his knees, tells us he was in such agony that he was sweating
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.940]   drops of blood.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:16.540]   The agony that the human body has to be under in order for blood to come out of your pores
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.540]   is incredible.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:25.060]   That is the agony that Jesus was in as he was in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:34.820]   And he cries out to his Father and he says in verse 35 that he fell on the ground and
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:40.180]   prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:46.620]   And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for you.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.140]   Take this cup away from me.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:57.380]   Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will."
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:04.460]   Apart from the physical suffering that Jesus went through on the cross, I think something
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:11.300]   that was far more on his heart in this moment was the fact that when all of our sin was
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:21.780]   put upon Jesus when he was hanging on the cross, he was separated from the Father.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:27.020]   He was separated from the Father.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:32.620]   Never ever had Jesus been separated from the Father.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:42.100]   The agony of that, that break in fellowship that we can so flippantly deal with sometimes
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.740]   caused Jesus such agony that even though he knew that the reason he came to earth was
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:54.980]   to die on the cross, when that hour came, that caused him such agony that he cried out
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:03.100]   and said, "Daddy, if there's any other way, take this away from me.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:09.500]   But I am going to submit to your will."
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.020]   And what was the Father's response?
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.580]   That cup did not pass from our Christ.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:26.020]   And that in itself is such an affirmation that as Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.420]   and the life."
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:34.820]   There is no other way that God could save mankind apart from the death of his Son.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:43.180]   If there was, this loving Father would have taken that cup from his Son.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:48.420]   Sometimes when God doesn't give us the answer we want, we think, "Maybe I didn't pray right.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.820]   Maybe I didn't earn God's blessing.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.060]   Maybe I just haven't been good enough."
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.980]   Let me tell you, you will never be good enough.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.300]   But Jesus was.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.980]   Jesus was perfect.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:12.260]   Not only did he never ever sin against the Father, he also always did everything that
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.940]   was right.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.020]   He never saw something and said, "Oh, I should really do something there, but I'm really
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.860]   tired."
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.060]   He always did what was right.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:31.180]   And here he is in more agony than probably any of us will ever endure, asking one thing
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:38.020]   of the Father, and the Father says, "No."
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:45.380]   There are times when God gives us a response we don't want, and he has a good reason for
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.180]   it.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.540]   We may get to see that reason down the line.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.460]   We may never know why he said no.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:36:00.700]   But we can trust and submit because we know to whom we pray.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:09.220]   It is our Father in heaven, the God of the universe, that when we cry it says he holds
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.260]   our tears in a bottle.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.020]   That's how precious your tears are to God.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.980]   He collects them.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.180]   There is never a moment that you're going through pain and you cry out to God and he
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.900]   goes, "I just don't have time right now."
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.140]   Or, "You know what, five minutes ago you really offended me."
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.500]   That's never how God responds to our prayers.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:37.620]   If we have cried out to him and he tells us no, he has a very good reason for it.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:44.060]   And it isn't even just his glory, it's also for our good.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:52.460]   God tells us that all things work together for the good of those who love him.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   Every single thing he allows in your life is for your good.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:05.140]   Every single thing that he denies you in your life is for your good.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.980]   You do not earn God's favor.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:14.740]   It has been freely given to you because of the work that Jesus did in the garden, on
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.140]   the cross.
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.380]   He earned our favor with God.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.500]   And when God hears our prayers, it is with that favor, it is in the name of Jesus that
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.100]   we enter the throne room.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:37.420]   And he views your petitions as if they are coming from his son Jesus.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:43.340]   Hebrews 5, verse 7 and 8 says that Jesus, who in the days of his flesh, when he had
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:49.620]   offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to him who was able
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:56.260]   to save him from death, was heard because of his godly fear, though he was a son, yet
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:10.020]   he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:16.580]   We will not always get the answer we want, but it will always be an answer that is given
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:27.100]   by a loving father who is never incapable of helping us or unwilling to help us.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:32.740]   So when he gives us, know it's for a very good reason.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:40.460]   So how do we respond when we don't get the response that we want from our prayers?
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:49.780]   We have to fall back to remembering who we're praying to.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:57.580]   Psalm 55, verse 17 says, "Evening and morning and noon will I pray and cry aloud and he
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.340]   shall hear my voice."
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:07.940]   Down in verse 22 he goes on, "Cast your burden on the Lord and he shall sustain you."
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:13.460]   He shall sustain you, whether he chooses to deliver you from the situation you're in or
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:18.940]   he chooses to have you go through it, he will sustain you.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.700]   He doesn't just say, "I'm sorry, you have to go through this."
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.780]   Even in the garden it tells us that angels came and ministered to Jesus and strengthened
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.820]   him.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.900]   God will sustain us in whatever he chooses to have us go through.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:41.380]   Isaiah 55, verse 9 says, "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.620]   higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts."
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.260]   This really reminds me again of our story in Job.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:55.900]   Who are we to question the mind of God?
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.900]   His thoughts, his ways are beyond our understanding.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:06.540]   And so understanding and trusting that even though I don't know what the goals of God
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:13.100]   in this situation are, I can still trust him.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:24.400]   C.H. Spurgeon said this and one of our sisters shared it with our women a couple years ago
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.580]   and it has just stuck in my mind and it's brought to my remembrance so often.
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:39.460]   He said, "Remember this, had any other condition been better for you than the one in which
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.580]   you are, divine love would have put you there."
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.980]   I'm going to read that again.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:55.740]   Had any other condition been better for you than the one in which you are, divine love
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.580]   would have put you there.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.340]   That means that if there were any situation that would be better for you, more for your
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:10.980]   good, more for your glory than where you are right now, God would have put you there.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:16.700]   Which means that wherever you are right now, whatever situation you find yourself in, good
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.660]   or bad, God puts you there for a purpose.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:28.340]   It is not an accident that you are where you are right now.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:36.420]   God's love placed you there.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:46.900]   Jude 1 verse 20 and 21 says, "Beloved, build yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:53.380]   in the Holy Spirit, keeping yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:58.380]   our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:02.220]   We need to keep ourselves in the love of God.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:10.460]   He never lets us go, but sometimes our mind and our heart is elsewhere, isn't it?
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.860]   Even though our position is secure, we're not living in it.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.660]   We're doubting the goodness of God.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.540]   We're looking to the things of the world to give us pleasure.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:32.100]   We need to keep ourselves in the love of God.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.380]   Remember how we talked about the foundation of our faith, that it isn't just enough to
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.380]   believe.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.980]   One, it needs to be something worthy of believing in, but it needs to be truth that we find
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.100]   in God's Word.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:48.260]   And so when we come to Him and we pray, understanding the truth of who God is and the fact that
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:56.580]   sometimes for our good He's going to say no, that's important for us to know and to remember.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:02.540]   Because if we do, then in those trials, in those times when things happen that aren't
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:10.380]   comfortable, that are painful, that we want to go away and God's not changing it, we're
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:17.740]   okay because we remember who God is and that He loves us.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.100]   Paul had a situation in his life and we don't know exactly what it was.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.940]   Some think it was a physical ailment.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:30.820]   Some think it was enemies that were getting in the way of him sharing the gospel.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:35.020]   But it was something that continued on and on and on and just was not going away.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:43.420]   And he tells us in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, starting in verse 8, Paul said that concerning
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.540]   this thing, this trial, this pain in his life, concerning this thing, I pleaded with the
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.900]   Lord three times that it might depart from me.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:44:00.180]   And He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.180]   weakness.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:07.220]   Therefore, most gladly, I will rather boast in my infirmities that the power of God may
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.700]   rest upon me.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:16.260]   Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions,
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:24.380]   in distresses for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:32.420]   Paul says, "I would rather go through difficult circumstances so that I can see God's strength
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:39.380]   working in me."
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:45.460]   He asked God over and over and over again to take it from him.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.780]   And God said, "No.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.100]   Lean on me for strength in the midst of this.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.380]   My strength is sufficient for you.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.140]   You don't need to be strong.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:07.940]   You need to rely on my strength in the midst of this."
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.100]   Paul knew who God was.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:20.620]   He accepted the fact that God's mind and God's purposes were different than his.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.660]   He trusted in the goodness of God.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.220]   And he said, "Okay.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:33.700]   I would rather continue to suffer so that God is glorified in me, that as I am weak,
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:40.420]   I see God's strength working through me."
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:48.180]   His perception of God was based in truth.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:54.100]   Timothy Keller said, "Your prayer must be firmly connected to and grounded in your reading
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.700]   of the Word.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:02.020]   This wedding of the Bible and prayer anchors your life down in the real God."
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:07.740]   Sometimes we lose sight of the real God and we start to make him in the image we want
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.980]   him to be.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:15.020]   It's important that we are anchored in truth.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.740]   Mr. Keller continues, "Without immersion in God's words, our prayers may not be merely
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:26.780]   limited and shallow, but also untethered from reality.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:34.700]   We may not be responding to the real God, but to what we wish God and life to be like."
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.320]   It's so important that we remember who our God is.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.780]   He is our loving Father.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:46.620]   He is all-powerful and able to accomplish his purposes.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:52.700]   And there are times that we have to accept that his purposes are not our purposes and
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:58.380]   to submit to his will as our Lord and King.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:06.420]   But even in that, Philippians 4 verse 6 tells us, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:14.500]   by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:22.900]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:28.500]   minds through Christ Jesus."
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:36.060]   When our understanding of God is tethered in the reality of his word, when we come to
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:44.820]   him with our petitions, with our supplications, we can do so with thanksgiving, and God's
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:52.620]   peace will guard our hearts from fear and anger and frustration because we are trusting
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.980]   in him.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:05.860]   David says in Psalm 62 verse 8, "Trust in him at all times.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.460]   Pour out your heart before him.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.340]   God is a refuge for us."
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.860]   This is not someone who had an easy life.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:22.260]   We've talked a little bit about it, but he had some very dark times as he was being wickedly
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.260]   pursued by his King.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:32.340]   He doesn't just say, "Trust in God sometimes."
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.860]   He says, "Trust in him at all times.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.900]   He is always a refuge for you.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   Even as he causes you to walk through a trial, he is still a refuge in the midst of that
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.860]   trial."
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.540]   We have to trust in who God is.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:59.380]   And that isn't just an intellectual assent.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.060]   It's something that we feel.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:10.460]   When we trust in God and his peace is ruling in our hearts, it changes the way we feel,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.460]   too.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.460]   E.M.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:21.260]   Bowne said it this way, "Trust is faith become absolute, ratified, consummated.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.740]   There is, when all is said and done, a sort of venture in faith and its exercise.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.100]   But trust is firm belief.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.820]   It is faith in full flower.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:39.300]   Trust is a conscious act, a fact of which we are sensible.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.420]   Trust like life is feeling, though much more than feeling.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:52.020]   An unfelt life is a contradiction, and an unfelt trust is a misnomer, a delusion, a
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.260]   contradiction.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.700]   Trust is the most felt of all attributes.
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:01.060]   It is in all feeling, and it works only by love.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:08.100]   An unfelt love is as impossible as an unfelt trust."
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.620]   If you say that you love someone, but there's no feeling of love in your heart, is it really
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.620]   love?
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.460]   He says, "The same is true with trust.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:25.100]   Trust is that peace and that rest, emotionally as well as intellectually, that we have as
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:34.260]   we recognize who God is, that he's worthy of our faith, and then we rest in him.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:42.420]   We trust in him because of who he is and what he has done."
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:53.340]   Even as we trust him, when it seems like our prayers aren't being answered, sometimes
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:51:00.020]   part of the reason that God lets us go through those things is to bring us to our knees,
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:08.580]   bring us to him because he wants to accomplish something, not in our circumstance, but in
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.660]   us.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:19.540]   Sometimes God lets us go through difficulty and pain to draw us near to himself.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:26.220]   Second Corinthians 4, verse 16 says, "Therefore we do not lose heart, even though our outward
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:32.300]   man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:39.660]   For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us far more exceeding
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.300]   an eternal weight of glory.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:47.700]   While we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen,
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:55.100]   for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:02.140]   Sometimes the work that God is doing is inside of us.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.180]   We're not to look to the things that are seen.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.780]   It's so much easier to look to the things that are seen because they're right in front
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.780]   of us.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:14.180]   But this life is a vapor.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.460]   That means it passes so fast.
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.500]   But after this life, we have our true life.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   We have eternity.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:28.940]   That is what we're to be looking toward.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:34.020]   So that even if in this life, and this light affliction that Paul's talking about is not
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.300]   what we would consider light affliction.
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.620]   He was stoned to death.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.220]   He was shipwrecked.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.740]   He was whipped and beaten.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:53.300]   He considers those light afflictions that are working for him a far more exceeding weight
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.060]   of glory.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.780]   Is that how we look at our difficulties?
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:06.740]   Do we see them as an opportunity for God to work in us?
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.420]   Whether it's through building our faith and our trust in him by seeing him work mightily
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   on our behalf, or whether it's teaching our hearts to trust, to rest, to wait patiently
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:27.100]   on him, to trust that in the midst of our difficulty, he is our loving father.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:33.380]   And if there were any better place for us to be, he would have put us there.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:40.780]   Do we trust in the love and the power of our father?
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.860]   So does prayer change things?
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.620]   Absolutely.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.980]   Our prayers do change things.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.180]   Sometimes it's going to be our circumstances.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:59.980]   As God responds to us as he did to Hezekiah and heals him, sometimes he's going to respond
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:10.620]   as he did to Jesus, where he strengthened him and sustained him through it.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:15.340]   But prayer always changes things.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:20.700]   First Peter 1, verses 6-9 says, "In this you greatly rejoice."
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.740]   So not a little bit of joy, but greatly rejoicing.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:32.220]   "Though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:37.260]   That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes,
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:44.340]   though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.580]   of Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, you love.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:55.220]   Though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:55:01.860]   of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   So whether God changes your circumstances or whether he uses your circumstances to change
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:17.020]   you, our prayers do change things.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:28.700]   So as we close, I just pray that we remember as we approach prayer that our Heavenly Father
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.300]   is powerful.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.140]   He is able to accomplish his purposes.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:45.460]   Wherever ever is he thwarted, that prayer is more than accessing the throne room when
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.980]   we need something.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.700]   So much richer than that.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:56:01.540]   It is our opportunity to spend time with our God, to explore the relationship that we have
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:07.900]   with him, to get to know him better, to delight in his presence.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:14.580]   And so important that when we pray, it's informed by the word of God.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.660]   Otherwise it's just words.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:25.900]   When we pray, it has to be from the truth of what God has shown us in his word.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:36.540]   And be so very confident that when you pray, it makes changes.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:41.500]   Prayer does change things.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.420]   The prayer of a righteous woman avails much.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:54.540]   There's a hymn, you don't hear it very often anymore, it's called "What a Friend We Have
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.700]   in Jesus."
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.180]   I want to go ahead and read it to you.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.100]   I'm definitely not going to sing it to you.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:03.140]   I'll do that to your lovely ladies.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.700]   I want you to think about what this says.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:12.180]   I am not familiar with Joseph Scriven, I can barely say his name.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:17.260]   But I can imagine what went on in his life that gave him the confidence to write these
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:25.460]   words and the regret of the times that he did not avail himself of prayer.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:32.020]   He says, "What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:36.500]   What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:45.180]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit, what needless pain we bear, all because we do not carry
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:48.300]   everything to God in prayer.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.780]   Have we trials or temptations?
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.740]   Is there trouble anywhere?
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:55.180]   We should never be discouraged.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.020]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:04.660]   Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.500]   Jesus knows our every weakness.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.300]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.140]   Are we weak and heavy laden?
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.500]   Humbered with a load of care?
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.620]   Precious Savior, still our refuge?
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.940]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.020]   Do thy friends despise, forsake you?
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.580]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.340]   In his arms he'll take and shield you.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.340]   You will find solace there."
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.860]   Let's pray.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:49.220]   Father, we thank you that we can come boldly into your throne room, that the welcome there
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:56.740]   will never change because it has been earned through the blood of Jesus.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:08.540]   Father, may we exercise that privilege of prayer so much more than we have before.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:13.900]   May we recognize more the richness of that privilege.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:18.220]   May we delight in your presence, Father.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:28.140]   And Lord, in those times where as our Father you say no, I ask that you would help us to
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:33.580]   rest and trust in you.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:38.460]   May we see our affliction as light and temporary.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:44.740]   Something that is working for us an eternal weight of glory.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   And may we never ever forget that whatever situation we're in, we are there because you
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.340]   placed us there.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.340]   Because you love us.
[00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:01.580]   And you have a purpose and you have a plan.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:06.580]   Help us to trust in that, Father.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:11.940]   I ask that you would continue to go before these women, Lord, as they spend their time
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:17.180]   in small group, as they go home again to the everyday.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:28.500]   May your words continue to dwell in their hearts, to affect their hearts and their lives.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:35.300]   Lord, we thank you that you prayed to the Father and that you have sent the Spirit into
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.900]   our hearts.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:42.180]   May we always cry out, "Abba, Father."
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.820]   We ask these things in the name of your Son, Jesus.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.540]   Amen.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:56.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
