[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Psalm chapter 90, verse 13 through 17.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.000]   We're going to do our third and final part in the series of look up, look in, and look
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   out.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.280]   Psalm chapter 90, verse 13 through 17, and I'm reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   Do return, O Lord, how long will it be?
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800]   And be sorry for your servants.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.720]   O satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may sing for joy and be
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.920]   glad all our days.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.480]   Make us glad according to the days you have afflicted us and the years we have seen evil.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.060]   Let your work appear to your servants and your majesty to their children.
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.240]   Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and confirm for us the work of our hands.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.760]   Dearest and loving Father, we've gathered here together because we want to hear from
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   you.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   We don't want man's voice.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760]   We don't want man's opinions.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.360]   We want your voice, Lord God, so that we may know what it means to follow you.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.000]   I pray that you would help us cut through all the distractions of our lives, that you
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.040]   would speak to us.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760]   Open our ears, open our hearts.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.400]   Help us have ears to hear.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.560]   May your word, Lord God, come to us in power with authority and clarity, that your church
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.440]   may be sanctified to grow, to be challenged, that we may live lives truly worthy of the
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   gospel that you've given us.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   Bless our time, Lord God, as we have come to bless you.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   Amen.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   All right.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.680]   Again, as you know, it's 2019 and we started a book of Psalms, or at least chapter 90,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.000]   because it was appropriate for Moses to be preparing to get into the promised land, to
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.360]   remind them in the beginning of the chapter that before the mountains were formed, God
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   was.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.920]   That ultimately, going into the promised land doesn't mean that that's where your home is.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   And he had to remind them so that they did not get distracted and again, fall into the
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.360]   same sin and same trap.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   So it's appropriate for us to take some time to think and consider, and I know some of
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   you guys have made New Year's resolution.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.360]   Some of you guys don't do resolutions anymore.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.840]   You kind of bah humbug about that because every year it seems to be a cycle and it's
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   like, well, we don't follow through anyway, so what's the point?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.080]   Whether you do it formally or informally, every single one of us thinks about what's
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   coming.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.360]   In 2019, some of you guys are going to have a baby and some of you guys are preparing
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   for that.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.720]   You're getting your rooms ready, baby showers, and your world is going to get rocked.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.040]   You're not going to sleep.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   Watching movies till late at night is going to be in the past, at least for a period.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   Traveling, forget it.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   So some of you, you're going to have children come into your life, a baby come into your
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.360]   life and your world is going to change and you're preparing for that.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.560]   Some of you guys are in the midst of getting ready for a wedding.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.600]   And so all that comes along with that.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.360]   The two people sharing apartment lives and all this stuff, that's going to come.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.720]   Some of you guys are on the verge of graduation and you can almost taste it.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.280]   You worked so hard for the last three and a half years, now you're taking 36 units because
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.960]   you got to make up for all the things you did and then now you're trying to get out.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.920]   Some of you guys just got a job and maybe your first paycheck is coming.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   And so to you, that means freedom.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   So every single one of us has something, maybe two different degrees that we're looking forward
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.360]   to possibly in 2019.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.080]   Ultimately, what is our longing?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.160]   I mean, there's a lot of little things that kind of you put together and it makes us do
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.240]   things that make plans and invest and sacrifice and work hard.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.800]   But ultimately, the overarching passion in you, what does that have to do with the things
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.200]   of God?
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.160]   See the Jews at the time of Christ and prior to that, constantly reminded each other by
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.640]   the very way that they greeted each other, shalom.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.540]   And shalom basically means God's blessing upon you or peace be upon you.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.440]   So even in their very greeting, they reminded each other that ultimately, your life is good
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.640]   or bad based upon God's blessing upon your life.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   So they would say shalom.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.920]   We come to the New Testament and on top of the shalom, peace, the Christians added grace.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.080]   So if you look at a good chunk of the letters in the New Testament, it starts out by the
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.160]   author saying grace and peace to you.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.720]   That this peace that the Jews were seeking and desiring from God, ultimately was going
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.000]   to come to them by the grace of God.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.840]   Moses is preparing the nation of Israel to enter into this new stage of their life.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.000]   Forty years they were wandering in the desert because of their sin.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   And he reminds them at the beginning of the chapter that the physical land is not your
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640]   home.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   God is your refuge.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.940]   He's the one who has control over your destiny.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.400]   And then the second part, last week we talked about how he says in light of who he is, you
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.280]   have to remember who you are.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   That our iniquities are deeply embedded in us.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.000]   And what we experience in life is because of the fall.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.360]   You know, we try so hard thinking like if we get enough counseling, if we study hard,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.400]   we make the right decision, make the right investments, that our life is going to get
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   better.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.720]   But the overarching experience of mankind is under the umbrella of this sin.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.220]   And no amount of hard work can pay that off.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.000]   And that's what Moses was reminding them, that your experience out in the desert and
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.360]   the reason why every Israelite who entered into the desert died, except with the exception
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.640]   of three, was because of their sin.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:21.000]   So if you believe what Moses said up to this point, what is the natural reaction or response
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.340]   of the believers?
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.640]   What is your response?
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.220]   What should our response be if we truly believe that God is our refuge?
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.720]   That all mankind is under this judgment of God and everything that we experience, hardship,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.480]   labor, toiling, and then eventually death, is because of this sin, our natural response
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.220]   should be to cry out to God for his mercy.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.920]   That should be the natural response of every sinner who believes what Moses says and what
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.020]   the Bible says.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.940]   And so the third part that we're looking at, verse 13 to 17, Moses is actually crying out
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.680]   for revival to happen in Israel.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.640]   And ultimately, obviously, as we are studying it, in God's people.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.000]   So the three things that we want to look at, the three parts of the prayer that Moses offers
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.540]   up to God, first part of it, we find in verse 13, where he is basically praying for revival,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.480]   for the Lord to return.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.160]   He says in verse 13, "Return, O Lord, how long will it be?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   And be sorry for your servants."
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.320]   There's a longing in Moses and he knows and he recognizes and he wants the nation of Israel
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.000]   to recognize that you may enter the promised land, but if the Lord does not return, you
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.380]   may have better food, you may have fortified cities, but in the end, you are no different
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.420]   than when you are wandering out in the desert.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.160]   Until the Lord returns.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Unless the Lord builds his house, we build it in vain.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:02.360]   That's why for every Christian, every Christian, if you are a Christian, God has placed in
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.580]   us a longing and a desire to reconnect with the Father.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.520]   It is that desire to reconnect with the Father that causes us to come to church.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.400]   It is that desire to reconnect with the Father that causes us to study the Word of God, to
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.720]   love people, to evangelize, to go to India, to China, to Japan, wherever it is that God
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   sends us.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   It is that desire to reconnect with God and connect other sinners to God.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:35.960]   So when Moses is asking for the Lord to return, how long will it be?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.020]   First and foremost, there's a recognition that they have drifted from God.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.400]   That they experience what they experienced in the desert because they sinned against
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   God.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.440]   So in other words, it is a recognition of what they have done before God.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.320]   For any sinner to have any kind of relationship with this Holy God, it begins by recognizing
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.480]   our own transgression.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.840]   Look at David in Psalm 51, 3-4.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.560]   He says, "For I know my transgressions."
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.800]   When he says he knows his transgressions, he's not simply saying, "I understand this.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.160]   Somebody told me, and so now I can articulate what I've done."
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.900]   When he says, "I know my transgressions," he is saying that it is deep within him.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.620]   He knows it intimately and personally.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.080]   My sin is ever before me.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:31.820]   Again, remember Moses was a man handpicked by God to lead the nation of Israel.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.220]   He said, "This is a man after my own heart."
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.660]   Among all the nation of Israel, that's the guy, he says, above all the other people in
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.860]   the nation of Israel.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:49.100]   And yet David, his experience as a king, he says, "If anything, it only exposed my
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   transgression.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.620]   My sin is before me all times.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.440]   Against you and only you have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that you
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.200]   are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge."
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.220]   Even the way that we repent sometimes.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.540]   We say, "Of course, we're not dumb.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.420]   We're not going to come before God and say, 'I'm not a sinner.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.420]   I've done nothing wrong.'"
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.300]   I rarely meet anybody, Christian or non-Christian, who justifies their righteousness.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.700]   "I'm not a sinner.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.700]   I'm not selfish.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700]   I don't slander.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.860]   I don't steal."
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.180]   Really rarely somebody is that deceived.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.620]   But typically, even in the way that we confess our sins, we say, "I've sinned, but it's
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   not as bad as those guys."
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.140]   Now, I did what I did because look at the way they treated me.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.900]   I did what I did because I didn't have this growing up.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.460]   I do what I do because you don't know my parents and what they've done or my brothers or what's
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.020]   happened to me in the past.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:11:00.260]   The first step in reconciling with this holy God is owning up to who we are.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.540]   I know my transgression.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.540]   It is ever before me.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.740]   And again, in Psalm 32, 3 to 5, if you're not a believer, I'm going to read this passage
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.720]   and you're going to say, "Oh, it's interesting."
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.220]   But if the Holy Spirit is in you, the way that David describes where he is before he
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.880]   was forgiven of his sins, I think every single one of us would be able to relate.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.180]   He says, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.580]   Through my groaning all day long, for day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.580]   My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer."
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:47.420]   Do you understand or can you relate the way that David describes his condition of guilt
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.140]   when he kind of tried to justify it and hide it from other people?
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.900]   He said it was wasting away.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:12:00.780]   My bones were being wasted away and my body was groaning all day long.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:07.540]   The Holy Spirit in us will never make us feel comfortable in our sins.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.820]   And if you are a Christian and the Holy Spirit is dwelling in you, you know exactly how this
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.260]   feels when you compromise.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.820]   No matter how much you try to justify it, your bones, you feel like the weight of God
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.100]   is upon you.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:27.980]   And for whatever the reason in our generation, we think it is wrong to make people feel guilty.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.340]   We want to be encouraging.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.580]   We want to be uplifting.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.620]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.940]   But without the pressure of guilt, where is repentance?
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.660]   Because repentance comes after guilt.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:50.300]   But when you take the guilt out and you go from sin to rejoicing without repentance,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.420]   there's no true repentance.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.260]   There's no true forgiveness.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.420]   It means nothing.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.020]   It's just words that we say.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:05.920]   It's kind of like if you were to write a love letter, you know, and you really have nothing
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.460]   to say, so you Google it and you take a piece of letter that somebody else wrote and you
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.300]   cut and paste and you put it into a letter, right?
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.100]   And then you give it to that person to appease your wife.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.300]   And it means nothing because they're not your words.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.660]   You didn't put any thought into it.
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.560]   It doesn't represent your emotions.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.220]   You just cut and pasted it because your wife is going to get angry if you don't give it
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.500]   to her, so I did it.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:37.060]   And then she looks it up, types it in, and she sees it's all over the internet.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.380]   And even it has even less meaning because now for sure, this meant absolutely nothing
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.380]   to you.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:48.420]   It was just the regurgitation of some words that somebody else wrote.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.140]   Because until it strikes us and we recognize where we stand before God means absolutely
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.540]   nothing.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.140]   Until we're able to come to the point, it says, "When I didn't repent, my bones were
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.140]   wasted away."
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.580]   See, that's the state of a Christian who is in rebellion against God, who is living in
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:10.700]   compromise, who is constantly living in lukewarmness, and the pressure of God is upon that person
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.020]   to bring them to repentance.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.340]   Verse 5, "I acknowledge my sin to you and my iniquity I did not hide.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:24.220]   I said I would confess my transgressions to the Lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin."
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.660]   That's what he means when he says, "Return to us, O Lord."
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.100]   How long?
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.860]   In and of itself, he is confessing that they have drifted away from God.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.140]   Before revival can come, God always brings us to repentance.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.820]   All of a sudden, we become more aware of the compromises in our lives.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.620]   All of a sudden, when the Holy Spirit begins to work in our lives, even the very things
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.500]   that we've justified in our lives, all of a sudden seems detestable in God's sight.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.940]   And God brings us to repentance.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.180]   That's why he's saying, "Return to us, O Lord."
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.340]   In other words, we will return to you, Lord.
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.860]   But what does it mean in that second part, "And be sorry for your servants"?
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.980]   Why would God be sorry?
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.580]   That word for sorry in other places literally means to repent.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:21.740]   I mean, the audacity of Moses to come before God and say, "Lord, repent.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   Repent over your servants."
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.180]   Obviously, God does not repent like you and I repent.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.700]   In Numbers 23, 19, God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.220]   repent.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.460]   God doesn't repent like we repent.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.780]   We did something wrong, and we need to rectify it, and so God changes his mind.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.100]   That's not the repentance he's talking about.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.540]   In ESV, that word is translated to pity.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.660]   "Lord, pity.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.740]   Pity your servants."
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.940]   Or the NIV says, "Lord, have compassion."
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:59.860]   It's talking about a deep-seated emotion when he sees the state of mankind.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:07.740]   When Jesus stood before Lazarus' tomb after his death, it says that Jesus wept, even though
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.540]   he deliberately went there late and waited until he died, even though he told his disciple
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.180]   that he was going to raise him up, that it wasn't going to end in death, but in God's
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.180]   glory.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.180]   So he knew all of that.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.620]   He planned all of that, and yet he was standing before the death of Lazarus, and the Scripture
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.380]   says that he wept.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:36.900]   What it means in that passage was he saw the state of mankind, and he had compassion, because
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.900]   death was the most tangible evidence of the judgment of God upon mankind, because he told
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.480]   Adam and Eve, "When you sin, you shall surely die."
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.460]   And as he stood before Lazarus' tomb, as he saw Jerusalem riding upon the donkey coming
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.060]   in, knowing that judgment was going to come upon them, it also says in that passage that
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.180]   Jesus wept.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:08.020]   So when here he says Moses is telling God, "Be sorry or repent," he's saying, "Lord,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.620]   have compassion on us."
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:19.660]   God is not indifferent toward our suffering, and God is not indifferent toward our weaknesses.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:25.020]   For revival to come, first and foremost, you and I need to recognize where we stand before
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.140]   God.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:36.500]   And that's, again, and that's the danger of being rich, because we don't see the consequence
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.020]   of our sins.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   We see the consequence of making bad decisions.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.700]   We see the consequence of not being a good businessman.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.700]   We see a consequence of not communicating well and being sensitive to your wife.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.740]   And so we try to fix all of that.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:58.220]   But when it comes to our sin, we don't recognize what that does to God, what that does to us
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   when we are spiritually insensitive.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:08.500]   Before revival comes, there's always a greater awareness of who God is.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.940]   There's always a greater awareness of who we are, which is the catalyst that causes
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.500]   us to come to him and want him.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.540]   Until we recognize the greatest need that every single person in this room brought into
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:29.900]   this room, wasn't a better job, better circumstance, better friends, better communication, better
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.180]   ingenuity.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:38.340]   Until every single sinner recognizes that our greatest need in 2019 is to reconnect
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.620]   with this holy God.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.020]   You will live your life in vain.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.460]   You will do your business in vain.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.940]   You will work on your marriage in vain.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.840]   You will raise your children in vain.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.920]   You will travel in vain.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.340]   You will make money in vain.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:57.220]   You will enjoy yourself and live in vain in 2019 until we recognize this is our greatest
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.260]   need.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:07.140]   Secondly, his prayer is a prayer for God to satisfy their longing.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:14.140]   Oh, satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness that we may sing for joy and be glad
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.260]   in all our days.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:22.420]   To be satisfied, there's a prerequisite that there is a longing.
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.460]   God can come and bring revival, but if there is no desire, you won't even recognize when
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.740]   revival comes because there was no desire in you.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.060]   The fact that you and I have that desire in and of itself is a blessing.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:42.100]   The fact that God opened your ears and desire to hear the word of God is because God's been
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.700]   gracious to us.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:51.620]   In Matthew 5, 6, Jesus is talking about the kingdom of God and he talks about the beatitudes
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:59.260]   and every one of those beatitudes is a completely paradigm shifting, paradigm shifting way to
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.260]   look at the world.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.940]   And right in the smack in the middle of that in Matthew 5, 6, it says, "Blessed are those
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:11.260]   who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:19.780]   You and I typically think we made some good investments and the stock went up skyrocketed.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.300]   God is so good.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.940]   You moved your jobs before your company went down and now you got promoted and so you're
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.140]   making more money.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.820]   God is so good.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.740]   You made some decisions and the puzzles pieced together.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.620]   You made some relationship and all these things went well and you're healthy and you're strong.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:46.220]   And we typically say God blessed us because we are no longer hungry and we are no longer
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.100]   thirsty.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:57.300]   But Jesus said of the kingdom, "He who hungers and thirsts, they are the ones who are blessed
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.420]   because satisfaction is coming for them."
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:08.460]   But when we are already satisfied, we are no longer longing for him.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.100]   He says in the kingdom of God, you are not blessed because even when Christ comes, you
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.500]   will not recognize what he brings.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.500]   He says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for those who are
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:26.980]   not satisfied, who are living day to day, knowing that satisfaction is not here."
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.580]   And that's why Jesus constantly told them, "I am the bread of life."
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.360]   If you continue to be satisfied with the bread that this world gives you, what happens the
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.140]   next day?
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.260]   You get hungry.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.500]   What happens the day after that?
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.180]   No matter how much you've eaten today, tomorrow you'll be hungry.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.620]   Again we look at the world and we look at these people who are living in poverty and
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.180]   say, "Poor them.
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.060]   We are blessed so we need to give to them."
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.180]   Now every Christian should be generous.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.020]   Every Christian should not look upon the suffering of the world and be indifferent toward their
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.260]   suffering.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.060]   But think about the perspective from God.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.300]   He said it's not those who are going hungry.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.780]   It's not those who are going thirsty because they don't have access to clean water.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.940]   He said, "Blessed are those who recognizes that there is a longing inside of them that
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.980]   can only be satisfied in Christ.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.680]   Blessed are they, for they shall be satisfied in Christ."
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:38.400]   So when Moses says, "Oh, satisfy us in the morning," that prayer in and of itself is
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.840]   a blessing from God.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:51.280]   To realize that my pursuit, my greatest pursuit in 2019 is to be nearer to Him.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   A Christian who has lost his way is no different than a child, a three-year-old child who loses
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   his mom at Disneyland.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   And I use Disneyland on purpose.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.120]   I mean, it's fantasy land for children.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:15.760]   I remember when I was a kid, going to Disneyland was a big, big deal.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.560]   You go to Disneyland and you get to ride the world.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.800]   It's a fantasy world and the food tastes better over there.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.080]   Soda tastes better over there.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.720]   Everything's better, especially when you're a kid.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.840]   But in the midst of Disneyland, if you lose your mom, until you reconnect with your mom,
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   you can't enjoy the ride.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.400]   You're not going to say, "Oh, I can't see my mom.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   I'm going to ride for a while for the next eight hours and I'll look for her later."
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   You can't eat your food.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   You can't rest.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.080]   You can't enjoy yourself until you reconnect with your mom.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:57.480]   See, a Christian who has lost his way, no matter what blessing that God has given us,
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.160]   until we are restored and are satisfied in Christ, is no different than a small child
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.480]   who is in the presence of all this blessing, but none of it can be enjoyed because we've
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.040]   been separated from the author of life.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.160]   That's what he means when he says, "Oh, satisfy us in the morning."
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.640]   He doesn't say, "Oh, give us bread in the morning.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.160]   Oh, give us clean water in the morning.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.480]   Oh, give us warm house in the morning."
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.640]   He says, "Oh, satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may sing joy,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.480]   sing for joy and be glad all of our days."
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.240]   In Psalm 63, 1-4, it says, "Oh God, you are my God.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.840]   I shall seek you earnestly.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.160]   My soul thirsts for you.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.360]   My flesh yearns for you."
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.140]   The psalmist isn't describing just a casual desire to know God.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.480]   God is not somebody that you can approach and say, "You know what?
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.820]   I got nothing to do today.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.560]   I've watched all the Netflix movies and I've done everything, so I got a chunk of time
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.480]   today between five and seven and maybe I'll just kind of put in my quiet time and do my
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.060]   little thing over here."
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.360]   God made it very clear.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:19.980]   "You shall seek me and find me when you search me with all your heart."
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.940]   God is God.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.120]   You wouldn't go into your CEO's office like that.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.480]   You don't come back after lunch and say, "You know, I got a 10-minute break.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.960]   I'm just going to hang out with my CEO.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.440]   I'm just going to walk in there."
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   And he's like, "What are you doing here?"
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.240]   He's like, "I was bored.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.240]   I liked your sofa.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   I haven't talked to you in a while.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   What are you doing?
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   What are you up to?
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.080]   You're fired."
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.200]   You don't go into the CEO's office like that.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.240]   He's just another human being.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.480]   Our nonchalant attitude in the way that we pursue Christ may be the very reason why he
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.000]   feels so distant.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.520]   Because we filled our time with all these other things, and then God has become the
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.740]   last thing that we do.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.800]   And then we wonder when, when we give that part of him, why I don't get anything out
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.980]   of quiet time?
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.080]   Why it's so hard for me to pray?
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.900]   Why fellowship is so difficult?
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.080]   The psalmist says, "I shall seek you earnestly.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.360]   My soul thirsts for you.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.480]   My flesh yearns for you."
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:28.800]   When was the last time you had that kind of passionate desire to meet with the Lord?
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.440]   Maybe the last time you had that kind of passion was right before you went on your first date.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.120]   Cleaned up your shoes, made sure your teeth, like there's nothing green, no kimchi in between
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.800]   your teeth.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.720]   Combed your hair perfectly, got a new shirt.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.080]   Because you were so passionate of getting this right.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.640]   Maybe that's the first time you saw your car coming as a teenager.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   It meant freedom.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.760]   It could have been a piece of junk, it didn't matter.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   Meant freedom to you.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   Washed it, right?
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.200]   How can I better it?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.040]   When was the last time that you had that kind of passion for the thing that matters the
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.160]   most to us?
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.120]   We put so much time and energy on trivial things that in the end matter, it doesn't
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.320]   matter at all, like zero.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.640]   Other than give you a little bit of endorphin for that short period of time.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.720]   And again, it's not sinful, but when you consider how much time and effort and energy and money
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.640]   goes into pursuing trivial things in light of pursuing the eternal God, the author of
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:44.280]   life, is it no wonder we feel spiritually dry and distant?
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:51.200]   It's not because God is hiding, he's waiting for us to make up our mind.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.320]   Stop teeter-tottering between judgment.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.080]   Will you worship Baal or will you worship God?
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.360]   For me and my house, we will worship the Lord.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.200]   That was a frustration with Joshua.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   It wasn't because they were outright rejecting God, but they were playing games.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.320]   When it was convenient to worship God, they worshiped God.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.300]   When it was not convenient to worship God, they worshiped Baal and they were teeter-tottering
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.720]   between two judgments.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.920]   I want the world and God at the same time.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.120]   And Joshua says, make up your mind.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.600]   Until you and I make up our mind that this is what we want more than anything else, revival
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.960]   will not come.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   Psalm 42, this is my favorite hymn.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:42.600]   As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for you.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.960]   When was the last time you sang this song?
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.840]   And it was an expression of your heart.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.320]   That this was your prayer, not words that you're saying, not words that you're reciting.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.440]   As a deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for you.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.320]   Oh God, my soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.200]   When shall I come and appear before God?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.160]   Are you not here?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:16.440]   Because at some point in your life, he satisfied your thirsting.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.780]   Didn't you come, decide to come to church?
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:25.400]   Because at some point in your life, he satisfied your hungering.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:32.220]   At what point from that point until now, did it no longer become satisfying?
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:38.440]   At what point in your walk with God, that the living water in Christ would no longer
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.040]   quench your thirst?
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.600]   Is it just some testimony of the past when you started and the rest of your life, you're
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.800]   going to nibble at the table of the world?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:59.700]   Revival will not come until the hungering and thirsting for righteousness for him, supersedes
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.640]   any other hungering in our life.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.400]   That has to be our greatest pursuit in 2019.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:18.520]   If there's anything else competing without desire for God, you are deeply rooted in worldliness
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:25.160]   and you may not even know it because the temptation is so great.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.320]   Look at where you and I live.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.720]   Every time I travel around the world, no matter where we were, even when I go to rich countries,
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.120]   I never leave that country thinking, "I want to live here."
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   Never.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   Maybe some of you may feel different, but I never.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.760]   Japan, Hong Kong, some nicest place in the world, it's a great place to visit, never
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.080]   want to live there because we have everything here.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.440]   We're 10 minute drive to the beach, an hour if you want to go see snow.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.960]   You can go down to Mexico in an hour and get some great Mexican food.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   All the best foods in the world that happen to be here because they're all here.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.840]   Look at this weather.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.960]   This is middle of winter, some of you guys are wearing shorts.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.400]   If we took pictures and send this around the world, they'd go, "These people are crazy."
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.440]   We have a great university here.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.880]   We live in one of the safest places in the world.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.640]   The job market is great.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.600]   Even if the world is having a hard time, that's not us.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.680]   Even if we're struggling financially, we can't even ever open our mouths when we travel,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:43.120]   considering the fact that we're even over there makes us rich.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:50.160]   How can we possibly compete with all of this?
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.400]   How can any human being just say, "I'm just going to turn it off.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.800]   I'm not going to love it anymore.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.720]   I'm just that strong willpower.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   No more.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.200]   I'm just going to turn it off.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.960]   That's just how I am."
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.320]   You can't turn it off.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:18.440]   The temptation is tremendous, especially for me and you.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:26.880]   What do you and I have that can possibly make all of that look like rubbish?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.740]   Your friends, leadership, organization, your house.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:39.960]   What can possibly compete with a temptation that is around us 24/7?
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.200]   You already know the answer to that.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.360]   Christ and Christ alone.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:57.160]   He's the only thing that in light of all of that temptation, it looks like trash.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.680]   And so the only way that we can possibly persevere and make it out of this is if we continue
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:08.840]   to fix our eyes on the majesty and beauty of Christ.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.600]   That's why Moses is saying, "Oh, satisfy us in the morning," because the temptation in
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.760]   the promised land is great.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   There's a lot of milk.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.800]   There's a lot of honey in that area.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.040]   There's a lot of promises of ball worship.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.080]   There's a lot of things that all the other nations have that they have.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.200]   What is going to prevent us from going into that promised land and forgetting about God
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.280]   and becoming like all the other nations until you satisfy us in the morning with your loving
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   kindness?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.400]   There is no hope.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.960]   Again, when our hungering for God is stronger than any other desires in us, then revival
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.880]   is not far.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:34:01.000]   Third and finally, prayer for revival is God's work to be seen in man.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.560]   Prayer for revival is for God to tangibly reveal himself in his work.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.200]   Let me read the previous verse before we read verse 16, verse 17.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.720]   It says, "Make us glad according to the days that you have afflicted us," oh, sorry, in
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:22.040]   verse 14, "Satisfy us in the morning, your loving kindness, that we may sing for joy
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.840]   and be glad all our days."
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.840]   You know that word for loving kindness in Hebrew is a very important word because it
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.760]   is the Old Testament Hebrew equivalent of agape.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.400]   It is a covenant love.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.880]   It is not just kind of casual love where God chooses to love one day and not choose to
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.120]   love the next day, just like agape.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.600]   Agape is God willfully loving sinners.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:52.400]   So the word in Hebrew, kesed, that is translated here for loving kindness, he says, "We are
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:35:02.560]   not consumed because of his covenant love for us, otherwise we would be smashed."
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.320]   In Jeremiah 9, 24, it says, "But let him who boasts of this, that he understands and knows
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.200]   me and I am the Lord who exercise loving kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for I
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.360]   delight in these things, declares the Lord."
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   It is his nature.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.640]   It is because he chose to love us, why you and I are still here.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.900]   It is a covenant love.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:34.020]   Let me tell you the distinction between a covenant love and just any other kind of love.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.580]   When you are dating, your relationship is fragile.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.580]   It is fragile.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.580]   It does not matter.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.580]   It is like, "Well, not us."
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.580]   It is like, "Yes, you."
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:50.220]   It is very fragile because it is not founded upon covenant love.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.560]   While you are dating, I love you because you love me.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.860]   I like you because you like me.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.020]   And so there are standards for that, right?
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:05.620]   But it is very shallow because there is nothing beyond your emotions that keeps you together.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.500]   I will give you a perfect example.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.860]   When I was younger, there was a guy that we knew.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:19.140]   He started dating this girl and he wanted to break up with her because they went swimming
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.580]   together and he did not like the way she looked when she was wet.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.820]   That is serious, true story.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.540]   He saw a picture of her with her hair wet and she just did not look attractive.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.780]   When her hair was wet, she did an awesome job with the blow dryer, but when it did not
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.380]   work, she was just not the same girl.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:45.180]   And even our friends were like, "You are an idiot.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.340]   How can you possibly break up with her because you did not like the way she looked in her
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.340]   hair?"
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.700]   And he said, "He just could not get over it."
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   He ended up breaking up with her.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.700]   Idiote.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:03.140]   That is the only thing we can think of.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:08.780]   But what binds him to her?
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.960]   We were saying like, "You know what?
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.780]   You should break up with her because she deserves better than you.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.620]   She should not be with somebody that is going to break up with her because you did not like
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.100]   the way that her hair looked when she jumped into the pool.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.100]   Tell me, get out of here."
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   Right?
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.340]   Even though we are good friends.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.940]   But during that period of dating, it is that shallow.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.860]   I am not saying, I am sure none of you would ever do that, but it is that shallow because
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   what binds you?
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.780]   He was saying like, "Well, what do I do?
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.860]   I cannot help how I feel.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:47.980]   I am just no longer attracted to her because of her wet hair."
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:53.820]   The distinction between a dating relationship versus a married relationship is married relationships
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.740]   is bound together by covenant.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.540]   And this covenant is not something that you and I are supposed to break.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.260]   And you think that two people got together who are dating, who had all these superficial
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.460]   attractions to each other, all of a sudden they became supernaturally, it just all disappeared
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.820]   and everybody became mature as soon as you became married?
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.820]   No.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.940]   It is the same two human beings.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:26.100]   Same fickleness, same selfishness, who was in the marriage relationship as they were
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.660]   in a dating relationship.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.620]   But the difference between the married relationship is there is a covenant love that binds them
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:41.300]   together, which causes them to persevere through these idiotic things.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.380]   Our relationship with God is based upon His covenant, unilateral covenant He made with
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.020]   us.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.020]   He didn't just love us.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:54.420]   He said He demonstrated His love while we were yet sinners, while we were as unattractive
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.360]   as we could be, as our hair is as wet as it could be.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.040]   He said He chose to love us.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.780]   That is His covenant love toward us.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:14.220]   When you and I understand that that's who He is, why would anybody who believes that
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.940]   want anything else but that?
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.980]   That's what Moses is saying.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.580]   Satisfy us, Lord.
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:29.020]   It's not the bread, it's not the water, but You.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.560]   You come.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.860]   And then again, He ends, "Let Your work appear to Your servants, Your majesty to their children."
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:41.980]   In other words, now that we're going into the Promised Land, help us to tangibly see
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   who You are.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.460]   Help us to see Your glory.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.940]   In Habakkuk 3, 2, it says, "Lord, I have heard the report about You, and I fear, O
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   Lord.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.260]   Revive Your work in the midst of the years.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.820]   In the midst of the years, make it known.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.980]   In wrath, remember mercy.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.860]   Lord, show Your work to us, in Your majesty, even to their children."
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:06.820]   So remember, when Moses was called to lead the nation of Israel, Moses' first response
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.440]   was, "No, no, no, not me."
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.620]   And God didn't say, "Oh, my humble child."
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.300]   God says, "No, you're an arrogant fool.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.900]   I didn't call you because I needed you.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.140]   I created your mouth.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.100]   All you need to do is open when I tell you to open and shut it when I tell you to shut
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.460]   it.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.820]   I'm just using you as a tool."
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.180]   He said, "Oh, okay, I repent."
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.540]   And then he goes on, and then he goes in, and Moses didn't volunteer for this, but by
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:36.900]   the time he's entering into the desert, he's known better to question God.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.940]   And he didn't want to lead these people because they already grumbled against him.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.940]   They were already questioning him.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.300]   Does God only speak through you?
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   Who are you?
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:52.980]   I mean, he didn't want this job to begin with, but he requests, "I will do what you tell
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.180]   me to do, but just show me your glory.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.300]   Because if you show me your glory, that would be enough for me to persevere."
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.180]   And so God says, "Yes, your request is good, and I will give it to you, but if I show you
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.420]   my full glory, you will die."
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.940]   So he says, "I will cover you, and then as I am passing, you will see my glory passing
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   by."
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.020]   And so Moses sees that, and his glory shining off of his face.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.160]   And so people recognized that he saw his glory.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.540]   And because of that, they established him, and they respected him, and followed him because
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.540]   of that glory.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:38.540]   So with all the mess, all the grumbling and complaining that he had to deal with for 40
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.500]   years, he said, "Give me your glory.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.740]   Let me see your glory."
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:47.340]   Do you think that maybe that's what Moses is thinking as they're entering into the promised
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.340]   land?
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.700]   "Lord, as we're going in there, and there's all kinds of stuff that's waiting for us,
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:58.860]   but if you would just show me again a glimpse of who you are, but not only to me, but to
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.140]   all of these children.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.980]   Let them see who you are.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:13.820]   And if they can see who you are, then we will be fine."
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:21.720]   Our greatest treasure, and I pray with all my heart that you would believe this with
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.900]   all your heart.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:30.620]   Our greatest treasure, you already have.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.600]   You already have it.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.720]   If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you already have it.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.740]   Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.100]   What God has already given you.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:50.640]   And then so that causes celebration, it causes joy, it causes work.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.020]   Think about the content of our prayer, "Lord, let me have this job.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.540]   Lord, let this investment work.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.060]   Lord, let me be healthy.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.220]   Lord, let me get this."
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.460]   Think about the content of this prayer and how trivial it must sound to an eternal holy
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.220]   God who desires so much to give us everything.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.380]   And we're begging for crumbs.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:25.140]   I pray that in 2019, that even the things that we petition may reflect the God that
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.340]   we are petitioning.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.320]   That we would open our eyes and see his glory.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.520]   Then he ends with this, "Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and confirm for
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.060]   us the work of our hands."
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.900]   Yes, confirm the work of our hands.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.940]   His prayer for revival isn't just passively waiting for God to work.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:49.820]   He says, "Lord, reveal your glory by making it shine off of our work."
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.580]   So we're getting to the promise line.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.660]   We're going to labor, we're going to work, we're going to worship.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:01.340]   But may your glory be revealed in your blessing upon us in what we do.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.380]   So in 2019, whether you eat or drink, whether it is in the church or outside the church,
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:12.660]   whether it's in business or in leisure, Lord, may your glory and majesty to be revealed
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   in what we do.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.820]   I pray that that would be our prayer.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.020]   Now with that, I'm going to transition to our India team.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.020]   Okay.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.020]   Was that a smooth transition?
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.020]   No?
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.580]   As you know, our team is headed out to India.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:32.380]   And again, we're out in India and our medical team, we have I think about five eye doctors
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:39.460]   or six eye doctors that are going out and we do a medical camp in the villages and we
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.980]   give them eyeglasses and some of the response is very dramatic because some of these people
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.900]   who are old couldn't see for a long time.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.980]   And so giving them eyeglasses is kind of like giving them sight for the first time.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.420]   So it's very effective.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.980]   And also we have a wound care team.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:57.520]   So our nurses and PAs, a few of them are coming to help us with that.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.500]   And then we have a VBS team who's running games with these children.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.220]   And again, some of you guys who've been with us know exactly what it's like, but VBS here
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.540]   is kind of like one of many.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:11.340]   In fact, when our kids were young, we probably went to like five or six VBSs in the summer
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.420]   because it's abundant and it's free.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.060]   But over there, any activity with children, especially in the poor villages, it's the
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.420]   first time ever running games and stuff.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.420]   So they love it.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.540]   So it's a good way for us to kind of bring the gospel into the villages.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.820]   And so our team is headed out.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.760]   And every year I get asked, how long are we going to do this?
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.380]   Because the persecution in India is ramping up.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:37.820]   And it's like right now, and I shared this before, when we first started going in, in
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:43.620]   the persecution meter, India was ranked maybe like 32 or 33.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.060]   It climbed up to number 11, meaning right under Syria, North Korea.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.820]   So it's gotten up there and it's actually moving up pretty fast.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:57.020]   And part of the reason why is because the government for the whole nation of India came
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.020]   from a very militant Hindu party.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.700]   So even though on paper it's illegal to persecute Christians, when they do that, nothing happens.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.160]   They don't get arrested, they don't go to jail.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.460]   So they become more emboldened through the years.
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.240]   And so they're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:17.900]   In fact, about four months ago, they targeted an Australian missionary and his kids, which
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.900]   is pretty big.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.820]   I mean, it's one thing to hurt the locals, but if you hurt a missionary, it's going to
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.880]   be an international thing.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.780]   But that's how emboldened they're becoming over there.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:32.380]   So people ask all the time, like, you know, how long can we go to India because of safety
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.380]   issues?
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.380]   We don't know.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.060]   Every year we come back, we think like we're going to have to evaluate the next year, see
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.780]   what happens.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:46.180]   But the work in India, it is so crystal clear that the fruit that it bears when we do go,
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.300]   that we believe that it's worth the discomfort.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.660]   And I'm not going to call it anything more than a discomfort, because it's just discomfort,
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.860]   because we're only there for a short period and we're back.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.340]   So it's not like we're risking our lives.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.620]   It's because we're weak sauce.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.820]   We live in Orange County, so we're not used to people even say, "You're a Christian?"
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   Persecution.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.820]   Right?
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.140]   So we're from here going over there.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:13.660]   So in comparison, it seems like we're doing hard work.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.380]   But in reality, it's the pastors there that we want to support.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.500]   We want to let them know that we have a church here praying for them and supporting them
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.820]   to do what we can.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.460]   And so I'm very thankful for all the people who are going.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.780]   There's 15 of us who are going to go.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:32.460]   Every single one of them have good paying jobs that they're sacrificing to get out there.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:38.260]   And it is a bit, it's very uncomfortable physically because of the travel and where we're at.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.140]   But if you guys can take some time to pray for them.
