[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   I grew up in Sacramento and both my parents were followers of Jesus.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.840]   They served in ministry at our local church and my mom played the organ and my dad sang
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.940]   in the choir.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.100]   Now throughout my childhood I always attended church, always attended Bible school and always
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.200]   went to youth group, yet the seemingly good track record that I had, the teachings of
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.800]   faith during these years really never penetrated me.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.280]   By the time I was in high school I remember becoming really jaded towards Christianity.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   I began thinking that the biblical stories of Adam and Eve, David and Goliath, Noah's
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.560]   Ark were just made up stories told to us as kids, similar to Santa Claus or the Tooth
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.960]   Fairy.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.360]   Also around this time I developed the perception that Jesus of Nazareth was just some guy with
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.720]   a magical ability to walk on water, to heal people, to turn water into wine.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.520]   So I ended up developing this really distorted and spurious view of Christianity and of Jesus.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.640]   Fast forward to my college years, in 2008 I left home to pursue my engineering degree
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.520]   at UCI and this started a new season of life for me.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.860]   I was fed a rich diet of science and reason, leading me to believe that truth could only
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.240]   be found in evidence-based rational thought.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.840]   Basically believing in things that could only be proven or physically observed.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.520]   And this rational world view always made sense to me on a fundamental level, while events
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.680]   that I read in the Bible did not.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.500]   Reconciling science and faith had always been a struggle for me, especially when it came
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   to describing the world that we live in.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.800]   It seemed less and less plausible that truth could be found in scripture and this ultimately
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.500]   led me to a point where I abandoned church, focusing on seeking answers through my education
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.000]   in science instead of faith.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.080]   Fortunately God is faithful and while we may abandon him, he will never abandon us.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.160]   For in Isaiah 42, 16, God says, "I will lead the blind in a way that they do not know,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.940]   and paths that they have not known, I will guide them."
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.180]   So as an act of grace, God began planning people in my life that he would use as tools
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.560]   to demonstrate his love and faithfulness for me, starting with the first time I heard the
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.620]   gospel outside of church.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.500]   He asked me, "If you were to die today and stand before God, and God asks, 'Why should
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.220]   I let you into my heaven?' what would you say?"
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.980]   Well I said, "I think I'm a pretty good person.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980]   I love my family.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.300]   I'm nice to other people.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780]   I went to church."
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.620]   He then introduced me to this foreign concept of being saved by faith and not by works.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.580]   Faith believing that Jesus lived and died for us and those who chose to repent and follow
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.020]   him would be delivered from the penalty of sin and given everlasting life.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.060]   Hearing this planted a seed of curiosity in me and caused me to question what I really
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.060]   knew about Jesus.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.740]   I also had a really good friend in college whom God had used to display his love and
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.300]   patience and relentless pursuit.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.460]   For two years this friend invited me to church and for two years I denied him.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.420]   But despite that he did not give up and he continued to invite me until we both graduated
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.220]   from college.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.420]   Little did I know that these small gestures would in time play a big role and play a big
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.340]   significance in bringing me to Christ.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.260]   Leading up to my senior year in college, the hardening of my heart had rendered me blind
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.620]   to the things of God.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.860]   I was living in a selfish life where I actively sinned and invested all my time and resources
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.940]   in worldly things.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.180]   Before I got to a point where I could really start looking at faith with an open mind,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.780]   something big had to happen.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.580]   And in February of 2013 I found out my cousin passed away from sudden cardiac arrest.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.000]   It was just one week after his 20th birthday.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.660]   He collapsed while walking back to his dorm and by the time paramedics arrived he could
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.660]   not be resuscitated.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.580]   I know it's a cliche thing to say but my cousin was one of my best friends.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.460]   I was in complete shock after hearing the news of his death and was unable to process
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.580]   what had happened.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.340]   In a blink of an eye I went from state of shock to all of a sudden realizing that I
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.420]   would never see him again.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.580]   That he would never be at another family gathering.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.740]   That he would end up missing all of the important events in my life.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.860]   I remember feeling so much pain, agony, confusion, being completely broken.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.620]   But to my surprise it was in this moment when I turned to God.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.700]   How could he do this to me?
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.380]   How could he take such an innocent life away from me?
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.200]   In John 19, 9-2 Jesus indicated that God in his mysterious and wise providence sometimes
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.900]   allows his children to go through hardship and suffering so that they can experience
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.260]   God's mercy and power in delivering them.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.700]   So the point being if you see tragedy and you know God could have stopped it, which
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.120]   he always could, but he didn't.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.580]   He must have a purpose in it.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.140]   After my cousin passed I could no longer sit idle and believe that we were just molecules
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.520]   in motion, that my feelings were just a series of chemical reactions and nothing else.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.780]   There had to be purpose.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.340]   There had to be a larger picture that I wasn't seeing.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.140]   This was the time when God allowed me to open my mind and seek truth in his word.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.540]   Now there's a Hebrew word that I've become really fond of in these past few weeks.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.020]   It's "shuv".
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.860]   The literal definition of this word is to turn back or return.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.980]   And the prophets in the Bible picked up this word and turned it into a powerful metaphor
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.980]   for how we relate to God.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.460]   Life is a journey and we go down certain roads and some roads don't lead to life.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.140]   Some roads lead to ruin.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.420]   And when you find yourself on this road you need to shuv.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.540]   You need to turn away from sin or your current way of life and turn back to Jesus.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.780]   This is the point where I stopped wanting to live a life of sin and selfishness and
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.100]   instead live a life for Christ.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.580]   Now fast forward to right now.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.420]   Standing before you today is a sinner, unworthy of God's love, unworthy to enter his kingdom.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.460]   In Romans 5a it says, "But God shows his love for us that while we were still sinners,
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.340]   Christ died for us."
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.780]   I've come to realize that the mercy and God's grace shows by sending Jesus to the
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.380]   cross is incomprehensible.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.020]   Ephesians 2a, "For by grace we have been saved through faith, not of works."
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.060]   Salvation is the greatest gift given to man, yet it's one that we never deserved.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.740]   God loved us so much that he sent his only son to become human and die on the cross for
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.980]   us.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.060]   And I find comfort knowing that God understands my struggles, my pain, and everything that
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.780]   I experience.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.220]   He knows me better than I know myself, for in Matthew 1030 God even knows the number
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.740]   of hairs on my head.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.540]   Before I even existed, God had his eyes on me.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.860]   He had his attention on me.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.120]   How faithful, how marvelous, how wonderful is he that despite my continuous rejection
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.460]   after all these years, he would still orchestrate his perfect plan to give me hope.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.700]   Hope in his word, hope in salvation, and hope in the promises rooted in the works of Christ.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.540]   Kevin, do you understand that when you go into the water you're uniting with Christ
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.020]   in his death, and that when you come out you're uniting with Christ in his resurrected life?
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:59.860]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.860]   My name is Paul Kim.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:10.860]   I am 52 years old, and I am only now coming to accept Jesus Christ as my Savior and accepting
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.700]   that fact that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:27.380]   Today I am asking him to be the ruler of my life.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.420]   I'm the older brother to Pastor Peter and the elder Philip Kim, and father of three
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.780]   sons.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.020]   My father was a pastor, as was my grandfather.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.660]   Although I grew up in a Christian family and always been around people who were dedicated
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:50.820]   to serving God, I never really seriously evaluated my own relationship with God.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.900]   I was a Christian by default, meaning I thought I was a Christian because I always hung around
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:04.860]   the church, people I hung around with was Christian.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:14.060]   So I didn't really realize that I had to work at being Christian.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.420]   I was at church, but I didn't really have the faith.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.780]   I prayed, but without conviction.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:29.580]   I didn't really think there was a process to being a Christian.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:40.380]   I didn't realize that being a Christian was difficult.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.140]   You really had to work at it.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.140]   You had to be diligent.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.700]   Keeping faith was like every moment kind of thing.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:00.740]   I never thought I was a bad person, so I never really thought I had to accept Jesus Christ.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.740]   The problem was I wasn't a Christian.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:13.780]   Excuse me.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:26.140]   Oh, boy.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.100]   I know how to be a Christian, but I was too lazy to practice it and kept falling deeper
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.380]   and deeper into worldly temptations.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:43.340]   In 52 years of existence, I made many mistakes along the way.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.580]   I can honestly tell you every time I come to a fork in the road where I have to make
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:59.220]   a difficult choice, I have consistently made the wrong choices.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:13.300]   My friends and family who cared about me witnessed the path that was conducive to a life of failure.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:26.180]   At 52, I know that I lived my life as a sinner.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:36.260]   I can honestly tell you that I made wrong choices despite people who were encouraging
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.580]   me and counseling me.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:54.740]   I had the right answers with me all the time, I knew, but I refused to listen.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:01.380]   I was stubborn and made continuous mistakes.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:13.340]   You know, the choices I made were conscious because it was easier to live as a sinner
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:26.940]   than it was to live as a Christian.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:35.140]   There were many times I regretted being so far away from God.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:45.620]   Despite being born into a Christian family where I could have found Jesus Christ easily,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:52.020]   I regretted because I did not like myself or where I was headed.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:13:01.620]   And there were many times I regretted because I have failed many times.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:18.740]   People ask me why after all these years, I am coming before Christ now.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:24.740]   That you have to ask God.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:41.940]   You have to ask God because at 52 years old, I can tell you that all these years amounted
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:54.100]   to years of sin.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:01.860]   And there were no denying it anymore.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:23.100]   At 52, despite years of making wrong choices and living life as a sinner, I know.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:30.100]   There was divine intervention.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:44.100]   Mitchell, you got your wish.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:52.460]   Oh boy.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.340]   Why now?
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.140]   Because I am weak.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:13.700]   For 52 years I tried and I couldn't do it on my own will.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:33.620]   I am saved only by the grace of God.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:43.620]   And at 52, I thank God that I am saved before it was too late.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.820]   You understand that when you go into the water, you are united with Christ in the depth.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.620]   And when you come out, you are united with Christ, resurrected life.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:06.620]   In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.460]   Hello, my name is Matthew Yee and this is my testimony.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.500]   So very fortunate to have been able to grow up in a Christian home, attending a church
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.460]   of the name Ocean View in Torrance regularly on Sundays.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.260]   As a result, during the early years of my life, I had been exposed to many different
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.900]   stories of the Bible.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.100]   However, these stories played very little significance to my life, possibly due to my
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.020]   young age, but mostly because of my lack of understanding of God's character.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.620]   So my family attended Ocean View Church up until I was about nine years old.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.320]   My parents had decided to look for a new church, and we stumbled upon, at the time, a pretty
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   small church.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.660]   And you guys might have heard of it.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.460]   It's called Berean Community Church.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.380]   And I still remember on my first day, I was very intimidated, just because of the change
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.380]   and stuff.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.100]   And I joined a younger kids for service where we played basketball with a younger James
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:05.060]   Hong and I didn't miss a shot.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.740]   And week by week went by, and my family had found a new fellowship at Berean.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.860]   And I attended the main service along with my older brother and the Kim boys, where literally
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.740]   every sermon went way over my head.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:21.540]   However, in a short while, God graciously provided a youth group at Berean under the
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.100]   leadership of Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.580]   So under Pastor Peter Chung was where I believe God really began to work my life within the
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.580]   youth group.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.620]   I became convicted of my sins and my relationship to God.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.660]   And I can't pinpoint an exact day, but it was around this time in my life where I repented
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.500]   of my sin for the first time.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.180]   I was convicted to read my Bible and pray to understand more about God and sought opportunities
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.460]   to share the gospel with my middle school friends.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.060]   And then high school came along.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.720]   So high school quickly came, and with the change of scenery, also came new temptations
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.300]   in my life.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.460]   Throughout high school, I struggled greatly with my identity in Christ and constantly
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.460]   had battles with two specific sins, idolatry and lust.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.700]   So first off, speaking on idolatry, I idolized high school sports, and I constantly wanted
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:19.220]   to get better at football and basketball, even though I wasn't really much of an athlete.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.660]   I had many spiritual battles concerning sports, but I felt as if my faith was ultimately going
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   downhill.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.820]   And sports slowly began to consume my thoughts, and it no longer became a matter of how I
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.780]   could glorify God through sports, but rather how I could glorify myself.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.100]   And then secondly, lust, it became very apparent in my decision-making, where I began dating
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.100]   a non-Christian girl my senior year.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.420]   And the effects of my decision to date her would carry over into my first years of college
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420]   as well.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:54.100]   So college, I had a ton of trouble adjusting to college and the college ministry at Bremen.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.300]   I was struggling with school, and possibly due to my awkwardness or antisocial tendencies,
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.700]   I was having a hard time adjusting to the new ministry.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.860]   However, it was ultimately my sinful thinking and my commitment to my non-Christian girlfriend
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.860]   at the time that convinced me to believe that I did not need fellowship.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.660]   I really struggled during this time, constantly being convicted to end the relationship and
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.020]   pursue my faith and fellowship with other believers, but not being able to commit to
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.460]   that conviction.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.940]   My heart felt like it was in a constant tug, and I was in and out of the relationship,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.980]   but also in and out of church.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.900]   And just like Proverbs 26, 11 states, "Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.500]   who repeats his folly."
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   And that was me.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:44.700]   I was constantly returning to my vomit, not my ex-girlfriend, but my sin.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.220]   And I was just that fool, making compromise after compromise to my faith, to the point
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.100]   of where I stopped attending church for a while, due to the increased feelings of this
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.100]   guilt and doubt of my faith.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.460]   So at this time, the feelings of guilt and doubt were really weighing me down, and the
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.860]   relationship wasn't going well.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:10.460]   And I just began to turn to worldly things for my stress and anxiety, and just for comfort,
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.740]   only to realize how temporary those things were.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.140]   And it was during this time that I just had a moment of repentance for the first time
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.660]   in a long time.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:29.420]   I was at the lowest of my lows, and I admitted my weakness to God, just how dependent I was
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.580]   on Him.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:37.140]   I confessed my sins and asked for forgiveness.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:43.100]   However, the biggest difference between this time and throughout high school, I think,
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.580]   was that I really relied on God to help me commit to my convictions, instead of just
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.980]   being wavering and kind of shaky with my faith.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.740]   And so I really wanted to commit to my convictions, and I wanted to act with my faith out.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.460]   So I ended the relationship.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.860]   I disengaged in the worldly activities I was partaking in, and I started getting plugged
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.360]   back into church.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.900]   And by God's grace, I'm here today.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.660]   And the truth of the gospel has never meant more to me than it does now.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.580]   And as Philippians 1:6 states, "And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.300]   in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:26.740]   And despite my hardship through sin, by God's grace and God's grace alone, I'm here today.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.620]   And this all ultimately points back to the cross, that God being holy and intolerant
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.900]   of sin, knowing of the sin I struggle with, the sin I may struggle with now and the sin
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:43.700]   I might struggle with in the future, he still sent his son, Jesus Christ, to die for my
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.300]   sin and resurrect to conquer my sin.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:53.620]   I'm not perfect, nor do I fully understand the character of God, but the truth of the
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.580]   gospel is what allows me to persevere through trials and actually live up my faith.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.140]   And I just want to share Galatians 2.20, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.100]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.660]   In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.940]   gave himself for me."
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.940]   Thank you.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.940]   Thank you.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.940]   We've been waiting for you.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:25.860]   You understand when you go into the water that you are united with Christ in his death,
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.060]   and then when you come out, you're united with his resurrected life.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:38.020]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.020]   Hi.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.020]   I'm Esther Yam.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.740]   I'm a fourth year UCI student.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.460]   So I was born into a Christian home with a loving family.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.740]   I went to church every Sunday, and I thought, and like, although I could answer all the
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.900]   questions during Sunday service or like Bible study, like, it took me 19 years to realize
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.560]   that I wasn't a genuine Christian.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.820]   In the seventh grade, I would use these little tests to determine if I was truly saved or
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.820]   not.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.820]   Did I cry during prayer?
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.220]   Did I jump up and down during praise?
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.180]   Yeah, I did.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.900]   But that hype never lasted long.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:26.260]   In fact, the only times I felt close to God was during retreats or during worship nights.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.660]   Truthfully, that was all because of like a spiritual high.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:36.060]   It was something that the music had done to me.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.220]   And when I resumed my everyday life, I lived for myself.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.700]   Prayer only on Sundays.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.420]   Singing praises only on Sundays.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.500]   And devotions, never.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.860]   I didn't even know what they were.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:54.500]   Despite this, I got baptized in the ninth grade because everyone else was doing it,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.460]   you know, and I wanted to take my faith seriously.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.620]   Yet by 12th grade, I had burnt out.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.100]   I felt no emotion, no love, nothing for God.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.420]   I stopped attending service.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.340]   Every time something bad happened to me, I would ask God, "Why?
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   Why me?
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.820]   Why would you do this to me?"
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.220]   When I entered college, an older sister tried to go through a little gospel booklet with
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.620]   me, but I told her straight up, I said, "I know everything.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.340]   I don't want to talk about God."
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.140]   Yet I still considered myself to be a Christian.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:36.580]   I believed that God was real, but I was living in sin without a second thought.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.480]   And the only time I would think about him was when I cursed him for doing something
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.380]   so bad to me, for ruining my life.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.380]   It's funny though.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.300]   Like, I have a friend who was Catholic at the time.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.620]   She invited me to check out CCM because her sister wanted to check it out because her
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.220]   sister's friend told her to check it out.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.100]   And I thought, "Oh, it's a Christian ministry.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.020]   I got to make sure it isn't a cult."
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.820]   So I went.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.780]   But there was something different about these people.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.140]   They encouraged me to check out Burian, and I did.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:19.180]   The sermons, and everyone encouraged me to read the word and stuff like that.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:25.100]   But I decided to take my faith seriously again.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.300]   I tried not to sin.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   I did my devos.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.300]   I prayed.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.860]   I worked so hard to stay holy, but nothing worked.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:40.780]   I was still giving into my sins, and I began to think that I would always live in my sin.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.300]   Every time God gave me a trial, I would hate him because I knew I wasn't able to do the
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.220]   right thing.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.380]   I thought he was trying to trick me into sin.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:55.340]   I thought he was throwing me into temptation just to get back at me for cursing him.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.620]   That was the case until the summer of my freshman year.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.220]   I read John 3, 17, which states, "For God did not send his son into the world to condemn
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.620]   the world, but in order that the world might be saved."
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.400]   And then it all clicked.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.100]   It happened so suddenly and out of nowhere.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.460]   God was so merciful to me.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.260]   He was the one who opened my mind.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.780]   He was the one who revealed himself, and he was the one who saved me.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.860]   God wasn't out there to get me.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.140]   He wasn't out there to trick me into sinning.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.100]   Instead, he showed me love.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   He sent his son.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   He chose me.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.020]   He gave me salvation.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:34.700]   Rather than thinking, "I'm safe," I felt so ashamed.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.100]   I understood the weight of my own sins.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.580]   I repented, and I understood that I was completely deserving of his wrath.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.380]   Yet he showed me love.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.740]   Now rather than trying to find security in my works, I find security in Christ.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.580]   It's my love for Christ that makes me yearn to learn more about him, that makes me pray.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.480]   He makes me eager to talk about him.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.060]   And whenever a trial comes my way, I trust in God, and I trust in the plan he had all
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.500]   ready set out for me.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.300]   I give it all up to him.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   So when I asked my mom about this baptism a couple years ago, she's like, "Why do you
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   need to do it again?
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.580]   You already did it in like ninth grade."
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.580]   And I thought, "Huh.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.500]   Yeah, I did."
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.700]   So there was a time when I wondered if I was really saved during my baptism in ninth grade.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:36.140]   I used to struggle with that a lot, but then I came to realize, no, I was not saved.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.780]   I was not dead to sin.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.900]   I was not alive in God.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.300]   My desire to get baptized again is because I know the importance of baptism in my saving
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.900]   faith.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.740]   I'm not proclaiming this because my friends had done before me, but I'm proclaiming Christ
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.900]   as my savior because I am of Christ.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.540]   I already have been baptized by the spirit in his death and resurrection.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.540]   Thank you.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.540]   So you understand that when you go into the water, you're united with Christ in his death.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.100]   And when you come out, you're united with Christ in his resurrected life.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:17.140]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.580]   Hi, everybody.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:30.260]   My name is Alex Chang, and I'm here to share my testimony.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:37.940]   As I kid, I grew up in a Christian household, and I also went to a private Christian school.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:44.860]   I always felt that I was Christian just because of all the people that I was surrounded by.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:51.660]   Just always being in that environment, I just assumed that I must be Christian because that's
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.100]   just who everybody in my family is.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.660]   That's who all my friends are.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   I even loved going to Sunday school and learning about God and Jesus.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:08.380]   I felt that all these stories that I was learning was just so crazy that there's such a thing
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:14.620]   as a God that sent someone to come save us.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:20.660]   But as a kid, I only really wanted to just have the knowledge about him, not really knowing
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.260]   and trying to develop a relationship with him.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.820]   So as a kid, I idolized popularity and knowledge.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:38.180]   And so I'd always ask, like during Sunday school, who God was.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.260]   I always just wanted to know the answer.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.500]   I just treated Sunday school like regular school, just wanted to know everything for
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.620]   the sake of knowing it.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.320]   So as a kid, my concept of Christianity was just to be nice to others, especially because
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.480]   as a kid, I was taught the golden rule, treat others as you would have yourself be treated.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.020]   And since I believe I was just being a nice guy, that was the only thing I needed to do
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.020]   in order to become a Christian.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:10.660]   In seventh grade, did I truly grasp and understand the significance of Christ's death?
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.340]   Every year prior to that, I just thought, since I knew everything about it, that I was
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.340]   saved.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:25.460]   But luckily, on a Good Friday service, my youth pastor finally revealed the significance
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.360]   of it, the gravity of what Christ had done for us.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:36.000]   Even at that point where Christ, he already performed all these miracles for all these
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.960]   people, for the Jews.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.160]   On that day, they still decided to turn on him.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.080]   And he was so willing to go to the cross and save them, those who cursed him, mocked him,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.160]   even spat on him, but he saved every single one of them.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:01.000]   Not just them, but even me, to save my sins past, present, and future.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.960]   At that time, a huge wave of emotions crashed over me because I was just so ignorant and
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.800]   arrogant at the time.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   I was overlooked at what God has given me, his grace.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:18.120]   And I thought to myself, me, an undeserving sinner, has been given another chance to be
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.160]   reunited with him, a God who created me and loves me.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.200]   I realized that I was just trying to be a good person and be better than everybody else.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.480]   But then finally realized that I would never be able to live up to God's standard, which
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.580]   is Christ Jesus.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.560]   On that day, I devoted my life to Christ.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.920]   I repented from my sins and asked for forgiveness.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.960]   I asked God to forgive me for claiming to be a Christian without truly knowing him.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:51.760]   From then on, I had this passion to serve others and truly care for them and to be able
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.280]   to live a life that would glorify God.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.080]   So luckily I had opportunities such as Mount Hermon, this Christian camp, where I was able
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.520]   to truly apply what I learned and also go on to mission trips where I can truly share
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.480]   God's love to others by witnessing to them, as well as have the opportunity to build houses
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   for them.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   Thank you.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:19.560]   You understand when you go into the water, you're reunited with Christ and his death.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.160]   And then when you come out, you're united with Christ and his new resurrected life.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:34.720]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.480]   Hello, I'm James Lau.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.160]   There's a lot of you guys, so I'm pretty nervous.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.960]   So I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I grew up in a house with two God-fearing
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.360]   parents who brought me to church every Sunday.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.960]   Despite this, I would say I did not truly know or love God for most of my life.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.440]   I went to church, but if you asked me at the time what the gospel was, I probably wouldn't
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.400]   be able to have told you.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   To me, church at the time was just a place to go every Sunday to see my church friends,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.480]   with the possibility to hang out with them afterwards.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.960]   Who God was and what Jesus did on the cross on my behalf had no impact on my life, and
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.120]   I lived a sinful lifestyle daily.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:31.840]   During high school, my worldliness manifested in the way that I disobeyed my parents constantly,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.760]   and in the things and relationships that I pursued.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.920]   I know it was bad because sometimes I talk to my parents now, and they tell me, "Yeah,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.480]   I was bad," and they didn't know what to do with me at the time.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.680]   It's humbling to look back now and think that they were constantly praying for me, despite
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.960]   how much I didn't care.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:01.580]   My heart was hardened to both my parents and, more importantly, to God.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.520]   So during my junior year of high school, a friend invited me to a praise and prayer
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.400]   night at one of the churches.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.320]   I went mostly because I didn't know how to say no to that friend.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.640]   I don't actually remember much about that night, other than the praise and prayer being
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:24.160]   really loud, and remembering that, feeling convicted that if I continued living the way
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.680]   I did, I would surely end up in hell.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.920]   I remember praying that night and confessing that I was helpless in my struggle towards
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   sin and for God to take control of my life.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:43.880]   I don't think I was actually saved after that, but I see that as the time where God started
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:50.460]   to soften my heart and when I started seeing the need for God in my life.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.680]   When I entered college, I began to check out campus ministries and eventually wound up
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.680]   at one my roommate brought me out to.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:04.240]   I think one of the things that stuck out and convicted me in the ministry was I remember
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:10.040]   seeing a lot of guys there being genuinely excited to go pray and read the Bible and
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:17.620]   witness and me kind of wondering why I didn't share the same fervor as them.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:23.840]   Also growing up, I always thought that if I acknowledged that God existed, that that
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.940]   itself was sufficient for salvation.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:33.120]   So when a friend invited me to join him in listening to a sermon by I think Paul Washer
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:41.600]   on Matthew 7 and hearing him preach on how not only is the gate narrow, but the way leading
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.860]   to the gate is narrow, I remember feeling completely devastated and walking away questioning
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:53.440]   whether my faith was actually saving faith.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:59.960]   So I don't know if any specific event triggered me to go, "Oh, now I'm saved," and I don't
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:06.080]   know the exact time or day when God saved me, but I would say during that time, the
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:12.400]   first couple years in college is when God began to remove my heart of stone and replace
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.880]   it with the heart of flesh.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:20.520]   Somewhere during that time, I began to understand that despite how surely on my own I was heading
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:28.040]   towards the gate that leads to destruction, God still chose to send his son down to pay
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.900]   the ransom for my sin.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:37.160]   I remember growing up on Sundays, I would sometimes confess sins that I committed throughout
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:45.640]   the week, but I think there's a difference in repentance when I finally understood the
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:52.520]   weight of who God was and what he sacrificed in order that I might be saved.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:58.360]   Today I'm far from a perfect person and I often struggle between my natural tendency
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:05.880]   to sin and my desire to be obedient and to submit to God in every part of my life.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:12.240]   Despite my imperfection, I am still able to identify in Christ and his death as I put
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.920]   down my old self and continue to deny myself daily.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.640]   I'm able to also identify with him in his resurrection in which I can share Jesus'
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.920]   victory over sin in my life.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.400]   James, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.480]   in his death, and then when you come out, you're uniting with Christ's resurrected
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   life?
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:43.560]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
