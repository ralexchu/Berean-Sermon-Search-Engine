[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820]   Alright, so if we don't have any other announcer, why don't we turn our Bibles to 2nd Timothy chapter 2
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.380]   I'm gonna be mainly focused on verse 22, but chapter 2 22 through 26
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.200]   Chapter 2 22 to 26. I'm gonna read out of the ESV
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.520]   Have nothing to do with foolish ignorant controversies, you know that they breed quarrels and the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.980]   But kind to everyone able to teach patiently enduring evil
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.080]   Correcting his opponents with gentleness God may perhaps grant them repentance
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.000]   Leading to a knowledge of the truth and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.760]   After being captured by him to do his will. Let's pray
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   Gracious and loving father we thank you so much for today
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.160]   And we know father what a privilege it is
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.240]   For us to be able to pray to you to come and worship you father God
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.440]   And again, we know that there are many brothers and sisters around the world who are in the most midst of heavy persecution
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.540]   We ask that you would surround them and protect them strengthen their faith Lord God
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.680]   That in the midst of persecution and and many of them even martyred them Lord
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.120]   That more and more people may know that the hope that we have in Christ is not something that we've made up
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.000]   That you are a God who loves you're a God who is merciful
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.360]   That we worship a Savior who has resurrected from the dead
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   That we would live our life Lord God fullest for your glory
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.080]   So for that and we pray for your blessing this morning in Jesus name we pray. Amen
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.160]   You know around this time of the year
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.600]   Obviously because of the students coming back and there's a lot of changes that always takes place
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.560]   You know and not just this time of the year because our church is you know, somewhat young
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   I don't say somewhat it is young and so there's constant changes and those of you who just came into college
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.440]   College is going to rock your world
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.920]   All right next four years is gonna change your life
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.640]   I mean, I see so many people come to college and you know by the time they get back home after four years
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   They realize everything has changed your friends has changed. You know, what what you experience has changed
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.280]   So it gets harder and harder to go jump back in because you don't realize how much things are changing until you go back home
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.600]   But it's not just a collegiance, you know
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.680]   There's some of you who just recently graduated and and you're working and your world is being rocked right now
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.940]   You know waking up every day at 6 in the morning to try to get the work and then come in a Bible study and all
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.200]   That you're adjusting to this new schedule. So you you are going through a lot of changes
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.820]   Some of you who are just got married or in the in the process of getting married right now
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.580]   I mean your world is gonna get rocked and you can tell even visually, you know, especially with the guys
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.120]   I don't see a whole lot of change with girls
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.180]   But with guys even the way they dress change when they meet the right person, you know
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.900]   I mean their hairstyle changes all of a sudden you start wearing button-down shirts and you know, and you take shower regularly
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.720]   I mean, there's a lot of things
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.640]   Changes, you know, then those of you who are young couples who have children
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   And obviously that's another thing's gonna rock your world and you you start seeing changes, right?
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.840]   There's a lot of things that happen, especially when we're young, you know our life changes
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.360]   And so when our life changes, there's external things
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.840]   Like I said, you can even tell physically the way you talk what you value
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.900]   You know what you're hoping for what you consider to be entertaining all of these things are going through process of change
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.280]   But I can say of all the things that we experience in life that changes
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.840]   There's nothing more radical than when we meet Christ
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   When somebody becomes a Christian that a lot of times the people who knew you before you met Christ
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.960]   They don't even recognize who you are. Like what happened to you?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.400]   right and it's not just a small change when we meet Christ and and someone who was once lost in sin and
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.460]   is found in Christ there has to be no almost always is a
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.920]   Radical change our speech changes our weekends change what we pursue change
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.840]   But the challenge that we have and I know that every every genuine believer who meets Christ goes through a radical change
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.320]   But if you've been a Christian for a while
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.100]   Three years four years, maybe ten plus years
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100]   You know
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.260]   We get to a point where we need to plateau in our walk with God and then we begin to think you know that change
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.700]   Happened when I first met Christ, but after that we hit a plateau and we just kind of learned to coast
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.980]   and we're in the beginning when you begin to cause you you get a little bit frustrated because you feel I'm just kind of stagnant and
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.640]   I don't have that kind of same passion that I did before and you begin to look around your your other peers and you see
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   Well, everybody else is going through the same thing
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.660]   So what end up happening is you begin to adjust and think maybe this is normal
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.260]   Maybe that passion and this this passionate pursuit of Christ is just something that happens when you initially meet Christ
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.880]   But after you've been a Christian for a while, maybe plateauing is normal
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.940]   but the problem with that type of thinking is
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.460]   Every time you look in Scripture again, it screams out
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.700]   Apostle Paul as he is sitting in prison after 30 40 years of ministry. He talks about straining
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.760]   He's talks about fighting to the end. You know Timothy
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.180]   Was not a newbie, you know, that's a term that's that use now. I'm pretty sure I'm using it correctly, right?
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.180]   He's a newbie. He's not a newbie in ministry
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.880]   He's been with Paul through various trials when Paul was put into prison the first time Timothy was with him
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.020]   Timothy joined him early part of the second missionary journey
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.820]   So it wasn't like Timothy all of a sudden joined ministry and as a young pastor
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.820]   She started facing trials and all of a sudden he's shocked and he's thinking about going back home
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.500]   No, Timothy went through all these trials. He was there when Paul was shipwrecked
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.100]   He was there when he was put into prison and and stoned and he was he was there through all of that
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.720]   But the trial that they're facing now was much greater than anything that they've seen before and probably one of the greatest
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.740]   Discouragement with Timothy is that all these older men that traveled with Paul some of them are beginning to fall away and go back home
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.020]   So he's beginning to experience timidity
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.940]   And maybe he's beginning to contemplate maybe maybe I've done enough
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.540]   I mean I sacrifice and I gave and you know, I had hardship
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.180]   I mean, I've done my part let the other guys do it and it's in that context
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.660]   Paul writes this letter second Timothy telling Timothy to persevere
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.940]   To continue that you're on this right path. This persecution is not coming because you made the wrong choice
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.660]   You know, you could have gone left you could have gone, right?
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.500]   You could have want went to this city and you could instead of going to that city whenever we face hardship
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.200]   We begin to rethink the decisions that we made and we begin to think that maybe if I made that choice
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.040]   This hardship would not be here. Maybe if I went to this school, maybe if I want to jack that job
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.420]   Maybe because I made the wrong decision. These things are happening
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.460]   Instead Paul reminds Timothy said these things are happening because you're on the right path
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.300]   These hardships and persecutions are coming your way because you are following the Lord and he
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.140]   Challenges him to continue to persevere in this fight, even if you give your life
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.820]   You will find true life in Christ
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.940]   the Paul
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.460]   We talked about a couple weeks ago in verse 22
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.460]   He's talking about how to continue to persevere. And so the first thing that we looked at was to flee
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.620]   Paul says you must flee in your walk with God. You must flee you cannot
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.800]   Love the world and love God at the same time no matter how hard you try
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.980]   You you want the church to change you want the world to change but it's just not going to change God's Word will stand
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.700]   What he said?
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.540]   2,000 years ago what he does today and what we he will do tomorrow. He will never contradict himself
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.620]   So when he says you cannot love the world and love God at the same time
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.420]   It is consistent even today no matter how hard you try
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.260]   So he says you must flee you must run from this but the second part of it
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.540]   He says not only must you flee but you must pursue righteousness faith love and peace
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.100]   Along with those who call on the name of the Lord from a pure heart
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.740]   You know some of us at least in the beginning of our walk with God try so hard to flee from the world
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.260]   And after a while you may have gotten tired and you thinking you know, this is too hard
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.660]   You know every time you go to school you watch TV and there's just temptations around us all the time
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.660]   How can we possibly fight this?
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.000]   And so you just kind of learn to compromise as long as you're not in blatant sin
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.900]   You know long as you're not getting drunk and you've kind of pushed the envelope to the point where you can enjoy the world
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.140]   And not go over the edge. So you're always living on the edge
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.780]   Because you're always tempted
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.940]   Every once in a while you might step over but it's kind of like oh, that's a mistake
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.620]   See when we're only fleeing from the world and you don't understand what it means to pursue Christ
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.460]   You may feel safe living on the border
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.060]   Your whole life is a gray area
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.820]   See this second part of pursuing Christ pursuing righteousness
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.660]   That word is the same word that Paul uses
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.340]   to describe persecution
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.580]   in fact that word that same word that he describes to pursue is
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.860]   The same word that he uses in Galatians 1 13 when he describes how he used to be
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:37.140]   It says in Galatians 1 13 for you have heard of my former life in Judaism how I persecuted the Church of God
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.260]   violently and tried to destroy it
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:48.860]   So Paul used that same word persecuted here to challenge Timothy to pursue righteousness. It is not a passive word
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.620]   You know think about it when Paul took responsibility for the stoning of Stephen
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.980]   It was not legal for him to do that when they took off their cloaks and put it at Paul's feet
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:05.740]   Paul was taking responsibility for this murder if the Romans found out what happened. He could have been executed for that
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.500]   So when Paul says he persecuted the church, he basically was saying I'm willing to die
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.300]   That wasn't enough
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.340]   He got permission from the chief priests and the Jewish leaders to get a small army
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.460]   With him and begin to chase these Christians out way over into Damascus
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.220]   And the reason why he was targeting Damascus is as dark
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.140]   Damascus is as far as you can go under the authority of the chief priests
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:38.100]   So basically what Paul was doing was he was pouring his life out to persecute these Christians
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.260]   And it is in that context as he's going to Damascus. He meets Christ and his life is turned flipped upside down
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.300]   He used that same word to encourage and challenge Timothy to
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.660]   passionately pursue these things
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.780]   Think about all the things that we pursue with all our might
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:03.060]   And again, I don't mean to make some of you feel bad. But you know when the iPhone came out you see this long line
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.020]   You know going around the corner. Some of them said they were standing for two days
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.980]   Right because they want to be the first to have the iPhone to play the games and to show people they they were the first
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.500]   right
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.020]   Now we go through all of that to pursue a phone
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.180]   But
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.880]   What kind of effort are we putting toward pursuing the things of God?
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:32.340]   See, that's the word that he's describing. In fact, that same word is translated in the New Testament to pursue and
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:41.060]   It's translated persecute 30 separate times. In fact, it is more common to translate this word to persecute and he's reminding Timothy
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.220]   Our walk with God is not it's gonna be a cakewalk
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.300]   It's not just choosing the right church and you just kind of go with the flow
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.820]   I hear the right sermons and just gonna go with the flow. It's gonna require
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.300]   vigorous effort
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.560]   That's one thing that and I was sharing with our leaders yesterday as I was meditating on
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.220]   Thessalonians and I look at Paul's life and
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:08.420]   He lived every single day preaching the gospel because he lived as if it mattered whether he preached it or not
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.740]   It mattered whether he he prayed or not
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.900]   It mattered whether he persevered or not
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:22.020]   He was concerned that the Thessalonians after they heard the gospel that they were gonna fall back because of persecution and he writes to them
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.520]   He says I was afraid that my labor would have been in vain
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.340]   He didn't just step back and say God is sovereign
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.780]   So I just gonna trust God and I'm I'm just gonna live in peace. He doesn't say that
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.340]   He lived
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.180]   vigorously as if he was in a midst of context of war
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.740]   Even as he is being persecuted as he is in prison. He never relaxed
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.060]   You know
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.860]   There's a there's a sense in our culture that we think that if we're mature
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.540]   And if we know who God is and Lord, he's sovereign that we're Calvinist that we should just relax
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:02.060]   Read the Bible and relax come to church and just relax. Well, I don't see that with Paul
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.860]   He's the one who teaches us about sovereignty
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:13.060]   He's the one who teaches about election and yet I see a man who every single day lived as if everything he did mattered
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:19.360]   And the reason why he did that because it did it matters. It matters what we do
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.340]   It matters what we do with our time. It matters what we do with our money. It matters if we pray
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.460]   It matters if we share the gospel it matters
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.700]   And that's why Paul is telling Timothy
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.900]   To passionately pursue these things, but I want to go through in this pursuit
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:44.060]   Like what is it exactly that he is asking us to pursue and I can sit here and and tell you about what is righteousness?
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.060]   And what is faith? What is?
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.820]   Pursuing love means what is pursuing peace means but in the end
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:56.780]   If you see these things as simply as the end goal pursuing righteousness
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.500]   You're gonna miss the whole point of what Paul is trying to tell Timothy
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.100]   So I'm not gonna spend this morning expositing what righteousness what love is what peace is
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.860]   Because I want you to understand that these things that he is calling us to do is only a means to the ultimate end
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:19.260]   You know Paul says in first Corinthians 9 26, so I do not run aimlessly I do not box as one beating the air
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:25.960]   Right, whether you are beating the air whether you're running aimlessly, you're gonna pour out energy
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:32.860]   But the difference is if you're beating the air aimlessly if you're boxing aimlessly at the end result you accomplish nothing
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.700]   Instead of and just spent the same amount of energy
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.540]   But all you all you did was box the air
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.380]   Sometimes Christian life feels exactly like that
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.780]   You know those of you who were young Christians and you're excited about your faith and you say ah
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.820]   Yeah, I read the Bible pray go to church and you're excited about it
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.420]   Those of you who've been a Christian for five years ten years fifteen years plus
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.340]   You kind of have this thing that you know what I've done all of this and I know how to play the game
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.660]   I know what to say. I've read my scripture. I know the fundamentals of Christianity now what?
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.580]   Again I want to I want
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:14.420]   I'm not gonna sit here and talk about the each detailed words because I want to go beyond that and see the bigger picture
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.260]   It's kind of like an individual if you go into the army and
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:26.940]   You get basic training right and everybody goes to the basic training because you're being taught how to be a soldier
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.140]   How you should dress how you should sleep how you should wake up how you should?
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.100]   March how to hold the gun how to shoot a gun and it's basic training, right?
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.380]   But if you got into the army and all you did was basic training
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.620]   After about three four years, you're like, okay. All right, we're marching again
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.580]   Right wake up in the early morning and he blows a whistle and then we're marching again
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.140]   After a while, you're like, what is this?
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.140]   See basic training is to train you for something else. It's a means
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.980]   for the ultimate goal
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:05.600]   But if you think the basic training and making your bed and marching properly that that's the goal, it'll become old real quick
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.860]   See, that's what pursuing righteousness love faith and peace will feel like at times when you don't see the bigger picture
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:20.420]   And all you think is being a being a passionate pursuer of these things is is this do the right things, right?
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:27.500]   Have the right theology put enough time in prayer, you know serve the homeless and and we have all of these things
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.620]   But after a while all we've learned how to do is look like a Christian
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.980]   like a soldier
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:39.440]   You've dressed yourself up and you know how to dress and you know how to talk and you know what to do and you know
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.480]   How to take commands, but all you've done is learn how to look like a soldier
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.220]   Oftentimes that's what our Christian pursuit feels like
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.160]   We're just learning how to put on the uniform of a Christian
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.600]   And so when we talk about pursuing righteousness, we're doing all these things
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.280]   But in the end it feels like you're running it in circles. You're not getting anywhere
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.540]   What is it exactly that he that we are pursuing?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.300]   If these are just a means to get there, what are we pursuing?
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:15.520]   You know Paul says first Timothy 6 5 he said a lot of these guys a lot of these false teachers are coming
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.900]   They are depraved mind the depraved of the truth
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:23.960]   Imagining that godliness is a means of gain now. There is great gain in godliness with contentment
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:30.720]   In other words, these guys are using godliness to gain something but they're missing the whole point of godliness itself
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.400]   if you understand what the gut godliness is for and
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   You are content about it. It's great game. But if godliness is only only through it that you're gonna gain something else
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.120]   You're missing the whole point. That's what these guys say
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.760]   They think that godliness is is for the purpose of gaining something else
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.080]   Think about it in the church how often we do things because we want to look a certain way to certain people
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   How often do we do certain things because we're leaders. That's what leaders are supposed to do
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.240]   How much are we how much of what we do because oh, we're a member of brain. So this is what's expected
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.920]   So so we do these things and in some way we're gaining the respect
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.080]   We're gaining honor by doing all of these things
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.520]   But Paul says in Philippians 3 12 to 14. He says anyone who is mature should have the same attitude of Paul
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.160]   But this is what he says
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.120]   He starts out in verse 12 said not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.480]   But I press on to make it my own
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.760]   Because Christ Jesus had made me his own brothers
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.440]   I do not consider that I have made it my own but one thing I do forgetting what lies behind and
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.800]   Straining forward to what lies ahead pressing on toward the goal for the price of the upper call of God in Christ Jesus
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.580]   Now you've probably heard that passage many times
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.840]   Paul again
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   emphasizing his vigorous pursuit
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.260]   Forgetting what is behind pressing on toward what is ahead?
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:00.080]   Straining toward what is ahead? Right? So again, this is a guy who's writing this sitting in prison
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.340]   You know if anybody could relax he could be relaxed I mean he's sitting in prison and preaching the gospel
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.240]   But he never quits
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:17.320]   He's passionately pursuing but here's the point if you just look at that and say yes, let's do it. Let's go. Let's do it
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.840]   Right, you probably many of you are sitting here saying like I've done it. I've done it many times and now it's gotten old
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.800]   You know, I feel like basic training again
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   What is the goal of this? What is the purpose of this?
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:36.060]   Well Paul says and again the key to what Paul says here is in the previous thing that he says in Philippians 3 8 through 9
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.160]   Look, this is what he says
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.120]   Remember chapter 3 verse 12 begins by him saying not that I have already obtained it
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.560]   Not that I have been made perfect and I am now I am pressing on to make it my own
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   So what is it that he is pursuing to make it his own?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.360]   Philippians 3 8 9 he says indeed
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.240]   I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:07.160]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I may gain who?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.880]   Christ
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.680]   So in other word, what if Paul saying what is he pressing on toward? What is he straining toward?
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.720]   to know Christ
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.200]   His goal wasn't simply to live a right life his goal wasn't simply to have peace with other people
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.740]   His goal was that these are means to get to Christ to have deeper fellowship with Christ
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.020]   Why was he okay with being persecuted and suffering?
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.320]   Because he said through the suffering he can fellowship with this Christ
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:44.520]   That everything in the world became rubbish in light of knowing Jesus Christ
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.880]   see what
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.200]   Paul and what Jesus is calling us to do is not simply here. Here's how what you must jump
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.980]   Here's a standard of righteousness that if you're a Christian
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.480]   this is what you need to meet up to and we're trying so hard to jump through these hoops and
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:08.240]   Not realizing that what Christ is calling us to is to himself
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.760]   Is to himself
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.400]   Paul says again in 1st Corinthians 2 2 to 3
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:21.640]   Verse 2 for I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.780]   Why does he say that because it's Corinthians church in the church
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.920]   They became a Christian and all of a sudden now they're being divided
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.160]   they're allowing all kinds of sinfulness in the church and
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.800]   Paul says the reason why this is happening in the church because you forgot
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.680]   You forgot the foundation in which you stand which is Christ crucified
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.760]   You forgot what brings you together. It's Christ crucified
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.560]   You forgot the reason why we sacrifice it's Christ crucified
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.640]   So the moment Christ is not the head the moment that Christ is not your pursuit
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   You see Godness as a means to get something else
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.960]   And that's why this church was divided. That's why Paul says when I came to you
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.040]   I didn't come with persuasive words of wisdom, but in power
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.640]   So that your your faith would not rest on man's wisdom but on God's power so that you would see Christ through me
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:19.480]   That what I'm asking you to do is not to jump through hoops, but I'm calling you to Christ
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.840]   Again Paul describes in Colossians 2 1 through 4 his ministry
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.720]   He says for I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.440]   And for those that lay out to see and for all who have not seen me face to face
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.480]   So when Paul says he's laboring he's struggling for them. I mean, that's an understatement
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.000]   This guy was literally willing to die. I
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.360]   Mean, there's a guy who gets stoned to get dragged out of the city thinking he's dead walks right back up goes into the city
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   And he comes back and preaching the gospel
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:59.880]   He's shipwrecked. He's beaten. He's he's given lashes which most men would have died just even from one time
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   So when he says I struggle
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   That's an understatement
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.160]   He says I struggle. I want you to know how much I struggle for you that their hearts may be encouraged
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.640]   Being knit together in love to reach all the riches of the fullness of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:25.120]   See that he says I'm struggling all of this because I want you to know this is what I'm trying to establish
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.200]   What does he say so that you may know?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   the knowledge of God's mystery which is who which is Christ and
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.160]   Then he says in verse 3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.000]   Everything that we need is in Christ
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.960]   Everything that we want is in Christ everything that we covet in the world
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.240]   Thinking that if we have these things there would be more joy. I would feel more alive
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.820]   Everything that we have been deceived to think that is in the world. Jesus says it's in Christ all the mysteries
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.920]   Everything that you and I can possibly imagine everything that we've been this world has been deceived to pursue
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:11.400]   He says found in Christ. That's why Paul says I struggle with all the energy that he's given me that you may know this Christ
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.760]   Not only is he pursuing this Christ
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.840]   He's giving his life so that you may also come to know this Christ
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.920]   That's why Paul says in Philippians if you're asking me if I want to live or die, I want to die
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.600]   Because my pursuit is Christ if I die, I'm going to meet this Christ that I've been pursuing
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.480]   But the only reason why I will continue living is because I want you to know this Christ, too. I
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   Want you to see who this Christ is and I want you to come with me
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.880]   So as long as he keeps me here, I'm gonna take as many people as possible
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   That's how he describes his goal
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.760]   To find a life in Christ
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:58.680]   So if it pursuing righteousness is all anything other than pursuing Christ, it will become old it will become a tremendous burden
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.800]   Sooner or later you will give it up
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.520]   Because whatever you receive whatever honor you may get
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:12.440]   Whatever respect whatever position that you may get from pursuing righteousness in the end. It won't be enough
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:18.720]   It won't be enough for you to persevere. It won't be enough when you get persecuted
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.280]   It won't be enough when your friends and families and the church doesn't live up to what you desire
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   If our pursuit is anything other than Christ
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   You will be disappointed and you're just a you're just one event away from saying that's it
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.200]   That's why Paul says these are just means
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:45.120]   We pursue righteousness because these are things that brings us to Christ we pursue faith because faith connects us to Christ
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:52.480]   We pursue love because he first loved us. We pursue peace because we can only have peace when we are with Christ
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.200]   Why do we need to do this
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.940]   Christ is what we're pursuing. Why do we need to do this?
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.280]   Well in Ephesians 2 89 you guys know that verse very well for by grace you have been saved through faith
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.680]   It is not your own doing it is a gift of God not as a result of work so that no one may boast
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:20.260]   For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.360]   So what does he say? We've been saved by grace for what for good works?
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:32.020]   We were created for good works, you know, if we don't properly understand what good works is that Paul
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.800]   that Paul describes as a gift of God and
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.000]   If we're don't if we're not careful we could look at works as you know
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.800]   What isn't that the law and didn't didn't the law all the law did was burden people and bring them under the curse and make sin
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.560]   utterly sinful
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.600]   If you look at the Old Testament if you look at the fall of Adam and Eve when God created Adam and Eve did he say?
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.920]   You're created. I put my breath in you and I made you like us and now just just go
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.760]   Is that what happened?
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.060]   Because oftentimes we think of work and labor as something that came in after the fall
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.600]   No, that didn't happen. In fact, if you look at Genesis chapter 2
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:17.740]   When God created Adam and Eve, he said be fruitful and multiply and subdue the land. So before the fall they were working
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:23.340]   They were laboring. They were naming animals. They were they were cultivating the land
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.120]   But what happened after the fall was?
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.400]   Sin came in
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   It wasn't the work itself
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.560]   in fact
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.080]   Work itself actually causes us to to feel alive
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.380]   You know, I
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.660]   Would tell you you know, like I've had all kinds of jobs
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.060]   You know because I'm a I'm a pastor and you know, we don't come from a wealthy family
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.540]   So, you know, I've had to I've had to work in any minimum wage job
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.260]   I've had it at some point and I've had some bad jobs, you know
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.780]   I've had a job where I was cleaning toilets eight hours a day sometimes 12 hours if I wanted overtime
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.480]   You know from 8 to 2 sometimes 8 to 5 in the morning, but that was not my worst job
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.480]   You know, I had another job working at City of Belflower
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.140]   My job was to go into the sewer area where the water pipes and I had to clean that out to repaint the pipes
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:19.040]   So I was 30 feet under painting pipes that one summer for about four months full-time, but that was not my worst job
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.800]   You know, I got some I had some bad experiences, but that was not my worst job my worst job
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.560]   Why I dreaded going to work was I worked at a gas station in Norwalk?
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.240]   I think it was an Imperial in Norwalk. So many guys may know that area
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:39.000]   But there was a 76 gas station there and it was already dead by then. I don't even know if that exists anymore
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.760]   There are no customers. I mean this is you know now like because of the internet
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.120]   There's so much stuff going on at night at that time even a TV shut off around one at one o'clock
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:56.000]   There was no internet no phones, you know, just landline and they're literally I was little in this little room with a glass window and
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.280]   And I had to sit there and we had maybe two customers a day
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.600]   You know and the funny thing is I couldn't balance the balance
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.320]   I was always $10. I don't know where it went
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.880]   But anyway, it's a side story I
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:17.120]   Dreaded that job because I work from 11 to 7 in the morning full-time
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.160]   And this is while I was going to school to help pay for my tuition
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.480]   But literally from 11 to 6 o'clock. We had no customers
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.920]   You know and then and then right one transition that people would start to come but there were no six seven hours
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.880]   It was like prison
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   You know one time I literally read the book of Acts four times in one sitting. I had nothing to do
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.360]   I was in small group. My small group leader would give me a book and said, oh, you know
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.000]   We're gonna read this for the next month. I would have that read and next time I comes I read it
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.200]   Give me something, you know, literally seven hours. I was doing nothing
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.840]   I had that job for about six seven months and after about two months
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:59.320]   I just couldn't stand it anymore because every day I go in as a 12 o'clock. So choose 1205
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:05.480]   Six tomorrow, what am I gonna do for six hours? You know and every time a car would pull up I get excited
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   It's like oh shoot. He's gonna come. Oh shoot. He's not putting a quick acid, you know
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:16.360]   You think like doing nothing would be great initially. I thought I'd be awesome. I got no responsibility. No customer
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.480]   I got nothing to do but literally it's like being in prison
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.880]   Because I can't go out because I'm working, you know
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:30.000]   If that was the worst job was not all this other stuff because just seven hours to do nothing
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.960]   Sometimes we think that we became a Christian now, we're liberated. So therefore we do nothing
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:41.600]   We just enjoy a Christian Liberty means we're freed from the bondage of that now. I just do whatever I want
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.400]   That is not what the scripture talks about when he says is we've been liberated
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.720]   So we've been liberated for good works
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   What was tainted at the fall?
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.640]   God restores it
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   He restores us so that we may live a righteous life that God intended and we feel alive
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.960]   The scripture says that he came to give life and give this life abundantly when he tells us to come and follow me
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   He's asking us. Hey sacrifice to jump through these hoops. That's not what he's saying
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.560]   You've learned how to live in death where death reigned
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.380]   Now that you've met Christ come follow me and I will show you how to live
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:29.520]   That's what Christian sanctification is sanctification isn't jumping through hoops and try to appease this. Holy God. You can't appease this. Holy God
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:38.320]   What righteous deed can you possibly do to appease a holy holy holy God that is not what sanctification is
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.420]   Sanctification is Christ calling us to live
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.880]   Everything that you've learned since you were a child before you met Christ
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.960]   Was learned in the context of our enemy
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.760]   teaching us and
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.280]   Telling us and deceiving us to think that if you pursue these things if you have these things if you go here if you eat
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.520]   This if you if you have the proper people around you you will live
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.560]   But you lived long enough to know that all that does is bring more frustration
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.200]   You finish one bucket list you have to make another bucket list
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.160]   You eat of the bread that the world gives you you will go hungry again
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.740]   If you drink of the water that this world keeps telling you is what you need to drink. You will go hungry. Are you thirsty again?
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.080]   iPhone 6
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.520]   iPhone 7
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.280]   iPhone 8
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   iPhone 58 and
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.160]   Every time you're gonna be convinced. I need the next one
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.120]   That's the deception of this world
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.960]   That's why you look at all the I am statements of Christ
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.320]   He says you're coming from bread, but I am the bread
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   You think that the Messiah is gonna come and he's gonna bring the light. I am the light
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:57.160]   You're hoping to be received by these fake shepherds of Israel who's kicking you out of the synagogue. I am the door
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.120]   I am the shepherd you want me to come and raise your brother from the dead
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.920]   But I am the resurrection and the life
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.360]   You're looking to see where you ought to go where the truth is where the path is
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   He said I am the way and I am the truth and I am the life
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.920]   No one comes to the Father but through me you think you're saved because you're children of Moses
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.040]   But before Moses was says I am
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.840]   Good works
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.320]   Sanctification is a call to come to him
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:33.360]   We receive Christ and we've been given life and now he says I'm gonna teach you how to live this life
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:39.200]   you ever see anybody, you know, there are some of you guys who are gifted with singing and
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   It and when you sing
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.200]   You there you can see you shine
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.240]   Because that's how God created you. You have a
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:55.920]   Fantastic voice and when you sing you shine you feel alive. Not only do you feel alive?
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   We all benefit from this life
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.900]   When the scripture says that God has given us each individual gifts and we live the way God intended us to live
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   Pursuing righteousness faith love and peace and we feel alive
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:18.080]   The glory of God is reflected on us and we benefit God receives the glory and everyone else benefits as a result
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.120]   He's teaching us how to live
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.240]   It's not jumping through the hoops. It's not to appease this Holy God
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.680]   It's because our sins have been atoned for
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.760]   So now you are free to live
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.080]   And that's why he calls us to pursue righteousness
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   That's why he calls us to pursue faith
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.720]   to pursue love and
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.960]   to pursue peace
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:49.360]   Life is found in Christ in Christ alone. Well, how should we do this? He says
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:56.840]   Along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. You're not meant to be doing this by yourself
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.920]   In fact, if you look at the fall the very first thing that happens when Adam and Eve breaks God's command
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.000]   What's the first thing that they do?
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   They go into isolation
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.640]   They hide themselves in shame
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:15.080]   Loneliness must come in. I know you know if we survey the room how many of us feel lonely
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.800]   That came as a result of the fall
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   It came as a result of the fall
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.760]   God intended remember what he created everything. He said he created the earth. It was good. He created the heavens
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   He it was good. He created the light. It was good. He created Adam. It was good
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.360]   Except he looked at him in the second time. He said it was not good for him to be alone
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.600]   So he made a companion for him because he was not meant to be alone
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:46.680]   So the first thing that happens when the fall comes is that they are separated. They have to begin to hide from each other
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:54.760]   And so our life our Christian life was never meant to be lived by ourselves. In fact Hebrews 10 24 and 25
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:00.360]   Pulse or the author says and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good deed
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   Not neglecting to meet together as is a habit of some but encouraging what one another all the more as you see the day
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.520]   drawing near
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.360]   You're not supposed to live by yourself, you know
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.820]   And I know a lot of people if we did a survey and said what was the one that number one thing that you're looking
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.200]   For it'll say, you know good theology good preaching and fellowship
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:29.640]   So I think everybody knows how fellowship affects us. But here's the thing that we need you and I need to understand
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.400]   There's a difference between fellowship and friendship
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.520]   There's so many people are going from church to church looking for friendship
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:45.360]   Now the difference between friendship and fellowship is friendship only happens with certain people who have similar background, right?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.080]   You were educated the same way you are same economic status
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.480]   You have you're in the same similar age bracket
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.240]   And so you have friends because you have common experiences common background common language
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.600]   And so we want to connect with friends
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   see friendship
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:08.600]   I'm not saying it's always the case. You can have fellowship with friends, but sometimes you can have friends without having fellowship
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:15.000]   Right, you can have friends and say why I love that that guy or that girl because they never judge me
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.460]   No matter what you do. They never judge me. Well true fellowship requires that we speak the truth in love
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.740]   Because there's a clear goal. It's partnership
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.920]   Friendship will be perfectly content where we are
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:38.120]   But fellowship will provoke us on toward loving good deed because fellowship is a partnering together for something. There is a purpose for it
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:45.000]   It's not just so that I can be sued and I can somebody can can give me a sympathetic ear because life is hard
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.320]   Fellowship will provoke us
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.760]   Friendship only happens with people who are similar to us
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.440]   fellowship can happen
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.640]   with anyone who is in the context of pursuing Christ a
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.120]   13 year old a 70 year old who is passionately pursuing Christ
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.240]   We have fellowship because I can be provoked you don't have to be my age
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.680]   You don't have to have the same experience if you love Christ you're pursuing him
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.320]   You can be provoked by anybody of any age of any language
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.360]   But sometimes we get make we mix up the friendship with fellowship
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.040]   We're jumping from place to place group to group people to people looking for somebody to understand me
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.880]   but in reality what the Bible calls us is
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:39.760]   Fellowship and that's why he says not to just get together. It says along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.960]   What I want to encourage you guys this morning is to look for people
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.320]   Who is on the same path as you?
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.000]   Don't just don't do so I were in the same fellowship, but we're in the same Bible study
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.800]   But look for people who have pure heart and team up with them. It's a I what do we have in common?
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   You have Christ in common
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:08.760]   Is it all we write we're like bicycling we have that in common. Really? That's your connection not Christ
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.640]   We like rock climbing. So, you know, I have I can I have something to talk to you about this guy
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:20.200]   One go rock climbing really that's what you're gonna you're gonna bring you together, right? Because you like rock climbing
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:27.520]   If Christ isn't what brings you together, whatever else is bringing you together is gonna easily fall apart
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.600]   That we ought to run this race
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.200]   Together to provoke one another this ought to be a fellowship of people from all different backgrounds
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.120]   People would we would have normally sitting and have lunch together if it wasn't for Christ. That's the beauty of the church
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.200]   The beauty of the church are people from all age all background all culture
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.520]   Bringing us together when the outside world looks at it says why are those people together? How did they become friends?
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.200]   What could they possibly have in common? Why is that old guy with that young guy?
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.840]   You know, why are these people sitting together and calling each other brothers and sisters in Christ?
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:13.400]   And that was one of the best evidence of the power of the gospel in the early church was that you had slave owners and slaves
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   You had Pharisees and tax collectors
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.160]   You had Jews and Gentiles all in the same church
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:26.680]   And they called each other brothers and that's what called the outside church outside people to look at that isn't what is bringing them together
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:33.200]   It was Christ they were all pursuing Christ together
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:42.000]   Let me wrap up with this, you know a lot of times we talk about sanctification, you know again we have this mentality
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.720]   It's like oh, it's burdensome. It's a lot of sacrifice and life is hard enough as it is
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.080]   You know, I gave this illustration years ago, but it's been a while. So I'm gonna wrap up with this
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   You know how the birds got their wings
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.160]   Okay, some of you guys may know what I'm talking about because I've given it before
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:01.400]   How the birds got their wings and this is not in the Bible. Okay, so don't say hey
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.600]   We learned something new about the Bible today. It's not in the Bible. Okay
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:12.200]   A long long time ago. There are birds did not have wings. So if the imagine birds that didn't have wings, right?
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.440]   Imagine birds that didn't have wings if they didn't have they'd be pretty pathetic creatures. They're little tiny legs, you know
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.040]   I mean, they can't run. They're not fast. They don't have arms. They have this little beak. They can't protect themselves
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.880]   And so because they were pathetic creatures, they were used as servants in the jungle
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.080]   So the so the the monkeys would make them carry their bananas from tree to tree, right?
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   So that's all they were good for and then the angels were flying around and they looked at these birds and they had mercy on
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.240]   Them look at these animals. They're being abused. Let's do something about it. So one of the benevolent angels decided to
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.480]   Say hey, why don't we give them our wings?
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.300]   Then they could be come from a pathetic creature and they could they could fly
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.760]   Right, so they came and all these angels decided to sacrifice their wings and give it to these birds
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.660]   So when they first got the wings, they had no idea what this was
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.740]   They have the bananas in their back and they're running around the jungle and they're running into the trees, right?
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.940]   So what is this? This is a cruel joke
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.900]   right
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.860]   We're carrying the bananas and now we got to carry this burden too. Like who are these angels?
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:23.260]   You know and so they were running around and you know what the what the banana is like
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   So this is too much. So eventually they decided to get rid of their wings
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.440]   but some of them remembered
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:36.060]   Look at the angels remember what the angels were doing with these rings. Do you think that maybe they were flying?
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:41.580]   Maybe they were up in the air because of these wings and it was these wings that that caused them to be up there
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.740]   So some of them said you know what? Let's try it
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.300]   so some of the birds decided to go up on a hill and
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:54.620]   fly off and then they spread their wings and they began to fly and they no longer were carriers of bananas and
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.860]   The ones who continue to carry their bananas
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.620]   Eventually evolution took its course and then they died off. That's why they're not here
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:08.260]   So now these birds have become these majestic creatures, right
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.300]   So much of our Christian life
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.300]   He may be a silly childish story
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.140]   But so much of our Christian life because we don't understand what it is
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.500]   What we have in Christ
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:25.180]   We look at all the imperatives of scripture and all the challenges that we have and all we see is the blood of the cross
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.980]   All we see is sacrifice. All we see is pain
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.800]   They're carrying these bananas paying the bills
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:38.060]   Having a good marriage raising children is hard enough as it is and then we come to church and then we feel guilty
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.820]   I got to read the Bible. I got to pray
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:47.260]   I got a game I got a serve and on top of all the burdens of being a human being in this fallen world
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.860]   now I got to carry the extra burden of
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.740]   satisfying God and
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:59.580]   In this burden is too much to bear and so after a while you throw it off and say, you know what?
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.700]   My life is much easier
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.260]   before I met Christ
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.500]   But when we realize what Christ is calling us to is to life
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:15.560]   That the calling that he's given us imperatives the righteousness. These are all calls to come to him
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.220]   That he opened the gates to the throne of grace and he says now come with confidence
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   Not to appease the Holy God
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.860]   But because that's your Abba Father
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:31.420]   Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:37.020]   take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and I'm humble in heart and
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.980]   I will give rest for your soul for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:51.340]   Isaiah 40 31 it says they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings of eagles
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.900]   They shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.220]   so I pray with all my heart that our church would recognize the
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:07.220]   Prize that we have in Christ that Jesus came to give life and give life abundantly that all of scripture is
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.020]   A call to Christ and Christ himself
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:15.620]   Would you take a minute to come before the Lord and prayer with me as a worship team comes to lead us in praise?
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.300]   Again take a few minutes come to come before God and to pray Lord
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:26.540]   I've been trying so hard with my own strength to do this and to do that
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.940]   Not recognizing that you were calling me to you
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.260]   Lord I want to know you I
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.100]   Want to be intimate with you. I want to know this life that you promise
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.660]   And to take some time to come and pray before God
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:46.820]   That God's call this morning is to live and to live abundantly. Let's pray
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.980]   (gulping)
