[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   If you could turn with me to 1 Peter 1.13.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.520]   We're going to be just reading one verse.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.240]   I think, well, it took me a long time to come down to this one verse.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.280]   I was thinking of taking a bigger chunk of this text, and then I thought we'll just stick
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   here.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.520]   But in 1 Corinthians, as you kind of put yourself into the mentality of the church, this is
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.120]   kind of a dispersed church in a way.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.360]   It's the church is in Asia Minor.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.920]   There's a lot of persecution and suffering going on, especially under Roman rule, but
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.440]   it's been heightened because of the crucifixion of Jesus.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.120]   As Christianity is starting to explode, there's been a scattering of believers.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.160]   And with that, as people are immigrating into different locations, these are people who
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.320]   are struggling with many different temptations that come along with this.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.440]   And with that is where we find ourselves in 1 Peter 1.13.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.880]   It says here, "Therefore, prepare your minds for action.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.160]   Keep sober in spirit.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.360]   Christ."
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.120]   Now 1 Peter has been an epistle that's brought me personal problems in life.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   And the reason for that is because it's not commonplace for me to be persecuted or suffering
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.160]   like many of us here in Southern California where it's sunny and nice all the time.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.880]   This is something that we've talked about a lot.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.840]   This is something that we've kind of brought over and over again to the plate, especially
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320]   as Pastor Peter has gone into the book of Hebrews.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.160]   And as we think about this, we've grown very familiar with this concept.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   Drifting, heard that a lot lately.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.840]   This idea of comfort, this idea of maybe even the brevity of our own conviction, that we
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.760]   might be so convicted by a truth of God at one moment and then struggle to remember whatever
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.560]   that was later on.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.240]   Maybe many of us, even Sunday to Sunday, can leave a Sunday sermon thinking of grandiose
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.600]   things and then you realize, "Man, I'm hearing the same, like a similar thing again this
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.720]   week and yet it feels like from last week to this week, maybe there hasn't been much
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   of a change."
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.920]   We've grown very familiar with this.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.680]   We've grown familiar that we have a danger of loving the things of this world, of chasing
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.480]   after the pleasures that it offers to us.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.360]   It very much goes hand in hand with the apathy and jadedness that creeps up on our hearts.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.520]   And time and time again, we feel that disconnect, the conviction of faith, the pull of this
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   world.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.760]   Earlier on in my Christian walk, a verse I memorized and recited to myself frequently
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.520]   was Colossians chapter three verses one through four.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.000]   We don't have this one up for you, but it's that idea of set your eyes, set your mind,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.640]   fix your attention and your gaze upon the things of heaven where Christ is.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.720]   And the reason why I memorized that, not only memorized that, I actually used to write things
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.880]   on my arm, on my hand, because I kept forgetting what my life was about.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.600]   Many of us could kind of relate to it, maybe you didn't write all over your arm like I
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.560]   did, but for me, it was such a struggle.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.640]   It was not only difficult, but it was frustrating for me because I wanted to remember.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.840]   I wanted to know that day to day, my life is for the Lord, for his purposes, for his
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   attentions, for his kingdom, and not my own.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.160]   And in a way, it was very defeating for me.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.560]   And we can try so hard to remember, we can memorize verses, we can remain disciplined,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.600]   we can write all over your arm, but maybe this is hitting kind of a chord with some
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.720]   of you in seeing that disconnect.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.760]   And today we're going to be addressing this through chapter one, verse 13.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   And we're going to be going through three points to address this.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.440]   The first point is this, we're going to be looking at this command.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:40.240]   The command is for us to fix our hope completely, to fix your attention of hope completely,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.880]   wholly and totally.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   This is an imperative, this is an authoritative command given by God himself to us, and we'll
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   touch on that.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.400]   Secondly, we're going to be talking about the content of whatever that hope is.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.320]   So if the first one was the imperative to fix your hope completely, the second point
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.140]   is going to be what is that we are called to fix our attention of hope on.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.080]   And that is coming grace.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.880]   We're going to fix our hope on an approaching grace at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.280]   And thirdly, then we're going to answer a final question, how do we do this?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.500]   Those are our three points.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.900]   So first is the imperative, fix your hope completely.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.260]   This is the command to us.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.320]   And this passage in verse 13 begins with, "Therefore," in verses 1 through 12, if you
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.960]   even scan it there, what you're going to see is kind of the greatness of salvation.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.880]   You have been given a salvation that can never be taken away from you.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.060]   He calls it undefiled, unfading.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.360]   He says it's something that is going to be imperishable.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.720]   He said that this is that which you have been called into, a living hope.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   You've been given something great.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:07.920]   "Therefore," the command is, "fix your hope completely."
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   As we look at commands in Scripture, the authoritative command and a demand from an authoritative
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.380]   God himself, as we think and look upon that, we have to remind ourselves of the importance
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.260]   of a command given in Scripture.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.180]   If you're a member of Berean Community Church, this is a reminder of number two on the membership
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.180]   covenant that you signed.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.380]   There's 10 things that we sign, right?
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.380]   Or we look at.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.740]   Well, number two, the second one is this.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.760]   I confess that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God, which has, and here's what I wanted
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.800]   to kind of highlight, ultimate authority over my life.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.300]   That means when we read Scripture, it is authoritative into our lives.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.600]   That is what we sign off to as believers, that we say we surrender our will.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   We submit to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.680]   We say God is our everything, and we humbly submit and obey.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.360]   But if we treat it as optional on our day-to-day living, we have to spin this around again
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.700]   and remember it has ultimate authority over my life.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.320]   We have to think about it as if God himself speaks into us.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.780]   This is the command.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.420]   This is the imperative.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.740]   It is not optional.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.880]   The greater the weight of the person who gives the command, the greater the weight of urgency
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.600]   upon which we take it.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.400]   The weightier it gets, the heavier it gets for us.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.480]   Think about that a bit.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.080]   I bring up my kids a lot because at a young age, there's so much time and attention that
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.680]   needs to go on to them.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.280]   I do have a four-year-old daughter named Addie and a two-year-old son named Hudson.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:08.260]   Now as Hudson's been growing in awareness, like his brain has just been doing some crazy
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.420]   things lately, and his desires have begun to really show.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.440]   This is where you see human depravity at its peak.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.840]   You're like, "Whoa, it's just so raw."
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.360]   It's not hidden.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   It's just there.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   If you don't get it, what happens?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   You just cry.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   It's just that.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   There it is.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   Ugly sin.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.920]   Sinner and sinner just going at it.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.320]   So Addie and Hudson, here they are.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.280]   And these days, because he's been growing this in awareness and a desire, like I can
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.760]   say no to my sister.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.220]   Because that's been happening, what I hear a lot is a lot of shrieking.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   And usually it's shrieking from one side and it's shrieking from my daughter Addie.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.220]   And what I hear is, "No, Hudson.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.220]   Stop Hudson.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   Don't touch that Hudson."
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.780]   And now she's getting clever, so she's trying to figure out ways to manipulate him.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.860]   And so sometimes I hear in the middle of yelling, "Hudson, how about you play with this?"
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.360]   And things like that.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.780]   And then you see the clever ways in which these things come out.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.380]   But what you see about all of these things that Addie is kind of saying to her younger
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.460]   brother, "These are all commands.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.460]   Don't do it.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.020]   Leave me alone.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   Don't touch me."
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   That kind of stuff.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:17.400]   But what's been fascinating to see is as that's been happening, Hudson has been so disrespectful
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   to her.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.540]   It's almost humorous.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.040]   You look at it and he's so condescending.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   You can see it in his eyes.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.100]   Like, "Who are you?"
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.180]   There are times when she's all mad and he's just smiling.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.820]   And I'm like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.660]   That would drive me crazy."
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   Someone did that.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.740]   You're all riled up and yelling and the person's just smiling at you.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.780]   And he's really strong.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.980]   He's stronger than her.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.740]   So she can't do anything about it.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.780]   She can't pull it out of his hands.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:54.780]   And to the point where he will draw and lift his hands and he will even at points hit her.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.840]   This is his older sister and we're teaching him respect and yeah, he gets disciplined
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.740]   for these things.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.260]   But what's been interesting about this, to take it one step further, is his condescending
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.500]   attitude towards his sister.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.980]   The difference is when I come into play and I say something, it's immediate.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.420]   He just listens.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.580]   It has gotten to the...
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   It's kind of funny.
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.820]   Like, if I know how to do it now, if I use my words in a certain way, if I bring out
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.420]   a certain tone, I say, "Hudson!"
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   Like that, right?
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.420]   That's exactly how I say it.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   "Hudson!"
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.580]   I'm going to put an accent on the second part.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.180]   If I do that, he starts to cry.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.500]   All I said was his name, but he starts to cry.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:46.660]   But he perks up, he listens, he hears, and there's this gravitas and this weight that
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.100]   comes upon him where depending on the person who gives the command, it really changes in
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.740]   the way he reacts to it.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.700]   Now this is important.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.340]   The command is a command, right?
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.380]   If someone tells you to do something, you're going to be like, "I'm not going to listen
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.860]   to you," or you're going to be like, "Oh, yes sir."
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:14.060]   God gives a command here, and God is bringing commands throughout Scripture, right?
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.020]   What is your attitude before God?
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.340]   Honestly speaking, do you scoff?
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.340]   Do you hear God's word?
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:32.900]   Almighty God, when you hear His word, do you take some time to think, "Let me think about
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.940]   this whether I should obey it or not."
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:44.220]   When you think about what it is to obey Him, it's so clear.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.060]   Even with my kids, I know it.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.140]   Parents, you know this, right?
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.260]   Obey the first time.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.260]   You don't wait.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.260]   I'm not going to count down.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.740]   I say it, you obey.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.740]   That's how it works.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:06.100]   But for us, we sit there, and we contemplate, and we think, and we consider, and this is
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.740]   a command from Almighty God Himself into our lives.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.580]   Don't be mistaken.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:19.860]   Every imperative given to us in Scripture ought to be taken as if spoken from His mouth.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:28.940]   We commence, we listen, we obey because we have already surrendered ourselves to Him.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.300]   And here in His command spoken through Peter, He says, "Fix your hope."
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.300]   That's the command.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.980]   "Fix your hope."
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:44.300]   This is important for us in everyday life here in comfortable Southern California.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.980]   We're called to fix our hope.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.980]   And why do we start here?
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.260]   I wanted to show you this next part here.
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.380]   Okay, it's good.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.660]   So we have the bolded and the underlying part there.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.660]   Fix your hope.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.420]   Why do we start here and start, "Prepare your minds and keep sober," because those look
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.740]   kind of like commands too.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.660]   Well, I think in this instance, the ESV did a little bit better of a job of translating
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.580]   this, but clearly, "Fix your hope" is going to be the only imperative given in this verse,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.820]   the only command.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.940]   "Prepare your minds and keep sober" are actually called participles.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.220]   We're going to bring in a little bit of grammar.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.300]   Participles that kind of modify what it is to fix your hope.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.800]   It modifies the command.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.660]   And that's why we're starting here with the command, "Fix your hope."
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.300]   This imperative is actually just the one word.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.940]   It's just actually hope, but it has such emphasis to it that the translators had to add in a
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.160]   couple more words, "Fix your hope."
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.380]   But this understanding of hope, this biblical hope is very different than the hope that
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.220]   we know in life, just in everyday living.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.740]   This hope is to look forward with confidence.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.720]   This hope is to live in expectation.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.180]   This is the command to us that we should live in certainty of what's to come.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.940]   This isn't the weak type of hope that's based upon human desire, because our desires are
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.220]   weak and feeble.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:18.060]   This isn't the hope that I'm wishing for something, that I want something so bad that our hopes
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.280]   could be actually crushed.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.500]   This biblical hope, "Fix your hope" is different than that.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.180]   While I was writing this manuscript out for this sermon, my heart was filled with hope.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.180]   I'm sorry to bring this up.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.380]   I know it's fresh and raw, but just got manned in Kawhi Leonard.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.040]   And I really wanted him to come to the Lakers.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.340]   It was the right thing to do.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.340]   But he sinned.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.340]   And he went to the Clippers.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:51.420]   But anyway, upon writing it, I was thinking about it, and I was like, "Man, this is hope."
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.380]   But the hope I had is so different, because this hope was not only could it be crushed,
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.700]   but now that I'm standing here, I'm telling you directly, my hope was crushed.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.700]   I was crushed.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   It was taken away from me.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.420]   I don't want to talk about him anymore.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.420]   But the hope that's being talked about here is confident.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.340]   It's expectant.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.480]   It's not based on the one who does the hoping.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.740]   It's based on the one who offers us the promise of something that is certain to come into
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.260]   our lives.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.700]   It's hope that's based on trust and belief.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.580]   And just like with commands, depending on where the command comes from, will your response
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.700]   flow out, right?
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.900]   But same thing with hope.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.380]   Same thing with even trust and belief.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:43.500]   Trust and belief grows not upon an individual's ability to trust in something, but it actually
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.260]   grows based upon the measure of character, integrity, faithfulness, and worthiness of
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:54.260]   the person who is there as the object.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.380]   In other words, you could think about it kind of like a trust fall.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.260]   That's the thing where you do this, and someone says, "Fall, I'll catch you," and then you
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.000]   fall, right?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.220]   If there's a seven-year-old boy that comes and says, "Fall, I'll catch you," then what
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.060]   happens to your trust?
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.020]   It minimizes based upon what you see there, right?
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.900]   But as soon as you get a bigger guy, Garrett, right?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.060]   Garrett, Garrett Kleiser, he's like back there, and he's just saying, "Trust me, I'll catch
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.560]   you," and then you're going to be like, "Oh, okay, cool, I'll fall."
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.860]   That's what happens with us.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:32.820]   Our understanding and view of a great God is what's going to cause us to both obey the
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.420]   command of God, but also to trust and to hope in Him.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.660]   That's why the first vision statement here at our church is engaging in God-centered
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.140]   worship.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.680]   We don't generate worship in ourselves.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.300]   Worship generates off of a vision of God, off of a clarity of a picture of who God is,
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.340]   and all His exaltation and worth.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.900]   That's the beginning point.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.440]   And this is biblical hope.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:10.060]   Look at Him and fix your hope there.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.460]   It's confident, it's expected, it's waiting for something to take place rather than simply
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.880]   wishing.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.060]   We're not trusting in some ordinary person, we are trusting in the eternally faithful
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   God.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.880]   This is why these are reasonable things.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.260]   This command would be unreasonable.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.260]   Fix your hope.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.420]   How can you tell someone to hope like this?
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.140]   I could hope like I wanted Kawhi Leonard, but how can you tell someone to hope with
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.140]   this kind of confidence?
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.420]   Because this is who God is.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.260]   This is very reasonable.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.140]   Biblical hope therefore runs contrary to the way we use hope on a day-to-day basis.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.000]   And this happens because the word hope in humanity, in a way, it's polluted by sin.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.700]   That's why we're very unfamiliar with this concept of hope.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:58.080]   Because we live in a broken world where this kind of hope is foreign.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.440]   There's two things, firstly our hope is sinful.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.200]   As a sinful people who are doing the hoping, our hope is tainted with our sinful desires.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.040]   That's why worldly hope looks so different.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.360]   And secondly, we hope in things that will fail us.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.200]   And there's nothing in this world that will be able to kind of cash in on what it promises
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.420]   to us.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:22.240]   So our hope, when it's placed in God, it's never just desire, but it's expected.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.760]   I'll give you one quick example in scripture.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.120]   Romans chapter 4, verse 18 through 22, the story of Abraham.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.880]   It says, "In hope against hope he believed."
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.200]   You have to just sit there and go, "What is that?"
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.640]   "So that he might become a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.600]   So shall your descendants be.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.720]   Without becoming weak in faith, he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead," since
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.200]   he was about 100 years old, "and the deadness of Sarah's womb.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:55.240]   Yet with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.600]   in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what God had promised, he was
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   able also to perform.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.680]   Therefore it was also credit to him as righteousness."
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.400]   See, this is our faith.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.120]   This is our hope.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   In hope against hope.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.200]   That first hope is the biblical hope.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.560]   In hope against hope, which is kind of like the more worldly hope.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.840]   In hope against hope, he believed.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.280]   He trusted in the Lord fully, without wavering.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.880]   Which brings us to this adverb that we see.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.600]   The adverb is, can you guys pick it up?
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   It's completely.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.680]   "Fix your hope completely."
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.600]   Adverb modifies the verb.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.960]   If the verb was this command, "Fix your hope," it tells you how to do that, or how it ought
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   to look.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.920]   It's completely fix your hope.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.360]   It changes the whole tone and dynamics of that command to us.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   It's everything.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.520]   Wholly, unconditionally, totally, unwavering to the end.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.600]   Our hope isn't a half-hearted hope.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.280]   Because this level of hope isn't based upon our ability to hope, but this level of hope
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.320]   is based upon who God is in our lives.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.520]   If we're having trouble hoping in the things of God today, it's because our vision has
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.520]   been skewed.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.720]   Our eyes have been taken off of who God is and what He's like.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.800]   So when we place our faith in God, it's a total surrender.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.080]   This word completely is 100%.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.760]   There is no reserving of any hope.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:44.200]   You cannot say, "I will put 95% of my hope in the Lord, but 5% I hope in my finances,
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.360]   I hope in my career, I hope in a certain relationship, I hope in the pleasures that this world gives."
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.600]   Not even 1%.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.640]   Not even .001%.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   Not even .00001%.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.080]   This is saying complete hope in God and in God alone.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.720]   Because for the Christian, that is our hope.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.580]   There is no other hope in this world other than God.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.840]   Everything that we hope in in this world runs through who He is.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.920]   And any time we take our expected hope away from Him is when we will idolize things, when
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.240]   we will fall into the temptations, the pleasures of this world.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.160]   It's complete surrender to Him.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.320]   This brings us to our second point, which is this.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.360]   What exactly are we to fix our hope on according to Peter?
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.520]   Where do we practice this fixing of hope completely?
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.480]   It's on the coming grace at Christ's return.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.040]   Fix your hope on the coming grace at Christ's return.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.640]   It can't be generic.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.160]   You can't leave today and think that's your application.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.840]   I have to fix my hope on God.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.320]   Though that's true, if you stop there, that becomes a loophole upon which sin thrives.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.340]   And we'll get into this.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.140]   He's saying specifically think about where your hope is fixed here.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:22.740]   It's on this grace that is coming that will be fully realized when Jesus returns.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.940]   There is an aspect of our salvation, if you look at chapter 1 verse 13 again, when you
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.120]   look it's this fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.040]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.820]   There's an aspect of our salvation where it's not fully done.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:43.500]   Our salvation is at work and our salvation is yet to be completed.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.860]   You do have to be careful a little bit with that.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.700]   But this is to an audience of Christians who are suffering under persecution.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.820]   And they had need to fix hope because their hope was kind of, they needed relief from
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.640]   a cruel and unrelenting world for them.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.780]   So for us, in a place where there's comfort, in a place where persecution feels like something
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:08.260]   we have to kind of wiggle into to say that we're being persecuted, we are still called
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.620]   to heed this command to fix our hope on a coming grace.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.860]   And what is this coming grace?
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.660]   It's the completion of our salvation when we see Jesus.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.580]   We're going to go through a quick three things here in this.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.180]   This idea of justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.500]   Starting with justification.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.340]   When we think of salvation, many times our minds go back to this prior justification.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.700]   When we think of salvation, like what is salvation?
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.860]   We think of the time when God saved us.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.220]   So for me, it was 15 years ago before I entered into college.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.420]   And before I entered into college, it was a time, I knew exactly where I was sitting,
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.780]   I remember clearly when God opened my eyes to the glory of the gospel.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.140]   I remember it.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.420]   And so that was a time where we wouldn't just call it salvation though, we would be very
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.060]   specific about calling it justification.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.940]   Though it wouldn't be wrong to say that was when we were saved.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.820]   The idea of justification means declaration of righteousness.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.820]   That is that God declares us righteous, almost like in a courtroom.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:12.220]   When a judge says, "You are innocent," that's you are declared innocent.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:17.300]   It's just words that are spoken that becomes law.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.740]   In 2 Timothy 1, verse 8 through 9, you're going to see this.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.220]   This is always a past tense thing.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.180]   It says, "Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me, his prisoner,
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.540]   but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.300]   us and called us with the holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.580]   own purpose and grace, which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity."
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.820]   Now, there are times when justification is seen as present, but the idea of justification
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.420]   in and of itself is a past tense thing.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.980]   And we see it here in 2 Timothy.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.300]   He has saved us.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.800]   He has called us.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.280]   Justification was done in the past.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.340]   Justification of righteousness shows that God has forgiven us of all our sins completely,
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.660]   totally done.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.180]   We're promised heaven.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.340]   We're promised a place before God.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.000]   We're promised to be able to enter into his presence with confidence.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.700]   And then there's sanctification, which is the second part of salvation.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.340]   And we're going to see sanctification as a present day working out of salvation.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.780]   But this is also salvation.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.100]   In 1 Corinthians 1, verse 18, we see this, "For the word of the cross is foolishness
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:34.340]   to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.760]   This is the process where we're in our lives right now.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.900]   We are being saved.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.520]   We are being sanctified.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.900]   Though we were justified in the past, there's an element of our salvation that continues
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.440]   to work out in the day to day.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.540]   We're in the process of it, of being washed, of being purified by the Spirit.
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.620]   Even God's discipline is designed in sanctification.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.860]   That God's discipline is meant to bring us to repentance too.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.820]   Thirdly, there's glorification.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.620]   This third and final piece of salvation that needs to be addressed.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.260]   That is that our salvation is not yet fully realized.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.440]   It's not in completion yet until we reach glory.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.220]   We see this in Romans 5, verse 9, "Much more than having been justified by his blood, we
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.580]   shall be saved in the future from the wrath of God through him.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.980]   For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his son, much
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.960]   more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.940]   You look at these and you see, "We could run so quickly past the tenses."
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.140]   But you take a look and you're like, "Does that mean I'm not saved now?"
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.180]   It's because this is talking, in a sense, about glory.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.460]   To draw our attention back to 1 Peter 1, verse 13.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.900]   What is this one talking about?
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.860]   It's talking about glorification.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860]   It says, "Fix your hope completely on the grace that is to be brought to you at the
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:05.420]   revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:12.660]   This grace that he's talking about is actually salvation that will be completed one day.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.980]   See all three of these, justification, sanctification, glorification, they go hand in hand.
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   I'm going to go out on a limb and say, I think for many of us here, even though we know this
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.020]   theology, a lot of us are like, "Man, I know this justification, sanctification, glorification.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.300]   We've been here long enough.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.420]   We've studied scripture enough to understand these three concepts."
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.180]   I'm going to go out on a limb here and say, glorification might be the one we give the
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.220]   least attention to.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.940]   I think we understand it as a theology.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.820]   And we'll think about it in times when we're in trouble because we just want to be done
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.100]   and rid with this world.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:54.420]   But on a day-to-day living, as long as I'm satisfied here, glory is far from our minds.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:28:01.340]   Jesus' return is not urgent in our hearts.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.460]   We cling to the promise of declared righteousness and justification, and we understand that
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.420]   we're in the process of being sanctified, but we can't forget that we're not yet complete.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.300]   We're in a process.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.100]   We're going to get there.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:27.580]   But this is that hope that's being talked about here, this hope that drives us in this.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:35.180]   When we don't think upon glory, when we don't remember that we are still yet to be fully
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:42.860]   experiencing salvation as it was meant to be, you lose joy.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:50.780]   You lose expectancy of the coming reality, and we handicap ourselves in our sanctification.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.020]   It's very easy to grow legalistic in our thinking because we end up practically just trying
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.780]   to run hard.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:07.020]   Our view becomes so set upon how I'm doing spiritually rather than on the reality of
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:15.220]   God, who He is, yes, what He's done, but also that He is coming in Christ.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:21.260]   We lose an engine in our life.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.940]   I forget who gave me this picture.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.420]   I was trying to remember, but it was a professor.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.180]   There are these things called maglev trains.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.260]   I think it means magnetic levitation trains or something like that.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.500]   Some of you guys, engineers, might know.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.980]   I was looking at this.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.260]   It's run by magnets, and they shoot this electric current through it.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.060]   Magnets if you have an elementary understanding of it, when you put opposite poles together,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.420]   what happens?
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.980]   They pull into each other.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:55.100]   When you put the same poles next to each other, they generally repel each other.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:00.140]   These maglev trains, how it works is it was a newer technology at the time.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.100]   They would have this train that would sit upon these two poles, an upper and a lower
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   pole.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.700]   That's how the train would move.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   One would push, one would pull, and then this train would fly.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.100]   But it would do it by levitating right in the middle because of the magnet.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.540]   It would just shoot.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.900]   Everyone was like, "Whoa, this is so crazy.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.940]   Look how fast this thing goes."
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.220]   This professor, he was saying this is kind of how he views justification, sanctification,
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.500]   and glorification.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.540]   You lose any one piece of this in understanding salvation, and you will not be able to go
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.180]   in Christian life.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:40.080]   There's an aspect of justification that pushes you towards, and then there's an aspect of
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.060]   glory that's going to pull you towards, and then there's this understanding of sanctification
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.420]   where you fly right in the middle.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:55.860]   We need to have a clear anchor in justification, but we need to also remember that we're yet
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.740]   an unfinished work.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.020]   Those who latch too tightly onto justification is at risk at abusing grace and living licentiously.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   I've been saved.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.020]   Cool.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.700]   Those who simply think about sanctification as at risk of getting stuck on working for
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:20.060]   salvation, that we are solely responsible for the transformation of our hearts rather
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.620]   than the monergistic work that salvation truly is, even in sanctification.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.980]   And those who think about glorification will end up just floating, just sitting there,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.140]   biding their time, waiting for the end to come.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.540]   All three are vital.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.980]   I look at three quick texts.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.740]   Philippians chapter three, verse nine.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.660]   All three of these texts I'm going to bring up, we're not able to divide it up here, but
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.020]   I'll just try to kind of show you where it falls.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.820]   We're going to be seeing all three aspects in these three passages.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.380]   Philippians 3, 9-11, Paul says, "And may be found in him, not having a righteousness of
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.280]   my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.900]   which comes from God on the basis of faith."
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.580]   That verse nine there is justification.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.620]   He's saying, "I don't have a righteousness of my own from the law.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.480]   It comes from Christ.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.960]   The righteousness that comes from God, it's given to me.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.780]   It has been declared upon my life.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.220]   It is not something I deserve.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.020]   It is not something I've earned."
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.980]   But look at verse 10, "That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.300]   fellowship of his sufferings."
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   This is the day to day.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.900]   This is sanctification.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:32.100]   And then, you see, "Being conformed to his death," in verse 11, "in order that I may
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.020]   attain to the resurrection from the dead."
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.020]   Where he is looking towards glory.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.820]   That's why the passage right after this, he says things like, "Taking my eyes off of things
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.620]   that lie behind and going forward to things that lie ahead."
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.260]   This is the understanding of it, that he is moving in his Christian life.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.220]   He has seen, he remembers his past and he doesn't forget it.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.840]   He remembers it and drives him.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.740]   But there is a resurrection that's coming.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.420]   Titus chapter 2, verse 11, "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   all men."
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.340]   That part, there it is again, justification.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.340]   Grace has appeared.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.340]   It brought salvation.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.460]   And then, verse 12, "Instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.900]   sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present age."
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   That's sanctification.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.940]   That is here in the present day we are called to live godly.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   And then, verse 13, "Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.700]   great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, who gave himself for us to redeem us from every lawless
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.940]   deed and to purify for himself the people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds."
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:39.060]   And verse 13, there, "Looking for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of Jesus."
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.980]   That is the future thing.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:47.140]   Colossians chapter 3, the one I wrote all over my arm, "Therefore, if you have been
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.340]   raised up with Christ," that is justification.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.340]   You have been saved.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.340]   You have been raised.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.340]   You have been called a child of God.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:59.340]   And then, "Keep seeking the things above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.180]   Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth."
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.180]   That is sanctification.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:08.140]   That here then, since you have been saved from this, since you have been saved from
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.420]   sin, he's saying, "Keep seeking those things.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.180]   Keep setting your minds on those things."
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.260]   And then in verse 4, "When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.620]   be revealed with him in glory."
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.620]   There's always this aspect of glory.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.900]   In each of these passages, we see all throughout work, but in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 13, in
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.940]   our passage today, which one is that?
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.780]   It's the glory portion.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.260]   That is where he is saying, "Fix your hope."
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.520]   There's actually no need to fix a real hope on our justification.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.500]   It's promised to us and we have it.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.500]   We have it now.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   Justification, it gives you confidence and assurance.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.540]   But glory is yet to come.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.620]   This is the command.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:10.860]   Fix your hope completely on this grace that is on its way, that is coming.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:21.220]   Fix your hope on everything that happens when Jesus comes.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:27.980]   When we get to go home, fix hope there.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:39.420]   Think of that day when you'll be free from sin.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.540]   It can't be a passing thought.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:50.380]   We're so hard at work here, trying to live a life that is honoring and glorifying to
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:59.300]   God, but our eyes have to be fixed on coming salvation too.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.020]   We will be saved.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.620]   No more sin.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:11.260]   We're going to see our Savior face to face in a place where we will be able to worship
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:20.260]   and glorify and exalt God to our heart's content without restriction.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:25.960]   In 1 Corinthians 13, verse 12, interestingly at the end of this understanding of love,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.340]   it says, "For now we see in the mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.700]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known."
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:40.100]   That there is an aspect where one day, right now, we exist in a kind of dimness.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:47.020]   He says, "Face to face, we will see Him and we will know completely and fully."
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.640]   In 1 Peter, before verse 13, there is this understanding of, "Man, there's this God
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.960]   that is invisible to us, but we love Him and it's done with joy and expressible."
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.620]   Even though we live in dimness, because of the confident expectation of the fact that
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.500]   He's going to come and He's going to take me from this world, this broken, rotten, wicked,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.300]   vile world, and even my own heart, the wickedness and sinfulness that I see in my own heart,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:23.540]   that God will rescue me from this, that it will drive me towards eternity.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.220]   We need to keep our eyes locked on coming grace, that Jesus is going to return, and
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:35.140]   on that day, we're going to see the clear result of our sin, the recompense of it, the
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.380]   wrath that it deserves.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.980]   We're going to see it.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.700]   We're not going to be going into the theology of where we're going to be.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.260]   Are we going to be here when Jesus comes?
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   Are we going to be coming down?
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:51.700]   We're not going to talk about that today, but what we are going to see is judgment against
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   sin.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:58.820]   The sin that we wrestle with today, we're going to see what it deserves.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:04.300]   The sin that we're so tempted to take so flippantly in our sanctification sometimes.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.240]   The ones that we shrug off and say, "I'll just try better next week."
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:15.340]   We will see as revelation shows that the full recompense of it will be doled out.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.680]   You know what's going to happen?
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.740]   We as believers, we are going to worship, and we are going to praise the Lord with all
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.360]   of our heart, and we are going to sit there, and we are going to fall, and we are going
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.420]   to praise him, and we are going to weep because of the goodness of our God who has saved us
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.980]   from his very own judgment.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   He has forgiven us of sin, and we see what our sin deserves.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.180]   He has forgiven it, and we remember Jesus, the one we follow.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.900]   We see now him face to face.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.380]   He has the scars that he still bears on his hands and feet.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:57.860]   He's still, he's going to be there, and we're going to see all of it.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.060]   On that day when he returns, it's going to be glorious for us.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:07.620]   We're going to be done again with this broken world, the ugliness that resides around.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.900]   Our salvation is going to be complete.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.020]   Eternal life is going to be forever with God.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.940]   Everything the way it was meant to be.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.420]   Fix your hope completely on grace that is coming.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.140]   Don't take your eyes off of it.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.700]   Look to that day.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:30.060]   In 1 Corinthians 16.22, I'm not sure why the NESB didn't translate it, but we'll just pull
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.540]   out one word, "Maranatha."
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.300]   It means, "Come, Lord."
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.500]   "Come, Lord."
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.700]   That is every Christian.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.660]   "Come, Lord."
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.060]   Revelation 22.20, "He who testifies to these things says," and this is the very end of
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.060]   our scripture.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.940]   It closes with these words, "Yes, I'm coming quickly."
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.940]   And then John responds, "Amen.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.700]   Come Lord Jesus."
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.000]   This is us.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.900]   As we anticipate glory, we ought to be waking up every morning.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:08.060]   I know this is hard, but we ought to be waking up every morning saying, "Come, Lord."
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.340]   There's a missionary in the Philippines that everywhere we would go, as soon as we got
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.220]   to that place, he would just whisper under his breath, "Thank you, Jesus.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.220]   Come, Jesus."
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.980]   He didn't do it for show.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.500]   This idea of come.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:30.540]   Not when you're in the middle of finals, not when you're in financial difficulty, not when
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.380]   there's something difficult going on in your life in general.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.100]   This is every single day, every single moment.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:41.940]   And our sin actually helps in this.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.060]   As we not only see brokenness outside in this world, we see it in our very own hearts.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.420]   And it drives us.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:53.140]   As we see sin, and we say, "God, save us."
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.980]   We are still able to sing the words, "Hosanna."
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.660]   Don't close your eyes.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.140]   Do you sense your sin?
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.660]   Do you sense the evil around you?
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.980]   Do you feel the brokenness of this world?
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:12.100]   This world that causes us to make this comfortable Southern California thing happen, which is
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.580]   that everything is okay.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:26.500]   Not just knowing it, but have we bought into it that our hearts are drawn into these things.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.940]   Don't take your eyes away from your own sin.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.460]   Don't take your eyes away from brokenness.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   Look at it.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.160]   Stare at it.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.820]   And then your heart just seeks out a savior.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.300]   It drives us.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.660]   Don't let the world pull the wool down over your eyes.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.180]   There's a war going on around us.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.060]   The enemy prowls.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.060]   And if you read through 1 Peter, you're going to see it.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.300]   1 Peter, by the way, is just a bunch of imperatives.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.580]   A lot of commands.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.300]   You know, Paul does a good job going indicative, imperative, indicative, imperative stuff.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.060]   Peter, though he has a lot of places where he just kind of takes a little bit of a respite,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.580]   a lot of it is actually just imperative.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   So in...
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.420]   Did I jump ahead?
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   I totally jumped ahead.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.220]   Let's go back to that.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.020]   So let's go to our third point then as we head into that.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.620]   How do we then fix our hope on the coming grace at Christ's return?
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.920]   Now we're going to come across those two participles I was talking about.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:31.460]   As we think about, like, if this is the imperative, these participles help us understand how to
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.460]   live out the imperative.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:38.820]   Now, I don't want to detract away your confidence in the scripture that you have, but again,
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.000]   I do think that the ESV did a better job of this.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.020]   In that, in this understanding of prepare your minds for actions and keep sober in spirit,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.020]   I do think those are ING verbs.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.740]   Preparing your minds for action, keeping sober in spirit, fix your hope.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:00.420]   I think this is how it works.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.100]   So that first one there is by preparing our minds for action.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.560]   That's how you fix your hope.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.180]   Because here's the imperative, again, don't leave saying, "I need to fix my hope on Christ."
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.560]   You do that and you will fail this week.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.540]   This tells you how to do it.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.660]   Scripture will inform you as to how to do it.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.780]   We can't live in the general.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.080]   We have to look and we say, "Okay, how do we do this?"
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.280]   By preparing our minds for action.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.060]   Literally it means gird the loins of your mind.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.740]   And the idea behind this is found during the time of writing, which is that they wore these
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:34.740]   long ropes and if they ever had to move hastily or quickly, which was very not honorable thing
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.560]   to do, unless you were in war.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.140]   And in war, what girding the loins would be, they would gather up the ropes because it's
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.620]   so long and they would tie it, they kind of knot it up and cinch it up at the waist a
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.060]   little bit here and then they pull this belt around it and tie it in place so that they
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.580]   wouldn't be hindered in war.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.060]   That's the understanding of this.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.060]   And Peter says this here.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.020]   He says, "Gird the loins of your mind.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.500]   Prepare your minds in this way.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.500]   Prepare for battle.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   Be alert.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.220]   Get ready to fight."
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:09.020]   And this is how you fix your hope on the grace of Christ's return.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.020]   We'll cover that again.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.780]   And secondly, it's keeping sober in spirit.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.360]   How do you fix your hope?
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.340]   How do you heed this command?
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.540]   Stay sober.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.260]   Be sober.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.860]   Nevermore than when I came here to Berean did I hear that word, that we pray this so
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.640]   much, but rightly so.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.420]   Be fully alert.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.260]   Be fully aware.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.900]   Be in control of your thought processes.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.300]   Be self-controlled in your desires.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.420]   Be stable.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.940]   Retain your faculties.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Preach to yourself.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.900]   Do not listen to yourself.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.580]   When you think of self-control, self-control isn't something you just lob at places in
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.580]   your life.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.340]   You say, "Oh, I'm starting to get a pot belly.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.300]   For the first time in my life, I'm getting a little bit of a love handle here."
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.420]   You look at it and go, "Man, I'm going to be more self-controlled in my eating habits."
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.500]   Or "We'll throw self-control at our, like, we've got to exercise."
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.100]   Or "We'll throw self-control like, man, I just haven't been sleeping well."
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.980]   That's not how self-control works for the Christian.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.060]   It is a fruit of the Spirit.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.100]   That is that the Christian is a person of self-control.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:18.560]   Therefore, in our day, everything falls under this self-control.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.620]   That is what it is to be sober in spirit, that we are driving our bodies.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.940]   As a pilot, we kind of drive a plane, we are driving ourselves.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.620]   Because we understand that we still reside in the flesh.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:39.460]   But our soul, our spirit has been resurrected and we love God and we have to tell ourselves
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.820]   what it is that we're going to follow.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.940]   You wake up and you point to yourself and you say, "Uh-uh, I'm not going to listen to
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   you.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.940]   You're going to listen to me."
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.260]   That's what you tell yourself.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.820]   The opposite of sober is what?
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.820]   Drunk.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.500]   Don't be drunk.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.500]   Don't live in dissipation.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.700]   Another helpful way to apply things into your life is take the negative spin.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.620]   If it says, "Be sober," then think, "How am I being drunk?"
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.500]   That's a common way you can apply scripture into your life.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.060]   What's causing in me insobriety?
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.020]   What's causing in me a drunkenness?
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.860]   Take stock of your life right now.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.500]   What is causing drunkenness in your life?
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:33.380]   Where in your life are you not preparing your minds for battle?
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.100]   What's causing you to lose control over yourself?
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.460]   To not be prepared for the war that we know is raging all around us.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.940]   Here we go, 1 Peter.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.980]   Here are some of the imperatives that are found in 1 Peter.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.700]   In chapter 2, verse 11, it says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:55.060]   from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul."
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.540]   It says, "Abstain from it actively."
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.300]   There is a war waging against the soul.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.940]   In 1 Peter chapter 4, verse 1, "Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.260]   yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.140]   from sin, so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh, no longer for the lust of men,
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.420]   but for the will of God."
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.820]   It says, "Arm yourself."
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.980]   This is military language.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.620]   Equip yourself.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.580]   Don't live the rest of the time in your life.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.340]   As soon as you become a believer, until the day you die, you no longer live for the flesh.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.860]   All of us, for every believer here, that's what we say.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.540]   We no longer live for the flesh.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.860]   So you look, where am I living for the flesh?
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.860]   Stop living for it.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:45.340]   1 Peter chapter 4, verse 7, "The end of all things is near.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.260]   Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.340]   It's saying, be sober in spirit.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.280]   Have sound judgment.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.900]   When you judge your life, when you take stock of your life, let it be sound, not ridiculous
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   sounding as a Christian.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.380]   As a Christian, why would I be doing that?
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.300]   1 Peter chapter 5, verse 8 through 9, "Be of sober spirit.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   Be on the alert.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.380]   Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.500]   but resistant, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.180]   being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world."
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.180]   Be sober.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.700]   Be alert.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.560]   What is causing in your life today?
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.120]   This is what I had to ask myself this past week.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.120]   Man, what's causing me drunkenness?
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.820]   What's causing in me this thing where I say, "Man, boy, do I really wish I didn't live
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   in sin anymore?"
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.240]   You know, that kind of thing?
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:39.580]   Rather than that, what can I do to really attack that?
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.760]   This is where application comes in and our closing.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.140]   The command is this, to fix your hope completely on the grace that's coming.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.560]   That can't be your application in and of itself, right?
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.840]   It's just hope.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:49:00.380]   But he describes, "Prepare yourself.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.380]   Be sober."
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:07.720]   What's causing you to not be alert?
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.320]   What's causing you to fall into idolatry?
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.360]   What's causing you to love the things of this world?
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.920]   What's causing you to even fall into constant temptation?
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.660]   You feel like, "I could go up against this most of the time."
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.940]   But even for those moments that you know of weakness, what's causing?
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.360]   What are those places in your life?
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:32.100]   And these things need to be fully banished from your life.
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.520]   Is it entertainment?
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.240]   Is it a certain relationship?
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.000]   Is it a pursuit of some career?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.280]   Is it simply an attitude that needs to change?
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   Here's the two applications.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:50.680]   First, take a look at your life and see what needs to be cut out.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.360]   My recommendation to you when you do application is write it down.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:59.040]   The reason why I recommend that is because we leave with good intentions and then we
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.200]   are a fleshly weak spirit.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.680]   A spirit is willing, flesh is weak.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.200]   It's that kind of thing.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   We have all these good desires and I know every Sunday we go out, we're like, "Let's
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   go get this."
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   Right?
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.040]   But write it down.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.920]   I would put it in a place where you can see.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   I recommend bathroom, mirror, somewhere out there.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   But take stock of your life and cut out things that need to be cut out.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.600]   And be drastic about it.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.440]   Jesus says, "If something causes you to sin, and specifically here impurity, just cut off
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.720]   your hand, gouge out your eye."
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.640]   You're like, "Oh, he doesn't really mean that.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.960]   We're all going to be like one-eyed, one-handed people."
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.600]   But then we go the opposite way and we go like, "Well, I'll just try my best."
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:48.200]   He's saying go the lengths necessary to get to that point.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.120]   So you have to take stock of your life and seeing where is this happening, where is in
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   sobriety happening.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.880]   And what I would say is, "Whoop, cut it out."
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.200]   Meaning next week if someone were to ask you, "What'd you cut out?"
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   You're like, "Oh, I cut this out and this out."
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.000]   I was thinking about this and trying my best here not to sound too legalistic because we're
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.040]   not going to sit here and say like, "Cut out Netflix, cut out YouTube, cut out the Dodgers,"
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.800]   you know, that kind of thing.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.600]   I'm not going to cut out my Dodgers, you know.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:19.520]   But there are things in our lives that if it's causing it, and God is saying, "Fix
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.240]   your hope," as an imperative to us by doing this and this.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.960]   We sit here and we think, "This is how I'm going to do it."
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.080]   And then you go home and we do it.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.520]   I love that song, "Trust and Obey," where there's no other way to be happy in Jesus
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.520]   but to trust and obey.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   I love that.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   Trust, obey.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.600]   "Okay, okay, God.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   I'll do it."
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.600]   I love it when Addy and Hudson do that.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.760]   I say, "Do this," and they just do it.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.160]   You know, it's good for you.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.680]   Secondly, though, and this will cover all the other bases, take a look at your life
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.440]   and see what needs to be changed.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.440]   You can't cut everything out.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   I understand that.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.160]   We're not going to become Amish people.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.120]   And it's okay to participate in entertainment and the joys that this world has, and we can
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.680]   worship and revel in it.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.800]   But go home and change what needs to be changed.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.000]   Write those things down, make sure that you look different tomorrow, make sure that you
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.920]   look different on Wednesday, on Friday, on Saturday, and then on Sunday next week, make
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.520]   sure you look, maybe you're able to look back at the application and see, "How well did
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.320]   I heed God's command this week?"
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.240]   We have to apply.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.920]   Faith without works is dead.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.080]   Don't be just a hearer but a doer.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.560]   We got to do the work of this, but to close.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.160]   All of this needs to be done with an understanding of the great imperative today.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:42.360]   Make sure hope on coming grace, that Jesus died for our sins, he is at work within us,
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.920]   but he is yet to come.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.340]   And one day we're going to get there.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.600]   And I hope, maybe perhaps, some of us can be near each other when we see Jesus for the
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   first time.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.520]   That's going to be a cool thing, right?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.480]   I hope I get to see someone like your faces as you see Jesus for the first time, and just
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.360]   see what happens.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   He's coming.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.520]   We have to remember that and not live for the things of this world.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.920]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
