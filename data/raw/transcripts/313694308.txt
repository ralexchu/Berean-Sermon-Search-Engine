[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   So please turn there, chapter one.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.400]   As you guys are well aware, our Bible study during the midweek, we're going over the book
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   of Colossians.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.320]   Our youth group is going over Colossians as well.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.240]   And so I'm going to be doing just a theme of the fact that if we have Jesus Christ,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.420]   the high king, who is to us then our highest riches, then our hearts should be overflowing
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.340]   with thankfulness.
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.000]   And so with that said, let's take a moment to go before the Lord and then we'll dive
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   into the passage.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.200]   God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.920]   Lord, we thank you so much that you reveal to us your truth and all the more, God, that
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.200]   you continue to extend your love through your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.900]   And we also thank you that you involve us in your plan, that God, you would call us
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.140]   to carry the message and God, that you would continue to fill our hearts and our lives,
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.740]   Lord, that we would overflow to the people around us.
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.300]   I pray, Father, God, that we would fulfill this design, Lord, that we ourselves would
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.020]   be so enamored with the love of Christ and God, that our gratitude would go forth to
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020]   others.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020]   We thank you.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.020]   Amen.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   Okay.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.900]   If you could keep your finger there on Colossians chapter one, I want to introduce the topic
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.940]   and introduce, go into the passage with an interesting catchphrase.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.060]   This catchphrase is from a movie that was produced a long time ago, back in 1976, from
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.860]   a movie called The Network.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.220]   And once I say it, you might be like, "Oh, even though the movie's old, I know what you
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.620]   mean because many people have said it in the past."
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.620]   It's a quote.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.580]   It sounds a little horrible, so I'm only going to say it once.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.220]   And the quote is this angry man saying, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore."
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.980]   You guys remember that catchphrase?
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.300]   Some of you will remember it.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.300]   Many people have said it.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.380]   Now, the reason why I bring this up is because it's actually been floating on lots of different
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.700]   news circles, whether it be BBC, whether it be New York Post saying that this long-ago
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.140]   40-year-old movie has actually encapsulated how we feel right now.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.540]   And so what's really interesting is that I found it because I was just perusing and it
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.900]   came up.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.780]   And then once I started looking at the video, I realized maybe this guy was actually onto
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.780]   something.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.780]   I found the script.
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.260]   I'm going to read for you just a portion of it.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.740]   He says, "I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.020]   Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.140]   It's a depression.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.500]   Everybody's out of work or scared or losing their job.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.180]   The dollar buys and Nickelsworth banks are going bust.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.900]   Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter."
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.700]   It's horrible.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.460]   The guys are running wild in the streets and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.460]   what to do.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.580]   There's no end to it.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.640]   We know that air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   We sit just watching our TVs while the local newscasters tell us today that there's been
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.300]   homicides and so many violent crimes.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.060]   And if that's the way it's supposed to be, we know things are bad, it's worse, it's crazy.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.340]   And everywhere, everything is crazy.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.060]   We don't even go out anymore.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.580]   We sit in this lousy house.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.340]   And then he says, "I don't want you to riot.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.900]   I don't want you to go write to your politician because I don't even know what to tell you
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.900]   to write.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.420]   I just want you to be mad.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.540]   Stand up, open your doors, go into the street and tell them, 'I'm mad.'"
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.580]   And then it's really, really riveting.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.020]   And all of a sudden you see the TV screen and the shots and the video go to the streets
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.220]   of Atlanta, New York, California, and the people are busting open their windows in the
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.140]   middle of the night saying, "I'm mad.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.180]   I'm not gonna take it anymore."
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   Now what's funny about this is that the comments underneath, and I wasted my time the other
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.140]   day looking at this.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.180]   I was starting to read the comments.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.460]   And here now, many people sympathize with that kind of statement.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.900]   And there are all these individuals saying, "Oh, so relevant.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.260]   It's the feels right now."
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.660]   And then there are other people who are trolling or whatnot.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.660]   And what's really interesting is that this was then shared on lots of different blog
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.780]   posts.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.500]   And I Googled kind of a funny thing, which is angry blogs, because there are so many
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.540]   people ranting and venting.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.620]   Did you know that there is a angry black man's blog and there's an angry black woman's blog
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.220]   and there's also angry white man and white woman, and there's also an angry Asian man's
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.420]   blog, which this video is where I got the fling from.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.500]   To me, all that says is people have this sentiment.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.100]   The thing is, the danger to us is as we hear the news, as we see the blogs, and as we read
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.700]   these articles and all this kind of stuff, you and I could then share the sentiment.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.340]   The world has a voice and that voice can come into us and then it'll go through us and we'll
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.500]   say something to that same extent.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.200]   This world is horrible, right?
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.620]   But we have to take a moment to stop as believers.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.980]   And the thing about it is just as people trying to be wise, we have to take a moment to stop.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.780]   Because we ask the question, is this the right sentiment to have?
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.860]   And if we actually took a step back and put ourselves in the shoes of other people in
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.620]   this world, would they be like, "Yeah, I agree with you."
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.820]   Or for example, would some of the people who are desperately trying to get into this country
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.220]   look at it and say, "What is wrong with you?
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.140]   Why are you so thankless?
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.780]   Why are you so angry?
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.380]   I'm literally risking my life to sit where you sit watching your TV.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   I'm literally risking my family's life to work where you work and to walk the streets
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.380]   that you walk."
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.020]   You crazy people, right?
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.540]   And the thing about it is, yes, if we did open our windows and scream into the air,
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.540]   I'm just mad.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.620]   I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.500]   The spiritual truth is, we're not just speaking into the air because God hears.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.340]   And if God were to hear us and also to see the sentiment of our hearts, would he also
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.660]   look and say, "You crazy people, why are you so thankless?
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.900]   You don't realize what you have?
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.140]   You don't realize your privilege?
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.180]   You don't realize the grace?"
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.220]   You see, right now there is such an atmosphere of anger, disgruntled, complaining and grumbling,
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.140]   grievance feeling.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.980]   We have to be incredibly cautious because then we can buy into the voice of the world
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.420]   and then we can look crazy.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.580]   So the challenge today is that from the book of Colossians and the rest of the New Testament,
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.660]   God desires for us to walk in a manner that's worthy of God.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.740]   And in that walk, what we're going to have is an overflowing thankfulness.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.020]   Let's take a look at the verse that I asked you to turn to, Colossians 1 verses 9 through
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.020]   12.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.900]   We studied it this past week, but we want to take a moment to revisit and go through
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.700]   systematically several passages in the book of Colossians as a theme.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.180]   So we take a look and this is what the passage says.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.020]   For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.900]   and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will and all spiritual wisdom
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.520]   and understanding so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please him
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.860]   in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.860]   Strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for the attaining of all
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.720]   steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.940]   to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:09.940]   So as we take a moment to think about this, this passage is very clear.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.260]   Apostle Paul is praying and striving so that first we would have a knowledge of God's will,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.340]   that we would have a filling and understanding.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:26.980]   But what that's supposed to produce is a walk in our lives that's worthy of God.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:34.300]   The challenge for us is not to simply have eyes to see all that's corrupt with the world
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.140]   because that's already been actually told to us.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.660]   It's not wrong for us to see the things that are problematic, the things that are unjust,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:48.260]   but rather within the context of a broken and fallen world to walk in a manner that's
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.500]   worthy, amen?
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.700]   But what's interesting about this passage is Apostle Paul then describes and unpacks
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.780]   what is the worthy life.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.800]   And we have to ask the question, what is that?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.220]   What does it mean to have a life that's worthy?
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.980]   And although we talked about it before, I want to refresh because it's so important.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:14.340]   To take a moment and stop and think, wait, wait a minute, you want us to have a life
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.060]   worthy of God?
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.260]   Isn't that striking as weird?
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.300]   I mean, isn't the Christian gospel all about how you're actually not worthy?
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.460]   Well, actually, when you look at the terms, I want to go with you to this introductory
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.620]   thought as a worthy walk and say the term for worthy in the Greek is axios, and what
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.440]   it means is of equal value.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.460]   It's worth, right?
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.780]   The idea is that the equation is equal.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.580]   Your walk should be worthy of the Lord.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.200]   The way that other passages translates it, it's suitable, it fits.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.460]   The way that I want to talk about it with you today is the question, is it appropriate?
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.900]   Is it appropriate?
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.940]   So on the next slide, I want to show you that the idea we're trying to hit today is that
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.760]   our walk should be worthy of God and on the trail of the various descriptions, the various
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.800]   descriptions of our walk being worthy of the Lord, it includes, yes, all the things of
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.020]   pleasing the Lord, bearing fruit, increasing, being strengthened, but notice how it concludes
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.480]   by saying that we must give thanks.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.420]   So we're going to tackle this question.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.620]   How?
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.220]   How is it that thankfulness in our hearts, how is it that our attitude of gratitude is
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.300]   appropriate to the Lord, is appropriate to the Lord?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.620]   So I want to tackle here the very first point.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:48.540]   The very first point is going to be this, thankfulness is an appropriate response to
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.540]   God's instruction.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.940]   I'll repeat that.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.100]   Thankfulness is an appropriate response to God's instruction.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.300]   Okay?
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:04.420]   When we take a look at this passage in Colossians 1, verse 9 through 12, one of the things that
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.460]   we recognize is that there is a progression.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.660]   Okay?
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.180]   There is a progression.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:16.560]   And this progression is instruction, it's discipleship, it's sanctification.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.780]   It begins with your heart being filled, your mind being filled and being encouraged with
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.100]   all spiritual wisdom, sorry, all knowledge, all wisdom and understanding.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.860]   So there is this instruction where it goes from doctrines and truths to skillful application,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.340]   and then your mind actually maturing so that you appreciate and you perceive what's good.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.460]   And from that, then you move into a fashion in which your walk, your manner of life is
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:50.100]   pleasing to God, it's bearing fruit, and it's increasing in every way, both wisdom, knowledge,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.100]   and strength.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.100]   Amen?
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.660]   So what am I talking about here?
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:01.220]   And what I'm talking about is highlighting the idea that God as both our good teacher,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.340]   the perfect disciple, and our good heavenly Father is instructing you.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.620]   And my question then is, are we then mature individuals who are having received that kind
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.240]   of instruction, who are having received that kind of sanctifying process of discipleship,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.380]   are we looking back and saying, "Thank you"?
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.100]   I mean, we've all been to high school, and it's unfortunate that many students in high
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.900]   school look at school like drudgery.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.660]   They don't want to be in class, they don't want to take the exams, and they just cram,
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.580]   cram, cram, they barely get by, and they're like, "Whew," right?
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.340]   But that's not maturity, is it?
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.300]   To look at that privilege of being educated, to look at the investment of teachers and
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.180]   say, "Ah, I'm glad it's done and over with."
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.140]   No, the mature ones look back and say, "Thank you."
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.140]   Why?
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.260]   Because that empowers me.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.300]   Because that strengthens me.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.840]   Yes?
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.340]   To exemplify this point even more, now how many of you guys had controlling parents?
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.460]   Or overbearing parents you could call like "tiger moms," you know, the crazy controlling
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.460]   mom, whatever it may be?
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.180]   How many of you get -- you don't have to raise your hand.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.060]   Some of us have had parents like that.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.900]   Others of us, we didn't.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.780]   I don't know your background, maybe you had parents who were really just hands-off.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.100]   They let you have the freedom that you want to, and you made your own choices.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   Great.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.900]   What's really interesting is that parents who have that tendency of wanting to really
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.460]   have input into your life, they don't let that go.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.960]   Some of you guys know this.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.300]   You might be a full-grown adult and they always ask you, "Did you eat?
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.300]   What did you eat?
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   And did you poop it out okay?"
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.180]   Like they just ask you -- they ask you the whole process.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.340]   And you're sitting there thinking, "I'm a full-grown adult.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.340]   I know how to eat.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.340]   I know what to eat."
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.100]   But you look back and you realize, "Man, ever since I was young, they had an input as to
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.540]   what I should dress like, who I should hang out with, when I should sleep, what grades
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.100]   I should get, where I should go to school.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.420]   And now that I'm even getting married, and I do this a lot when I do premarital, I ask
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.580]   them, "How is it with the parents?"
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.260]   And they'll say, "Oh my goodness, she thinks it's her way."
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.100]   And there's always this back and forth.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.740]   Now I'm not just taking a moment to doggone parents.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.740]   You know that.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:16.740]   What I'm saying is, the mature individual as they grow, they'll look back and realize,
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.760]   you know what though?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.060]   You were never like this to my neighbor's child.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.180]   You are not controlling to my friend.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.860]   You're controlling with me.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.620]   And the reason why is because you love me.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.780]   The mature individual will go back to the parent and say, "You know what?
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.860]   I got to call you up and talk to you right now because I got something to share with
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.860]   you."
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.060]   And I realize we fought a lot, right?
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.580]   We go back and forth, we bicker, we argue.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.100]   But I just want to say to you, thank you.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.500]   Because in as much as you were a control freak, you the control freak love me.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.980]   Because you didn't treat anybody else like this.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.620]   So mom, dad, thank you for that kind of attention.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.380]   Right?
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.180]   And then you just sit there and watch your parents cry.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.740]   "You finally appreciate my love for you."
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.900]   And then they'll probably scold you, "Oh, what took you so long?
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.740]   You were grateful."
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.460]   But think about that for a moment.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.620]   There is a maturity of growth that leads to a product or a result when you look back and
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.140]   say, "Yes, perhaps."
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.020]   And Hebrews talks about this and says, "Your earthly father tries to treat you as they
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.060]   know how."
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.020]   Do you recognize for a moment God your father rules over your life?
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.100]   As a matter of fact, if you talk about an individual who is constantly trying to instruct
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.140]   you, it's God Almighty, amen?
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.740]   The difference is his words are perfect.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.100]   His plan for us is absolutely sure.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.060]   But now it's on us, not like immature children to look and say, "Well, just leave me be.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.580]   Let me make my own decisions."
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.020]   No, it's maturity for us to look back and say, "God, thank you so much that you cared
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.100]   for every detail.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.020]   That every little stage of my life, you instructed me.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.500]   You gave me wisdom.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.260]   Every hard moment, every joyous moment, you were there with your presence and your word.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.380]   Thank you so much that you cared to that detail."
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.940]   That's gratitude and it's appropriate.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.640]   The flip side would be absolutely unsuitable.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.260]   To have your arms crossed like, "Oh, here you go again."
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.740]   To complain, "This isn't good."
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.020]   To not recognize the value of somebody wanting for you to be better.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.260]   This is one of the things that I've been really harking on the students in the youth group
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.260]   is this.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:52.000]   The gospel is not just simply that you have freedom from evil stuff.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.580]   The scripture says the righteousness of God is being revealed.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.660]   Why?
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.780]   Because God is fulfilling the law in you.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.020]   He's not leaving you be.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.580]   It's a harder love to try to change you.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.580]   And the amazing truth of the gospel that it's transformative.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:17.100]   It's actually causing you to be better, righteous like him.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.100]   Think about that for parents.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.860]   I don't know how many parents, their main objective is, "I want you to live a better
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.060]   life than mine."
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.820]   Right?
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.860]   Every parent in here has that kind of heart.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.220]   And it's upon us to have an appropriate gratitude for that.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.220]   Amen?
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.220]   Now, as we continue to look upon the passages, that was the first point that thankfulness
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.980]   is appropriate to his instruction.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:52.580]   But what's more, thankfulness is appropriate to the overflow from God's grace.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:58.260]   Thankfulness is appropriate to the overflow, as an overflow of God's grace.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.260]   Okay?
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.860]   Now, may I please ask you to turn over just the page to Colossians chapter 2, verse 7.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.300]   Colossians chapter 2, verse 7.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.620]   And in this passage, so this is the second point here.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.460]   Thankfulness is appropriate to overflow from God's grace.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:22.360]   And Colossians chapter 2, verse 7 says, "Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus, the Lord,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.580]   so walk in him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in him and established
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.500]   in your faith, just as you were instructed and what?
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.540]   Overflowing with gratitude."
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.340]   So it ties in this idea.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.860]   Listen, you were instructed, you'd be thankful.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.900]   You've been filled with Christ, you'd be thankful.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.940]   What's interesting is, is actually from that passage, if you scroll up and you review verses
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.660]   1 through 4, this is what Apostle Paul says.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.420]   He says, "I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.320]   And for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:04.180]   face, that," okay, this is what Apostle Paul wants, "their hearts may be encouraged, having
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:11.020]   been knit together in love and attending to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:16.500]   of his standing, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is Christ himself,
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.140]   in whom are hidden," what?
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.980]   "All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.180]   I say this so that no one will delude you with persuasive argument."
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.460]   Notice how he repeats this idea.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.260]   I want you to have it all.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.180]   I want you to have it to the full.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.380]   I want you to have the true, the entire wealth of it all.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.620]   You see that pattern, right?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.820]   What's he saying?
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:44.620]   I want you to be so capped full, you're just overflowing with gratitude.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.000]   And so one of the things that Apostle Paul does in the book of Colossians is he gives
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.660]   you what you call like the laundry list.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.720]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.860]   This is what you have.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.260]   And typically I don't like doing this because it takes so long, but we have to because Apostle
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.140]   Paul then, starting from chapter one to two, gives you a list, and I'm going to go through
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.740]   it then with you quite quickly, okay?
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.740]   I have this in the slide later on if you guys want to turn there.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.900]   Here, the way I want to present it to you, it's a list, but rather than calling it a
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.580]   laundry list, I want to call it your trophy case, and there's going to be a reason why.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.300]   This is your trophy case, a trophy case that you did not earn, but a trophy case where
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.460]   you treasure the things that you have.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.540]   Beginning with, it says this.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:37.500]   In chapter one, verse 12, he qualified us to share the inheritance with the saints.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.580]   In verse 13, he rescued us from the domain of darkness.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.760]   Also in verse 13, he transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.860]   In verse 21, he reconciled us, although we were alienated, hostile, and evil.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.540]   Verse 22, he presents us holy, blameless, and beyond reproach.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.180]   Verse 27, he reveals the riches of the glories of Christ.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.460]   Chapter two, verse 10, he says, "In him, you are absolutely complete."
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.160]   Chapter two, verse 11, you have spiritual circumcision.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.460]   If circumcision in the Old Testament was the indication, the identifier, you belong to
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.900]   God in the New Testament so much so.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.540]   You belong to the Lord.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.500]   What's more, verse 12, you have the true baptism, a oneness with Christ.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:29.460]   What's more, verse 14, you have your certificate of debt canceled, having it nailed to the
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.820]   cross.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:39.020]   That's just some of the various things Apostle Paul says, "Look at what you have in full."
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.980]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.300]   And so I share this question to you.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.180]   For us to have an overflow, you have to have an understanding.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.980]   Look at my treasure chest.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.660]   And in order for us to be encouraged by this, I just want to tackle one, the very first
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.540]   thing on the list, which I said was God has qualified you.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:09.620]   Now, again, we tackled it on Wednesday, but I want to spend some time on it because, you
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.740]   know, to think of God qualifying us, you have to wrestle with a few things.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.860]   When you think of qualifications, you automatically think, "Oh, goodness, that means there's some
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.660]   kind of rubric.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.100]   That means there's some kind of measure and standard.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.940]   How is it that we become qualified?"
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.460]   You know what's an interesting idea?
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.020]   Here he says, "You've been qualified for inheritance."
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.300]   Have you sat there to think about this?
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.380]   There's absolutely no way for us to be qualified by our own power.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.620]   You do not get to go to Bill Gates and say, "My goodness, look at the size of your inheritance.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.460]   Do you have tryouts today?
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.660]   I made this cool little app."
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.820]   You know, like, you can't do that.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.500]   He's going to look at you and say, "You nerd.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.100]   There is no such thing as qualifiers for my inheritance.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.100]   You're either my son or you're not."
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.100]   Here's another thing.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.900]   Apostle Paul, take a moment to think about this.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.700]   I'm just going to reference this passage for you, 2 Corinthians 5, verse 9.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.480]   Okay, 2 Corinthians 5, verse 9.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.540]   He says this, "Therefore, we have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.540]   to him."
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.660]   He said, "This is my ambition.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.700]   I want to please the Lord.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.260]   I want to serve him."
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.740]   Verse 10, he says, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.860]   each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body," listen to this, "according to
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.540]   what he has done, whether good or bad."
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:47.420]   Okay, please think with me this idea of qualification.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.260]   Apostle Paul says, "We must all come before the judgment seat, and we are going to be
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.860]   judged whether good or bad."
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.260]   I wrestled with this passage quite a bit.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.540]   You know, people in here who are individuals who are driven by performance, want to accomplish
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.940]   every task, you're pretty ambitious or whatever it may be, and you're very, very scared of
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.700]   failure, yes?
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.340]   This passage is going to rock your world.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.220]   And I wrestled with it because I asked the question, "What does this mean?
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.980]   Does this mean that if I do something bad as a Christian, that in some way there's some
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.820]   punitive measure?"
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.460]   You got to wrestle with that.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.740]   And then there was another wrestling.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.500]   It's like, there were times when I used to think, like, "You know what?
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   This is kind of weird."
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.220]   Early on as a Christian, I remember thinking the 11th hour dilemma, which is, you live
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.020]   as a pagan doing all sorts of wicked stuff, stealing, lying, lust, and all this kind of
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:46.940]   crazy stuff, and let's say you did something really, really, really immoral, the unmentionables,
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.500]   and then you're about to die and some guy comes and preaches the gospel to you, and
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.660]   now you're saved.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.660]   People have a big problem with that.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.660]   It's like, "What?
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   No."
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.980]   You don't get to live like a pagan.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.460]   Confess Christ at the end of your life and everything will be peachy, right?
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.060]   And then there's that question, "What if you are a Christian and then you do other stuff
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.940]   that are sinful, which we have?"
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.760]   I've done sinful stuff.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.460]   Have I ever lied after becoming a Christian?
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.900]   I have.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.420]   Have I ever lusted after becoming a Christian?
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.920]   I have.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   What happens?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:24.100]   Now, I don't have the time here and now to wrestle with all of you now, but the reason
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:31.780]   why I'm bringing this up is because I want you to focus on what a treasure, what a huge,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:37.540]   unmentionable, indescribable treasure it is to be qualified by Christ.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.940]   I do believe we are all going to show up on Judgment Day.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.420]   I do believe Christ's account is perfect.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.580]   It's precise and he sees everything.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.940]   It's Jesus Christ who said, "You know that careless word you spoke?
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   Guess what?
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.140]   It's going to be judged.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   You know what Jesus says?
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.220]   You've heard it said, 'Do not do X, Y, and Z, but I see your heart.'"
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.460]   And what Scripture says is that when we come before this judgment seat, things will be
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.620]   manifest, evidently clear.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.780]   That Judgment Day is going to be the most emotional day ever and no one's going to ask,
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.660]   "Do you have tryouts?"
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.860]   No one will dare ask that on that day.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.480]   And even us as saints, we're going to come before the Lord and we're going to be shown
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.380]   all that we are.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:30.660]   And then Christ is going to say, "But if you bear my name and if my blood covers you,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.780]   I have become your sin and I've nailed it to the cross.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   You're qualified."
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   That's incredible.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.780]   Do you get what I'm saying?
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.940]   That's incredible.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.860]   No one can ask to be qualified.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.080]   That's actually called injustice.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.680]   But God says, "I qualify you for my inheritance because I make you a son.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.280]   When you are in Christ, you are fellow heir."
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.860]   Those are the kind of treasures you can't even ask for.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.660]   It seems inappropriate.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.380]   And therefore, when our hearts are filled with that understanding, you give thanks to
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.060]   God as an overflow.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.780]   "Lord, you grant me mercies that I didn't even know how to ask for.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.460]   And yes, if my sin be before me and be made manifest, there's even no way I'm going to
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.020]   ask for a test.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.380]   Thank you that you qualified me."
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.380]   Amen?
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:38.500]   That's just one, just one of the things Apostle Paul mentions as a list of the things that
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.420]   cause us to overflow with gratitude.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:51.380]   And so if you turn over to Colossians chapter 3, verse 15, Colossians chapter 3, verse 15,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:58.380]   Apostle Paul says this, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your heart, to which indeed
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.660]   you were called in one body, and be thankful."
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:07.420]   Verse 16, "Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom, teaching, admonishing
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.980]   one another, with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.100]   to God."
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.100]   This is appropriate.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.420]   But when you hear the sweet words of God, when you have the amazing peace of Christ,
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.740]   then you are going to be overflowing and singing with gratitude.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.740]   Amen?
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.660]   This is what we're aspiring to.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.220]   Now if you look at verse 17, it introduces our next thought, which says, "Whatever you
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:38.020]   do then, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.160]   to God the Father."
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.020]   And my third point is going to be this, thankfulness is appropriate to the glory of God.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:53.340]   Okay, point number three, thankfulness is appropriate to the glory of God.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.180]   Now each one of these points, that it's appropriate to the instruction of God, that it's appropriate
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:03.780]   to the overflow of God's grace, these aren't like new profound statements, but it's important
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.780]   for us to think through, especially this one, that thankfulness is appropriate to the glory
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.040]   of God.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.700]   The passage in Colossians chapter 3, 17 says very clearly, "Whatever you do," right?
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.100]   This is what Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 10, "Whatever you do, even if you
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:27.060]   eat, drink, sleep or awake, do all to the glory of God."
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   Paul recognized here, he's tying that with thankfulness, that your thankfulness is appropriate
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.900]   because the glory of God inspires your thankfulness and therefore is the reason for your thankfulness,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.940]   but also your thankfulness then results in the further glory of God.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:50.500]   Your thankfulness is tied intrinsically that God would be glorified.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.740]   I'm going to borrow a famous statement by Pastor John Piper.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.020]   If you guys read his book, "Let the Nations Be Glad," he says this, "Missions exist because
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.420]   worship does not."
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:06.060]   I'm going to borrow that and use it for my sermon, which is, "Missions exist because
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.580]   thanksgiving does not."
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.020]   Missions exist because thanksgiving does not.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.980]   Why do I say this?
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.780]   Because in the passage in Romans chapter 1, verse 21, what the scripture says is that
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.280]   mankind has oppressed truth.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.660]   They see God, but they do not acknowledge Him.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.700]   Once more it says, "Although it is evident, they neither give thanks to God or worship
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.700]   Him."
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:32.220]   They don't give thanks to the Lord, but rather they do what?
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.180]   They keep exchanging the madman stuff rather than give honor to God.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:46.980]   And now, if you would please turn to 2 Corinthians, turn in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians chapter
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.980]   4.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.140]   2 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 15.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.940]   I'm going to read actually verse 13 to 15.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.020]   Apostle Paul then gives the premise for my statement, "Missions exist because thanksgiving
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.020]   does not."
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:07.660]   He says this, "Having the same spirit of faith according to what is written, I believe, and
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.460]   therefore I spoke.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.580]   We also believe, therefore we also speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:18.460]   will raise us also with Jesus and will present us with you."
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:24.140]   Listen to this, "For all things are for your sake so that the grace which is spreading
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:33.340]   to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God."
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.540]   Your thanksgiving is going to abound to the glory of God.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.060]   This is appropriate.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:49.140]   And now to bring then conviction, if we buy into the voice of the age, "Because my education
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.940]   is horrible, because my job is horrible, because X, Y, and Z is horrible, I have every reason
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.340]   just to be upset, angry, and you know what?
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.260]   I'm not going to take it anymore."
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.200]   Inappropriate to the glory of God.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.340]   We have to ask the question, "In what I am saying, in my attitude, in what I am feeling,
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.980]   is this giving further abounding glory to the Lord?
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.420]   Is this going to inspire thanksgiving amongst all the people, to the people that I shine
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.040]   the light, to the people that I witness and evangelize?
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:26.120]   Is it going to then produce greater thanksgiving to God?
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.900]   Or are they going to be confused looking at you?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   I don't get it.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.140]   Why are you acting like a crazy person, opening up your window at night, walking through the
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.180]   street screaming, "I'm mad and I'm not going to take it anymore."
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.980]   What's wrong with you?"
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:45.820]   Unfortunately, unfortunately, as I read articles, it's a little bit discouraging, because people
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:52.340]   keep buying into this rant, vent, maybe because it feels good.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.820]   I'm going to close by bringing this idea, the sermon title is actually "Thankfulness,
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.340]   a Shield for Falsehood."
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.100]   And the reason why I say this is because when the full kind of process of God goes from
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.820]   instruction, knowledge, to walking, to bearing fruit, and it's going to produce in you a
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.940]   thanksgiving, right?
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.140]   That's going to actually build strength in you.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.940]   And what Apostle Paul is doing, if you guys recall, in Colossians, Apostle Paul is writing
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.220]   to them because he's also trying to protect them.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:28.180]   He says, "I write this so that you will not be deluded with persuasive arguments, things
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.660]   that are trying to trick you in many ways."
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.260]   It actually makes sense to some degree, and that's why people buy into it.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.060]   You know what's really interesting is, again, I wasted my time reading all these comments
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.940]   on the video, right?
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.740]   And so there are some trolls, you know, people who make fun of each other, and then somebody
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.740]   said, "Oh, this predicted the future.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.460]   We're here now with Trump and the government and media, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.060]   And what's really funny is one of the trolls was like, "Oh my goodness, I can tell you
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.900]   never watched the movie."
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.940]   But the man who says, "I'm mad, I'm not going to take it anymore," who's actually, he's
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.980]   an anchor who gets fired.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.740]   He's so mad, guess what?
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.860]   He says, "I'm going to commit suicide on live TV."
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.180]   And rather than putting him down, the network says, "Let's show him.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.580]   Let's show him to the world so that," what?
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.580]   "Our ratings go up."
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.180]   Do you know what the moral of the movie is?
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.020]   When you scream like that, you're crazy.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.620]   And when the world thinks you're crazy, they don't listen to you.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.060]   It doesn't change anything.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.020]   The only thing that's done is push the ratings.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.980]   That's the moral of the story.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.740]   So one of the guys are trolling like, "You never seen the movie, you idiot, blah, blah,
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:32.740]   blah, blah."
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.140]   And then one of the people they write back is like, "No, but it really captures the sentiment
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.580]   of our age.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.700]   And whether it actually makes a change or not, that's not the point.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.500]   The point is we came together in something we felt deeply.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.020]   Doesn't it feel good?"
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.700]   The world isn't going to say stuff like to you.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.380]   Doesn't it feel refreshing?
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.540]   Sometimes to just break a plate, sometimes to vent and let it out.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.540]   Here's an interesting point though.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.540]   Maybe.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:08.460]   But we're asking the question, is it appropriate to the instruction of God?
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.100]   Is it appropriate to the grace I've received?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.540]   Is it appropriate to the glory of God?
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.820]   If we are as believers are keeping sober about those things, we are going to be protected
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.980]   and guarded from all these idiocies, all this frivolous attempts to feel a little better,
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.940]   gain a little this and gain a little that.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:33.220]   You are not going to sit there buying into that kind of garbage.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:38.620]   Because honestly speaking, if you are thankless, our enemy is going to attack you.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.220]   He's going to look for you because all he knows then is he just needs to inspire a thankless
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.860]   person to get angry and then ungodly.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:52.180]   But if you're being sober and your heart is overflowing, you're going to recognize, you
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.100]   know what?
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.660]   It's not only full, it's actually gushing over.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.500]   I've got no room for your sureliness.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:07.620]   Let's aspire to walk lives that are worthy of God, overflowing with gratitude in everything
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.620]   that we're doing.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.620]   Amen?
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.620]   Let's pray.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:17.860]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:22.060]   Lord, your scripture says that your will is for us to be thankful.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.860]   God's scripture says you want your will for us just to pray.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.540]   Your will for us is to do your will in this life.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.580]   I pray, Father God, that whatever it is, the climate of the age, help us to be strong in
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.580]   you.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.700]   Not to buy into the sentiments, the feelings.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:46.500]   But God, as we're maturing children of God, I pray, Lord, that we would emulate the Savior,
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.500]   Jesus Christ.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:53.460]   That in all things, we would first consider you and then overflow to gratitude.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.780]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
