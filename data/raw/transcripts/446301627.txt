[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060]   Hi, my name is Christine and I'm currently in the Bruin Adult Ministry and this is my
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.060]   testimony.
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.180]   I was blessed to have grown up in the church my whole life and my father was called into
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.940]   ministry when I was in elementary school and he served as the English ministry pastor under
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.320]   the umbrella of a Korean church.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.360]   Although filled with many graces, growing up in the church was difficult and many times
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.280]   when leadership changed or there were any kind of clashes, we would have to move to
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.280]   another church.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.840]   This resulted in us moving churches about every two years until I entered high school.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.320]   As a result, church was just a mandatory Sunday activity because I was a pastor's kid but
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   nothing more.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.600]   If anything, I was very hardened towards the church and had an incorrect view of Christians
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.960]   because I could see what was going on in the background.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.940]   Despite my hardened heart, I thought I was a Christian because I knew all the Sunday
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.720]   school answers and didn't do anything bad but I didn't truly know God or have Christ
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.480]   in my heart.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.760]   My greatest priority in life was to achieve the American Dream.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.320]   My parents struggled so much my whole life and I didn't want to struggle like them or
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.040]   have them continue to struggle as well.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.800]   From kindergarten, I was set on becoming a doctor and I wanted to heal people like Jesus
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.840]   healed but in reality, I wanted to be respected and make money.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   I studied hard in school and achieved all that I wanted and what my parents wanted but
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.160]   all the while, I was so empty inside.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.160]   I had no love in me nor the ability to recognize love around me thus I had no love to give.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.000]   I was selfish in my words and actions and hurt my family and friends and many other
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.960]   people in my life thinking I could just cut them out whenever they didn't meet my needs.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.300]   I was self-righteous and placed unjust expectations on them and I placed them at fault for my
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300]   own faults.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.680]   I only loved those who loved me how I wanted to be loved.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.560]   I had no grace and I was clearly my own God.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.000]   Senior year was a roller coaster of emotions and growth.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   I was at a more stable church at that point and was blessed to be under good teaching
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.400]   and God was beginning to soften my heart.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.720]   Through this church, I learned about the gospel and recognized my shallow faith and truly
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.360]   desired to know God.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.280]   I was sprinkled and confirmed at my church and made the decision to live for God.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.160]   However, college was when my faith was really put to the test and I fully recognized my
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.960]   sins and need for a savior.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.120]   After getting rejected from almost every school, I got into my top choice and I always like
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.480]   to say I went to Cornell to become a Christian.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   Again, I was blessed to have found a Bible-loving and preaching church right away and grew my
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.840]   love for God's word and through that my love and understanding of God.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.480]   However, I was still striving after the American dream, pretending it was in the name of Jesus.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.400]   School was very hard to say the least and as I grew my love for God and his word, I
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.160]   was constantly conflicted with whether or not I should be spending more time in his
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.720]   word or in my textbooks.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.320]   And at one point, God opened my eyes to my idolization of myself and how my identity
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   was rooted in my achievements and desires for worldly respect.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   I was struck with the realization that if I was already struggling this much between
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.480]   God and my career, there's no guarantee that I would continue to pursue and love God if
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.280]   I continued down this route.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.840]   I had to decide was it worth taking, was it worth risking my eternal salvation for my
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.140]   career and desires for self-glory.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.360]   It was difficult but by his grace I was finally able to lay down my future plans and my desires
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.880]   down at his feet.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.060]   As I surrendered this idol, God further opened my eyes to my depravity and helped me to repent
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.060]   of my sins of selfishness and self-righteous expectations towards my family and friends.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.560]   My decision to trust God with my career led to many arguments and conflicts regarding
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.120]   God's plan for my life with my parents as well, another idol I needed to surrender.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.080]   But I truly believe God honored my decision and I knew that I had to have faith that God
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.400]   would also love and guide my parents as well.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.520]   It's been a rough road of repentance and reconciliation, a road that I'm still on, but I'm so thankful
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.320]   for how God has changed my heart and has taught me how to love and trust him in all things
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.160]   in life.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.000]   As I look back, I know my natural heart is so sinful and could have taken so many wrong
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.320]   turns but God has held me so tightly and has so fiercely protected my heart for him and
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.800]   I am floored and grateful that the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.520]   in me.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.320]   I stand here today not necessarily as the first time that I am proclaiming my faith
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.880]   before the church but in recognition of the significance of immersion baptism in its representation
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.600]   of my union with Christ in his death and resurrection and my reverence and obedience to God's ordinances.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.640]   Thank you church family and I hope you can all continue to run with me and keep me accountable
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   in this race.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.640]   Amen.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:50.680]   [ Silence ]
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.660]   [ Water pouring ]
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.660]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:07.660]   [ Water pouring ]
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.700]   >> Okay.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.200]   >> Chrissy do you understand when you go into the water you're,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.340]   you're uniting with Christ in his death and when you come out
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.040]   you're uniting with his resurrected life.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   >> Thank you.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   >> And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   [ Water pouring ]
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   [ Applause ]
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   [ Applause ]
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.940]   (applause)
