[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [silence]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   ...worship has not been restored, you missed the whole point of salvation.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   That if your life is still lived with you at the center, and the whole point of your relationship with God
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   is what can God do for you, then the whole point of salvation, you missed the whole point.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   You've entered the race, but you're running the whole opposite direction.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   So lordship is central to what it means to be saved.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It is not one of many things that Christians should know.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Because to be restored into a proper relationship with God is to be restored as worshipers of God, not ourselves.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And that's how he concluded the text, concluded his message.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So for the next chapter and a half, what is he going to talk about?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   He's done, should be, we're done, goodbye, see you later, right?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well for the next chapter and a half, he's going to be explaining about his own ministry.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Why he wrote what he wrote, what his intentions are, and he basically is going to be giving an exposition of his ministry itself.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Typically we would think that somebody would begin the letter like that, right?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   They begin the letter and say, "This is why I'm writing to you, and this is how I'm going to speak to you,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and this is what I'm going to say," and then he would say it, but Paul says it at the end of his letter, right?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And so we have to be careful that we don't read the last chapter and a half thinking,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "It's a postscript, and he's just saying bye, so we don't need to pay much close attention."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   But in fact, what Paul says in the last chapter and a half really reveals the application in his own life.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The application of everything that Paul has been teaching and encouraging the churches to practice,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   it's a revelation of Paul himself practicing it in his own life.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So what I'm going to start today is going to go on, obviously, for maybe a couple of months, describing Paul's ministry.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And so in particular, verse 14 through 21 is a defense of Paul's ministry.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Why did he write this letter? How did he write it? Why is he doing what he is doing?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And so, again, there's about four or five things that he mentions in this text.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I thought we were going to take two weeks, but it's going to take at least three weeks to get through this text.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And so hopefully you guys can follow along.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I want to read a quote from J.I. Packer, and it's from his book, "The Little Book on the Word of God."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   This is what he says, "Certainly about the great issues of Christian faith and conduct is lacking all along the line.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The outside observer sees us as staggering on from a gimmick to gimmick, stunt to stunt like so many drunks in a fog,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   not knowing at all where we are or which way we should be going.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Preaching is hazy, heads are muddled, hearts fret, doubts drain strength, uncertainty paralyzes action.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Unlike the first century Christians who in three centuries won the Roman world,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and those later Christians who pioneered the Reformation and the Puritan awakening and the Evangelical revival
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and the great missionary movement of the last century, we lack certainty."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We have to admit that we live in a culture where everything is okay unless you're certain about something.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's arrogant to speak with any kind of authority, any kind of certainty.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And sad to say that's true even in the church. You can hold on to your doctrines, but don't be too strong.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Don't speak with certainty. So we live in a culture where if you really love Christ, that we're accepting of everything.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And as a result of that, we have strayed away from the doctrines of the scripture,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and we have, like, you can hold on to your opinions, but you don't be too strong on anything.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And as a result of that, what J. I. Packer describes of haziness in our doctrines,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   haziness in understanding our faith, and as a result of this confusion as to what the Word of God says,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   he says, "Uncertainty paralyzes action."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So when you're not certain about something, when you're not convicted about something,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   it naturally, the fruit that it produces is uncertainty.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That's why we have Christians who profess to believe, but very few who are actually committed.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Because to say, "I am committed to this," oh, that's his personality.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You know, he has that way, or he goes to this church, or he does that.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But to be convicted about something, naturally you get criticism.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That guy's self-righteous. He's judgmental, or maybe this or that, and kind of, you know,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   the pressure is to come to the middle where everything is okay.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And sad to say, that's kind of like the culture that you and I live in.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You can belong to a church, you can belong to a denomination, you can be active at church,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and you can do all these things, but don't speak with absolute certainty about anything.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Because if you do, you're self-righteous. You're proud.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Paul, in describing his own ministry, he says in verse 15 and 16,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   "But on some of these points that I have written to you, very boldly, by way of reminder,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   because of the grace given to me by God."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Paul describes what he says. He said, "I spoke to you boldly for a reason."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   The first thing that we want to understand about Paul's writings and all the doctrines that he says,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   there is absolute certainty with what Paul is saying.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Paul doesn't say, you know, "Here are some suggestions. These are things that I think are true."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   He said, "I'm writing these things. Even the things that may make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   This is absolute truth."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And the reason why he's able to speak so boldly, he states it in verse 15 and 16, he says,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   "I speak boldly in reminder because, one, grace was given to me by God."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   In other words, Paul was absolutely certain that what he is saying is because God told him to say it.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It is not just regurgitation of information. It's not because I read some books and I went to seminary,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   so I learned these truths, and so I'm going to take what I have learned and I'm going to disseminate it to you.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Paul says, no, he is absolutely convinced that he is speaking for God.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The words coming out of his mouth represents God himself.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You can't be an ambassador to the UN with uncertainty.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You can't say that I'm an ambassador to the United States and say, "What does America think about this?"
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Well, you know, they think this and we think that, and this is my opinion.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Then you can't be an ambassador. An ambassador has to be certain where he stands.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   An ambassador has to be certain what the president desires to say, and he's just simply a mouthpiece.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Paul's certainty came from knowing that his calling was from God.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Secondly, he says to be a minister of Christ, that he was called from God for the purpose of representing Christ.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   His primary goal is not to be overly concerned about his listeners.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Now, that may sound weird to some of you, you know,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   but I'm going to say that my primary goal as a pastor is not to make sure that all of you want to hear me.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I am very aware that there's some things that I say that some of you are not going to like.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But my primary concern is not how you will respond to what is said.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   My primary concern is, am I saying what Jesus would say if he was standing up on his pulpit?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So Paul says, "My calling is from God, so therefore he's a minister of Christ, first and foremost."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Every once in a while, I would get somebody who tells me that I don't think my non-Christian friends would be comfortable at this church.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Now, I have no intention of deliberately making non-Christians uncomfortable.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I don't want to deliberately use big words, dispensationalism and hypostatic union of Christ.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   There's no need for me to sound with high vocabulary and confuse people.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But the primary goal of the church is not to make non-Christians feel comfortable in the church.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The church was called to be distinct from the world.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The problem that you and I get into in our generation is that we are so concerned about being distinct from the world
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   that more and more you can't tell the difference between Christian and non-Christian.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Nobody ever travels to different countries and complain that the country that you are at is different than the country that you came from.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   You don't go to Japan and say, "You know what? Japan doesn't look anything like the United States.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I don't think I'll ever come back here again."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Because there's that understanding that when you enter into their world, their culture, that there's going to be different things.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   You don't travel to Kenya and say, "You know what? The food tastes so different."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   You expect it to be different.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You don't go in there and the leaders of Japan and leaders of different countries say,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   "You know what? We want Americans to feel comfortable where we're at, so we're going to change our food to make sure that they're comfortable where we're at."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   We expect when we travel to different kingdoms, different countries, that there's going to be distinct things about them.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   When non-Christians come into the church, they are entering into a different kingdom where Christ rules.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The god of this age is Satan.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Satan has rule over the entertainment, over the values, over the direction of the world.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So if they enter into a church body of Christ where Christ is the head of the church, there should be distinction.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It should look distinctly different.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   There should be a culture shock.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And as a result of this culture shock, to open their eyes to see the god that we worship.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   See, Paul says he speaks with boldness and clarity because he's clear who he serves.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And as a result of that, he says he's a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   He recognizes that God has called him specifically for them.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   He didn't only preach to the Gentiles, but he represents Christ to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Of the gospel of God.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Again, in our churches, if we're not careful, we can be a self-help instructional place where people who are having hard times raising kids
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and how to be a good mother, how to be a good father, how to organize your family, how to reach the poor and do social justice.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And all of these things are good things that the scripture teaches.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But the primary calling of the church is to preach the gospel.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   To bring sinners to repentance and reconcile them to the holy God.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Our primary calling is not to feed the poor.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   He called us as Christians to be concerned for the poor.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Our primary calling is not to make a community of people who care about each other and raise our children together.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   All of these things are byproducts of people who have been reconciled to God.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   But the primary calling of the church is to reconcile sinners, to bring them to repentance,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   to be reconciled to the only source of life.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   To preach the gospel. In season and out of season.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   That's why Paul speaks with such clarity, with such boldness.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   He does not apologize about anything that he says.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   2 Timothy 1.7, "For God gave us a spirit not of fear or timidity, but of power and love and self-control."
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   The reason why he writes that is because Timothy, when Paul is writing the second letter to Timothy,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   the spiritual environment has changed drastically from the first time he was in prison in Philippians.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   In Philippians he says, "I thank God for my imprisonment because it has emboldened other brothers to preach the word of God more boldly."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And so it was actually producing more boldness in other people.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   But by the time he's writing 2 Timothy, he's writing this last letter, and people are beginning to fall out.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Even his fellow companions who are with him suffering for the gospel saw that Apostle Paul was waiting for death to come,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and some of them were starting to return back.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And he's writing to this young protege, telling Timothy, concerned that he might fall into this fear.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And he's reminding them, commending him, challenging him, that the spirit that leads you back into your old life is not from God.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   God called us, and he gave us a spirit, not a spirit of fear or of timidity, but of power and of love and self-control.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You always hear from people saying, "You know, we need to get back to the early church. We need to be like the book of Acts."
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   One of the primary characteristics of the early church was boldness, clarity.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   In Acts 4.13, after Peter and John gives their testimony about Christ preaching the gospel, this is what they said.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John..."
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I mean, think about everything that they could have observed about Peter's preaching.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It was clear, he exposited the Old Testament.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   But of all the things that they could have said, after being convicted about the Word, he said, "Wow, they were amazed by his boldness."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   They were amazed by his boldness, how he spoke with authority.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And they said, "These are just fishermen."
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And they perceived that they were uneducated, common men.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   So in other words, their boldness did not come from education.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Their boldness did not come because they went to some specific schools and got an MDiv or a PhD.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Or from their many experiences, they were raised in a priestly home.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Or maybe their parents were from San Hedron.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   They said they had no connection whatsoever from the religious order of that time.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   They were just uneducated fishermen.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So where did this boldness come from?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   They said, "And they recognized that they had been with Jesus."
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And immediately they gave credit to Christ.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   What made these men and their preaching and their lives so powerful is their proximity to Christ.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And that's exactly what Paul was saying.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He said, "I speak with boldness because God called me to be a minister of Christ to the Gentiles for the preaching of the Gospel."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And he was clear.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Peter and John is standing in the presence of the same people who cried out and wanted to crucify Christ.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   He's standing before the leaders of Israel who had the authority to put him in jail, beat them, and possibly crucify them as well.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   What gave them this boldness that even they were willing to even give their life?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And they recognized that they were with Jesus.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Acts 4, 31, "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Their proximity to Jesus and the filling of the Holy Spirit immediately led to boldness, clarity, conviction.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Acts 13, 46, "And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, 'It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.'"
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So over and over again, if you read the book of Acts, it is the movement of the Holy Spirit as it empowers people to speak with boldness.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   God has ordained the preaching of his word, the foolishness of preaching, to bring about the salvation of the lost.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   But it is not just any kind of preaching.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   It is not just regurgitation of information.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It is not just things that you have read that you are transferring for somebody else.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It is the boldness that is accompanied by the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   That is what the early church was characterized by.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And that is what Paul says. He says, "I am preaching to you with clarity and boldness because this is from God."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Most of Paul's letters, he writes with the introduction, "A bond slave of Jesus Christ."
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   So I remember early on when I would read that, I thought, "Oh, Apostle Paul is humbling himself."
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   He is trying to serve the church, and he is saying, "I am a bond servant of Jesus Christ, so I am here to serve you."
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And I realized, the more I studied the text, that though, yes, Apostle Paul recognizes that he is a servant of Christ,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   but the reason why he calls himself the bond servant or the slave of Jesus Christ is to establish authority in that letter.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   That these are not his words.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   This is not an opinion of many experiences, and he tried this and tried that, and he found that these things work.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   So I am writing these things to you because I know better than you.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Instead, Paul establishes authority right from the beginning of the letter, saying, "Listen to what I have to say because it is coming from Christ himself."
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And that is why he is able to speak with such boldness.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   In particular, the book of Galatians.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Galatians 1.10, it says, "For I am, am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Those of you who know the content of the book of Galatians, Paul is writing to a church,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   not just one church, but many churches in that area, because of Judaizers were coming in and they were trying to mix the gospel with the Jewish laws.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And so Paul begins the letter by saying, "If anyone preaches a different gospel, other than what you already know, let him be anathema, let him be condemned."
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   In other words, it is a modern way of saying, "Let him go to hell."
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   It is the harshest statement that he can say.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   But the reason why he writes Galatians 1.10 is because he was rebuking Peter and Barnabas by name, publicly.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   If there was any two people that Apostle Paul may have been tempted to compromise in order to not cause conflict and embarrassment,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   the first person would have been Barnabas.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Because Barnabas was Apostle Paul's mentor in the beginning, when everybody else was like,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   "How can that guy who was just a few months ago trying to kill everybody, how can he be now preaching the gospel?"
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   So even the people who saw Jesus resurrected from the dead had a hard time believing that his conversion was real.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That's how radical his conversion was.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So Barnabas was the first one who stood up and he said, "I can testify that his conversion is real."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So Barnabas was the first guy who stood up for him to be accepted in the church.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So if there was anybody that he would have been tempted to compromise the gospel for, it would have been Barnabas.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   If there was a second person he would have been tempted, it would have been Peter.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Because he knew if he got on the other side of Peter, he could have had the whole early church turn against Apostle Paul.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Because Peter was a leader among the apostles.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Who was this latecomer who was about to kill us and now he's calling Peter out, embarrassing him,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   because he was confusing the gospel.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   He says in Galatians that Peter and Barnabas were being affected by the Judaizers coming from Jerusalem
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   and they refused to sit with the Gentiles and would only eat with the Jews, confusing the gospel.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   That the lines, the hostility between Jews and Gentiles has been abolished by the blood of Christ and now we are one.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But because of their action, because of their compromise, the gospel is being compromised.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So Paul calls them out.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   If we are more concerned about the opinion of man, we are automatically disqualified.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Automatically disqualified.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   If we are more concerned about if I say this will more people come, we are disqualified.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   If I say this, will people leave the church, then we are disqualified.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   First and foremost, are we called by God?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Are we convicted of the things that we profess or is it enough that you just sing the songs?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Is it enough that you are just part of the church?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   See, when we are hazy and our convictions aren't strong, it's enough to just belong to the right church.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   To sit under a man of conviction rather than being convicted yourself.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   When you are not clear.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   But when we are clear, when we are convicted, when we are certain that this is from God, it leads to boldness.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now let me give an encouragement and a warning at the same time.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Let me just sidetrack for a second because whenever we say this, we can easily apply it in the wrong way.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   One, an encouragement.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   We named ourselves Berean Community Church for a reason.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Because as you guys know, that Bereans were commended for testing what Paul was saying to see if it was scriptural.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So right off the bat, we wanted to make sure that the authority is established in the word of God.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I don't want ever for anybody in our church, for my words to be the final authority.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   If you ever get in an argument and you say, "But Pastor Peter said this."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Don't ever think that I'm like, "Hmm, they're quoting me?"
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Job well done, right?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   The whole purpose of why we named ourselves Berean Community Church is because we want you to test the leaders.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   We want you to test the teaching.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   So the final authority isn't what does the church believe.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   What does it matter what the church believes? What do you believe?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   What are your convictions?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So that whatever conversations that we have, whatever conflict that we have, that we make sure that it's a biblical conversation.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That quoting leadership doesn't end that conversation.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So we encourage you and we challenge you.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   If our church is going to be where Christ is the head of the church, and our church is going to have convictions,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   that you do not coattail, you do not just get on the train just because I'm convicted.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   You need to be convicted. You need to see what the word of God says.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   So that's my encouragement to you.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But the other part of caution, one is don't let your authority come from the leadership.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   But the warning is don't let your authority come from yourself either.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Where we, our danger could be that we have all kinds of thoughts and opinions,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   and we want this and we want that, and don't let that be from you either.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Not from your experience, not from your personality, not from your intellect, not from your education.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   That it needs to be from his word.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   That's why Jesus says, "Before you judge others, make sure you take out the log out of your eyes,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   so you can see clearly the speck in someone else's eye."
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   In other words, if we're not right with God, if we're not saturated with his words,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   our vision is tainted.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   So we want a church that debates and has conversations and have Bible studies centered around what is the meaning of the text,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   but we want to make sure that whatever conversation we're having, that the end conclusion is the text.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   End conclusion is what he is saying, not my opinions.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Paul was clear and convicted.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   We need to be a church, not just from the pulpit, but congregation who is committed to the truth themselves.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Jeremiah 14, 13-15, Jeremiah says, "O sovereign Lord, the prophets keep telling them,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   'You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.'"
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Why were the false prophets telling them this?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Because who wants to go and tell a bunch of people that judgment is coming,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   that if you don't turn from your sins, that judgment is coming, because that's the message that God gave Jeremiah.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And the reason why he's preaching peace is because he is more concerned about their opinion and what they think of him
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   than what God sent him to do.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And so the common message of the false prophets was to tickle their ear, to encourage them, to strengthen them.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Verse 14, "And the Lord said to me, 'The prophets are prophesying lies in my name.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   They are prophesying to you false visions, divination, idolatries, and delusions of their own minds.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I did not send them, yet they are saying, 'No sword or famine will touch this land.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine.'"
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   The reason why there's fuzziness, there's reason why there's haziness and lack of conviction
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   is because, again, at that time, because these false prophets were there to tickle their ears.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Again, you and I have to admit, we are living in a generation that in order for the Protestant churches to succeed,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   we need to gather as many people into the room and pay their tithes so we can grow.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   But the danger behind all of that, the way that the church is being established today,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   it naturally leads to haziness.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Today, if somebody wants to go into ministry, and this is very typical,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   this is not an extraordinary way somebody comes into ministry.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   You go short-term missions, you get convicted, or you're active in campus ministry,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   and so you really enjoyed what you did, and so you unilaterally decide,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   maybe opinion of a few of your friends, decide to go into ministry.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And so you choose to go and you apply for a seminary,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and seminary, the threshold of getting into seminary is pretty low.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And I went to seminary, but let's be honest.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   You don't need to be an A+ student to be a seminary student.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I'm a living testimony of that.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   You could be a C-, C-, maybe a D if you know what to say, right?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   But it's just basically they'll accept you. You got money, they'll accept you, basically.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Oh, is that too harsh?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   That's the truth. That's the truth.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   You can get in. Basically, if you want to get in, you can get in.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   When's the last time you met somebody that got rejected from seminary?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Anyway, let me move on. Okay.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   That's typically how it works.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   You decide to go, you go into seminary, and then you start studying.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Some are good students, some are not good students, right?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   But once you enter, there's plenty of churches who are in need, right?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You have youth groups, and you have children's ministry, college ministry.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   We have more churches than pastors who can fill the role.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So if you happen to be in seminary, because so few people want to be full-time ministers
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   because the draw isn't money, right?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   So even to do that, you have to have some kind of sacrifice.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So if you're willing to sacrifice, then you come into ministry, and then you become a pastor.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Because as soon as you have one class under your belt, you're a pastor.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And then once you enter in and you become a pastor, you're no different than John Piper.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Because you're standing up on, at least to your authority,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   in front of people who don't know much of Scripture, whatever you say goes.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And then typically what happens, you become a pastor, but he never went through any kind of filtering.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   So Scripture says not to lay hands hastily.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because some men's sins are obvious, some men's sins trail behind them.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   So I'm not saying that everybody who enters into ministry that way are all bad,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   and they're not representing Christ.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But the thing is, there is no filter.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And so if you want to get ordained, all you have to do is say, "Hey, I want to get ordained," and you get tested.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And so if you were a C+ student, you can pass an ordination,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   because most denominations have a board of elders that will test you.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   They say, "These are the facts that you need to know."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   They were already tested, or they wouldn't have graduated seminary.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So all they have to do is answer these questions and get a decent grade, and you're ordained.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And so once you get ordained, you have authority to speak the Word of God.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's just a matter of where.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So that's typically--I'm not telling you like an extraordinary way that somebody comes into ministry.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Nine out of ten people who come into ministry come into ministry through those channels,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   because the church is not well.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And because the church is sick, anybody who wants to can easily become a pastor.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So it's kind of like, well, we hope that they do well.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   We hope that they have integrity.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   We hope that they're not coming to please man.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   But the truth is a lot of people come through these doors simply because they wanted to, period.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   When the Scripture clearly says not to lay hands hastily,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   because some mentions are obvious that everybody is going to see and say, "Why? That guy is going to be in ministry?"
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And then some mentions trail behind them, like when they are tested.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   You can see.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   You can see their flaws, and clearly they shouldn't represent God in that way.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And so he says to warn them that if you lay hands hastily, that you will participate in their sin, and you will also be guilty.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And so he tells Timothy to be cautious.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   The way that someone enters into ministry, there are a lot of people who shouldn't be up in the pulpit.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   There are a lot of people, a lot of churches.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Again, my goal is not to paint the picture of despair in the churches.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But when the Scripture says these false prophets are running,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   and they are saying what people want to hear because they want to have a successful church,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and as a result of that, they will distort and say and do whatever it takes to be successful.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   But their idea of success is very worldly.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Paul's boldness came from clear guidance that God sent him for the purpose of ministering in Christ to the Gentiles in preaching the gospel.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   He was handpicked by Christ, and that's why he was able to speak with such boldness.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   In Jeremiah 6.14, the false prophets are described that they have healed the wound of my people lightly,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   saying, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You know the wound that he's talking about?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   He's not talking about broken relationships.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   He's not talking about hardships in raising children.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   You know the wound that he's talking about?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   He's talking about their idolatry.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   He's talking about their sin.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   He says these false prophets are looking at the sin and the judgment that they're under,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and instead of warning them for their sins, their wounds, he's treating it lightly.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Basically putting a band-aid over their cancer, and making them feel better, and telling them everything is okay.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Part of the reason why the affection for Christ is hazy is because the way that the gospel is being preached today.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   See, the reason why these false prophets were being convicted and under the judgment of God
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   is because the primary purpose of the church is to bring unrepentant sinners to repent and to be reconciled to a holy God.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It is not people who are lonely, who need community, that that's why he established the church.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   He didn't establish the church because there's a lot of hungry people that need to be fed.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   He didn't establish the church because the world is filled with orphans that need to be adopted.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   He didn't establish the church because it's hard living and we have financial problems to deal with that issue.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   All of these things are a byproduct of people who are saved, but the primary reason why Christ came
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   was to reconcile sinners to a holy God.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Everything that he did, everything that he said was for that purpose.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   See, when the gospel is presented properly, it brings sinners to their knees.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   In desperate need for Christ.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   When a church is filled with people who want Christ, but doesn't need him.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   You have a church filled with people who are singing songs, regurgitating information, attending Bible study, but never fully committed.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Never fully committed, because it is enough for people who are half convicted to just listen to good messages.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   It is enough just to read the books.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   It is enough to be in the community of people who are doing the right things.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   But when we are convicted of this truth, it brings to every single person, including myself, on our knees desperate for a Savior.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Desperate for a Savior. That's the purpose of Paul's letter.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   He said, "I write these things with boldness, because life and death was on the line."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He wasn't just simply covering over their cancer with band-aid.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Even though it hurts, this pain is good for the sinners.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   When people are convicted over their sins, they may not like what they hear, and at times they picked up stones to stone him.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   He never held back this message, because he was dealing with cancer, not a cut.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   That's where his boldness came from. Clarity, conviction, his proximity to Christ and to the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Until you and I are connected with the Savior, we will always be satisfied with someone else's testimony.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   We just regurgitate, "Oh, my pastor said this, these people went there, and I read a story about this."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   But it's never our testimony. It's never about us.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   We're not witnesses for Christ. We're witnesses of witnesses of Christ.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And it loses its power.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   We are called to be near Christ.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   That's where our boldness and conviction comes from.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Ezekiel 2.3-10
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   "Ah, he said to me, 'Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels who have rebelled against me.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   The descendants also are impudent and stubborn.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God.'
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   they will know that a prophet has been among them."
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Now, I want you to listen very carefully.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   He calls Ezekiel to a stubborn nation, obstinate, impudent.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And he said to preach this to them.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And then he says, "Whether they hear or refuse to hear."
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Now, does God know that they're not going to listen to him?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Of course, he already knows.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Then why send him?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   He calls Isaiah.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   He shows him this awesome vision of God.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   "Who will go for me and represent me and speak on my behalf?"
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And Isaiah nobly says, "I will go. Here am I. Send me."
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And then God says, "Go to these people who are stubborn, stiff-necked.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   They will not listen to you."
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   He said, "What? How long? I'll put in my time."
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   A year, two years? When are they going to repent?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   He said, "Until judgment comes."
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "What? Then why are you sending me?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Why go through all that drama of showing your kingdom
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and cleansing my mouth so that I can be your mouthpiece
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   to people who aren't going to listen?"
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   You know, the very first temptation that I ran into in ministry was this.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   You know, when I first came into ministry,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I saw what I thought was a lot of fruit.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I was a youth pastor and started with five youth group kids,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   and then they grew to 16.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   So revival, right?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And then I went to Oron Baptist, and I was in a youth group,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and it started with 30-something, and then it grew to about 70, 80.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And then they transferred me to the college ministry.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   It started with 15, and at one point it grew to almost 100 people.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   So on the surface, it looked great.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And I started getting support from the parents,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   like the youth group is growing,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   our children who didn't want to come to church are now coming to church.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And at one point, our church was the biggest college ministry.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   This is before Bethel.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Those of you guys who know this, Bethel Church,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   before they started really growing.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   So ours was the biggest English ministry in this area for two reasons.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   One, our church was known to be a sports church.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   So annually we had a volleyball tournament, and our church dominated
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   because we had all the varsity volleyball players
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   of Irvine High School at our church.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   So we had the best setter, we had the best spiker,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and so we were known as the sports church.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And then we built the outside basketball court, full court,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and we would finish service, go out and get lunch,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   and we have to hurry up and run back,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   or else you're going to have to wait three games to play a game.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   So we would play anywhere from 1 p.m. to sometimes 8 o'clock
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   during the summer, right?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And so we played like crazy.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   So that was one of the reasons.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   So we attracted all these guys who were interested in sports,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and then we had some attractive people at church.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   That was the second reason, maybe the bigger reason.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   We had some cheerleaders at Uni High School and Irvine High School,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and so a lot of these guys that I didn't see in worship,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   I would see them around the church.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And routinely I would have to ask them after church, "What are you doing here?"
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And I would chew them out of the church.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   But they were coming to church, so it was growing in number.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And so on the surface, it looked like, "Wow, great things are happening in church,"
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   but then the more I looked into the church, it wasn't real fruit.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And the reason why I wasn't satisfied with that is because I grew up--
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I'm a third-generation pastor in our home,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   and I saw everything behind the curtain.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   At one point, my dad was a pastor of a large church out in Korea,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   but he was also a pastor of a church of 30 or 40 members,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   so I've experienced both ends.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And I was around famous pastors, revival speakers,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   people who were scholars who were professors and teaching at large seminaries.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   So I was sitting in the back listening to all this and know all the drama in the church,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and I knew that so much of Christianity is just the presentation,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   and that's part of the reason why I hated the church.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   So when I began to see this in the church, it grieved me
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   that it looked great on the surface, but behind the scene,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   people were telling me things like, "Hey, Peter, can you keep your sermon short?
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   We need more time to play basketball."
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And it was genuine advice, concern that they figured out how to do ministry.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And sure enough, it's true.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   There's easy way to double the attendance of this church.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   One, keep the sermon shorter.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   That's the first thing, because I've heard so many people who refuse to come to our church
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   because my sermons are over 30 minutes.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   So if I kept it around 25 minutes, I know it would attract a lot of your friends,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   because I've been told that, so I'm very aware of that.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Don't be too strong in your sermon, because it makes people feel uncomfortable.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I've had people stand up in the middle of the service and just leave,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and I know why they were leaving. They weren't going to the bathroom.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I've seen it enough.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   So I know, keep it light, encourage them. Life is hard.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   So they want to come to church and be encouraged.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And again, there's nothing innately wrong with all of that.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   But I was so frustrated, even at the peak of ministry,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   when the numbers were growing, because it wasn't what I wanted to see.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And I began to feel like I was more of a recreational leader than a minister of God.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   And so I was starting to wrestle with this. Why do I really want to do this?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I've seen what my mom went through. I've seen what our family went through,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   because my dad was in ministry.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   It's one thing to sacrifice to see real fruit.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   It's another thing to sacrifice to see this.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   So I tried everything.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   I started fasting.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   I did morning prayer.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Friday night prayer.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And there was a period when street preaching was a regular part of our life.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And street preach in parades, on campus, in classrooms.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And so the first youth group that I led at Irvine Baptist,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   I used to take them in front of Irvine High School and have them preach.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   They would stand in a corner, and when their friends would go during lunchtime,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   they would stand and they would preach the gospel.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And for two reasons. One, I wanted them to preach the gospel.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   I was kind of training them to be bold in preaching the gospel.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   The second reason was so that they would never be able to embrace this world.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Because you can't be cool after you preached in front of your friends.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   So they would have no option but to embrace Jesus after that.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   So, you know, Elder Joe, he was one of those students.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   There he is right there. So he remembers. Right?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And I tried everything.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And you get an immediate response, but the total byproduct wasn't what I wanted.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And so I really wrestled with that.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And I don't know how many times I discussed with Esther,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   I don't know if I want to keep doing this.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   It's one thing to sacrifice to see noble end.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   It's another thing to sacrifice and then have nothing.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   At least that's what it seemed like.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And then God began to convict me.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Are you in ministry because you want to see the byproduct or are you my servant?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Are you my servant?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   We all want to be Apostle Paul and sacrifice,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   even die in the context of preaching the gospel, establishing churches,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and then die gloriously.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   But then Jeremiah is a weeping prophet.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And all his ministry, he wept and then he died.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And then after he died, they said, oh, he was the real prophet.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   These guys were fakes, but he died.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   God called Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah to preach the word in season and out of season
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   because their calling was not to get people to come.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Their calling was to represent Christ, to say what he would say.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Verse 6, "And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Though briars and thorns are with you, and you sit on scorpions,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   For they are a rebellious house, and you shall speak my words to them,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house."
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And I'll tell you that this is probably the most important lesson that I learned as a pastor.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   I will preach the same thing and in the same way,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and there are times when people come and they want to listen.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I have preached the same thing in the same way,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   and people refuse to come to church for the same sermons.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I've been preaching since I was 19.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   For the most part, for the last 20-some years, my preaching has been the same.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   And I've seen fruit, and I've seen people refuse to come for the same sermon.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   But I have not been called to build a large church.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I have not been called to build a small church.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   I've been called to speak his word and to do it faithfully.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And there are times when it will be in season,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and there will be times when it is not in season.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   But I do not have that option.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   See, boldness comes from conviction, and I had to repent of that.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I had to repent, because when I decided to go into ministry, I thought I was surrendered.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And it revealed to me when I was frustrated in ministry that I wasn't.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   I had my own thoughts of what ministry should look like, and when it didn't, I wanted to quit.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   But if I'm a servant of God, I'm his conduit for what he desires to do,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   in season and out of season.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   And he says, verse 8, "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Be not rebellious like that rebellious house.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Open your mouth and eat what I give you."
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Eat it.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Before you are sent out, you need to know what the word of God says.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   You need to know who I am.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Look at this scroll. Read it. Meditate on it. Eat it. Digest it.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   "When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   and he spread it before me, and it had writing on the front and on the back,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   and there were written on it words of lamentation, mourning, and woe."
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Every time God calls people to preach, and when I say preach, I'm not talking about here.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   This is definitely part of it.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You can't be in the law.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   You can't be a lawyer and not know the law.
