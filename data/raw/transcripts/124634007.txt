[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Yeah, last sermon.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, we'll see how things go from here on out.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   Yeah, turn with me to Matthew chapter 21.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.280]   Again, this is the Lord's Day, and especially in kicking off Palm Sunday, Passion Week,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.760]   it would be appropriate for us to just look over the Palm Sunday account.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.200]   And so in Matthew chapter 21, verses 1 through 11, that's where we'll be.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.280]   And even as I come up here, I know you guys have been at this church for about almost
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   10 years now.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.000]   And every year, there's a Passion Week.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.720]   So you read the Palm Sunday account.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   You read about Jesus clearing the temple.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.840]   And the question that I come to is, how do I make something that I already know new?
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   Isn't that the struggle that we have when we read the Bible?
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.880]   We read the same things over and over again in Paul's letters.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.120]   And it's like, we've been set free.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240]   It's no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.980]   And you read it, and you're just kind of like, okay, I know that already.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.920]   And I remember one thing that Pastor Peter would always remind me, especially when it
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.840]   comes to scripture, is it's the living Word of God.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.100]   It's designed to tell us something new each time we come to it.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.720]   And so with this Palm Sunday account, what I'm hoping to accomplish is to have you guys
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.760]   look at the Palm Sunday account from a new perspective.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.240]   Not necessarily my perspective, but from the perspective of someone who has been transformed,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.160]   has been changed because he and his friend encountered Christ.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.720]   And so what makes Palm Sunday unique in my mind is not necessarily the account of what
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.120]   took place, but what took place before Jesus entered Jerusalem, right?
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.760]   So in Matthew chapter 20, verses 29 to 34, you have the account of the healing of two
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.640]   blind men in Jericho.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.960]   Now I want you to consider that.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   They were blind.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.400]   I mean, they can't see anything.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.800]   They're at the mercies of their friends and of strangers.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.180]   I mean, they can't see anything.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.040]   But in Matthew chapter 20, verses 29 to 34, what we have here is this encounter that these
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.320]   two blind men have with Jesus Christ.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.200]   They're calling out to him, "Son of David, Son of David," trying to get his attention.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   And they do.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.640]   Despite the crowd trying to suppress them and say, "Hey, just be quiet.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.200]   You're nobody."
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.120]   They yelled out more, "Son of David, Son of David, have mercy on us."
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.000]   And so Jesus called for them and he gathers the two blind men to him and he asked him,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.160]   "What do you want me to do?"
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.760]   And simply put, they ask him, "Give us back our sight."
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.420]   And in verse 34, it says, "Jesus, in pity, touched their eyes and immediately they recovered
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.040]   their sight and followed him."
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.440]   In Mark's account, we know that one of these blind men was named Bartimaeus.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.000]   And I'll reiterate his name throughout this message.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   And imagine being in their shoes.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.280]   They've been blind for, I don't know, for how long, but for whatever period of time,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   they had no sight.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.080]   All they saw was darkness.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.520]   And then they encountered the Son of David, Jesus Christ.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   And now their eyes have been made open.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   And what is the first things that they see as they follow Jesus?
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.920]   The Passion Week.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.720]   They're seeing, for the first time, Jesus going through Palm Sunday, going through the
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   cleaning of the temple on Monday, Silent Wednesday, and finally Good Friday.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.640]   And so what I want to do this morning is pick up three observations of Christ as he goes
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.840]   through Palm Sunday from the perspective of Bartimaeus and his friends.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   Okay?
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.680]   And so what we'll do this morning is instead of reading the whole account, we're just going
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.480]   to read verses four and five in Matthew chapter 21, and then we'll pray and we'll get started.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   Matthew chapter 21, verses four and five.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.560]   This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying, "Say to the daughter
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.280]   of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.720]   the foal of a beast of burden.'"
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.600]   Let's pray.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.360]   Heavenly Father, we thank you again for this time to exalt Christ through your Word.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   And especially, Lord God, in light of Passion Week, this is a time where all of your people,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.400]   believers who have confessed Christ as their Lord and Savior, this is a time for us to
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.920]   recalibrate and refocus, Lord God, on what is most important, on who is most important
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.120]   in our lives.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   And so God, I pray, and I know the leaders are praying and people in this room are praying.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.880]   We pray, Lord God, that this Passion Week will not just simply be another week that
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.320]   just goes by, but rather this would be a week in which our passion and our focus for you
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.440]   could be reignited, that we would see with much more clarity how different we are to
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.920]   be from this world.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.240]   And Lord God, as we study about Christ this morning, again, Lord, help us to be in awe
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.920]   and wonder of our Lord and Savior.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520]   And so we thank you.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.160]   Alright, so if I was Bartimaeus and his friend who just recently received sight, I'm coming
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   up to Palm Sunday, and I'm looking at what's going on, and I see Jesus, and the first observation
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.980]   that I would take note of if I was Bartimaeus is that he is a commander.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980]   He is a commander.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.800]   Alright, look at verses 1 and 2.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.960]   Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, the mountain of olives, then
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.000]   Jesus sent two disciples saying to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.080]   you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.400]   Untie them and bring them to me.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.100]   them at once."
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.200]   And so the first observation that Bartimaeus and his friend would notice is that Jesus
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   is a commander.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.960]   He gave a command to his disciples, and it's an imperative here in the Greek.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.560]   It says, "Go into the village, untie and bring them to me."
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.360]   Again, the time was coming for Jesus to accomplish his purpose on earth.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   From Luke, in Luke 9, 51, it states that Jesus set his face towards Jerusalem.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.160]   Now again, when you hear that phrase, "set his face," it brings about an image of just
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.880]   determination.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.560]   There is a purpose, and Jesus will not fail to accomplish it.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:09.320]   He is setting his face towards Jerusalem to accomplish his ultimate purpose.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   In Mark chapter 10, verses 32 to 34, it describes Jesus and his disciples walking towards Jerusalem
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.520]   for the final week of Jesus' life.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   And Jesus walked ahead of his disciples.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.440]   And for whatever the reason, in Mark chapter 10, verses 32 and 34, the disciples noticed
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   something different about Jesus.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.760]   In fact, it was so different that they were amazed and afraid.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.640]   Something holy was taking place here.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   I mean, they've walked with Jesus for three years, so what's so special about this time?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.760]   Like, did Jesus have a special cloak on him?
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.400]   Did he have extra swagger with him that day?
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.720]   I mean, what was different that would make the disciples amazed and afraid?
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.960]   And I would argue that the reason why is because they understood, maybe partially, but they
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.720]   understood that something great was about to happen.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.000]   Something tremendous was about to happen.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.760]   Something life-altering was about to happen to the world.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   And these are important details because we know Christ was purposeful.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.400]   That he wouldn't just simply send his disciples into this village, commanding them to take
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.800]   the donkey and the colt, for no reason.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.320]   There was a reason behind his commands.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.240]   And all throughout the Gospel accounts, and even throughout Scripture, we find Jesus was
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.840]   not afraid to give commands.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.360]   He was not afraid to act upon his role as a commander.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.000]   In Matthew chapter 4, verse 17, he commands the masses to repent and to believe because
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.280]   the kingdom of God is near.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.600]   In Matthew chapter 4, verse 19, he commands his disciples to follow him wherever he goes.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.240]   In Matthew chapter 5, verse 27 to 30, he commands the kingdom people not to lust.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.320]   In Matthew chapter 28, verse 18, he commands his church to go and make disciples of all
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   nations.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.600]   So Jesus is not afraid of passing off commands.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.000]   And all the commands of Christ, found not only in the Gospel, but throughout the Scriptures,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.120]   they are designed to draw God's people nearer to him.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.200]   Right?
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.480]   Again, whether they're drawing near to God through salvation, right, when they hear Jesus'
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.680]   command to repent and to believe, or whether they're obeying some sort of command that
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:51.200]   is designed to sanctify the individual, like love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.840]   All these things, all these commands that Christ lays out before us, these imperatives,
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.000]   all have a purpose.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   I know, when we hear the word command or commander, it conjures up a negative type of reaction,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   right?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.560]   Sometimes when we hear the word command, we get the idea of it being burdensome or unwanted,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   right?
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.320]   You know, I moved back in with my mom, and I love my mom to death.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   I mean, I love her a lot.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.560]   She's invested in me so much.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.480]   But even this morning, as I got up this morning to just, you know, kind of finalize this sermon,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.600]   she was giving me my commands, like, "Oh, you need to clean up before you go.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.880]   Oh, you need to eat this vitamin.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.960]   It's good for you."
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.040]   You know, and, "Oh, you do this, do that, do that."
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.480]   I'm just like, "Okay, Mom."
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   I'm 31 years old.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.160]   I know what to do.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.280]   At those times, when she's passing out those commands, it's burdensome.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.240]   It's unwanted.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:01.360]   But I think that it's not the commands itself that are burdensome.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   I think oftentimes it's who the command is coming from that can make the commands burdensome
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.920]   and unwanted, right?
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.600]   So for example, when I was in high school, I played a year of high school football.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.920]   And our freshman team, I mean, our freshman team was pretty good.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.760]   I mean, we were almost undefeated.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.480]   We lost one game.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   And it was fun.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.360]   You know, I mean, whenever the coach told us to run a play, we ran the play.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.160]   When the coach told us to do something, we would go and do it.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.000]   And we wouldn't just simply do it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.440]   We would do it with passion, with conviction, with focus, to execute the plan to be complete.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.120]   Now, I came a little bit late into the season.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.640]   And so obviously all the positions that I would want to play were already taken.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.280]   But the JV team needed spots.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   And so I didn't get promoted to JV.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.760]   I was just simply sent there to be like an extra body, you know, just to be used.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   Now that JV team was, it wasn't as awesome as our freshman team.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.320]   I mean, the record was pretty bad.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.200]   They're winless.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.920]   And you know, you could tell by the players on the JV team that when the coach was giving
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:20.120]   them a play to accomplish or to execute, that they weren't as eager or they weren't as focused
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.440]   or they weren't as precise in executing that play.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.560]   When the coach would tell them to do something, you could tell they were dragging their feet.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.920]   All because they didn't trust the coach.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.640]   The coach has led them into this path where they were winless and they didn't have anything
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   to be proud about.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.100]   And so they didn't listen to him.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.120]   So his commands became burdensome, became unwanted.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.160]   In the same way too, depending on who gives the commands affects our focus, affects our
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.000]   passion, affects the way we want to execute these commands.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.800]   And we know with Christ as the great commander, that he will never lead us astray.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.920]   I don't think there's anyone in this room that will come up and say that Jesus led me
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.160]   astray.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.080]   I followed Jesus and my life turned out being the worst for it.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.160]   I think all of us could safely say that Jesus is good.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.840]   And what he commands us to do is going to be good for me.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.520]   And it's going to be honoring to God.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.400]   And so we need to understand that Jesus is a commander.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.200]   He will command us however he sees fit and it will be good.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.080]   So Bartimaeus and his buddy, they're looking at Jesus and saying, "Okay, he's a commander.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.240]   Great."
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:50.120]   Now the second thing that I would assume Bartimaeus would observe is that Jesus is a fulfiller.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.960]   He is a fulfiller.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.840]   Jesus keeps his word.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.000]   He will keep his promises.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.840]   Unlike politicians and other world leaders that we may know of, or maybe even our bosses
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.720]   at work, sometimes they may say one thing, but then they do something else, right?
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.120]   Well with Jesus, we understand that he will keep his word.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.640]   He will fulfill it to the very end.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   John 1.1, right?
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.460]   Jesus is the word of God made manifest in the flesh.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.940]   And Jesus was very purposeful in selecting Zechariah 9.9 as the text to be fulfilled
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.420]   on this day.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.860]   Again, Matthew refers to Christ fulfilling some portion of Old Testament prophecies at
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.540]   least 15 times in the gospel account.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.500]   And so when you consider the timing of this entrance and you consider the word, the promises
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:48.020]   found in Zechariah 9.9, again, it is another time in which Christ is declaring, "I am your
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   Messiah.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.100]   I am your Savior."
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.340]   Now we read in verse 4 and 5, you know, that he did all these things to fulfill what is
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340]   spoken by the prophets.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.900]   It says, "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.620]   on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.'"
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.340]   And so I think it would be good for us to unpack what Zechariah 9.9 is trying to get
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.340]   at here.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.540]   And then we'll come back to Matthew chapter 21.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.060]   So again, flip your Bibles over to Zechariah chapter 9.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.740]   Again, it's just two books before the book of Matthew.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.380]   Zechariah 9.9.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:34.260]   Again, to give us a little context here, Zechariah was a book written to the nation of Israel
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.540]   when they returned from their exile.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.540]   Right?
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.020]   For 70 years, they were gone.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.980]   They were kicked out of their land.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.580]   And so now being part of the, under the regime of the Persians, they allow, King Cyrus allowed
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.660]   them to come back to the land and to kind of like rebuild it, to restore it.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.580]   And so Zechariah was a book written during this time.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:01.620]   And Zechariah, the book itself, is filled with a lot of hope and a lot of positive prophecies
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:07.780]   as a means to motivate the Israelites to continue to rebuild the temple, to rebuild their lives
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.520]   in this land.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.220]   And specifically Zechariah 9.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.820]   Zechariah 9 starts off with this judgment upon, not Israel, okay?
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.660]   I know we read a lot of the Old Testament prophets and we just simply assume all judgment
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.340]   is on Israel because they're just a bad, bad people, you know?
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.380]   But this time, no, it's judgment upon Israel's enemies.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.380]   Okay?
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.120]   Again, this prophecy is designed to be hopeful for the nation of Israel at this time.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.660]   And so here we have God basically prophesying, "Your enemies will be judged.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.660]   They will be punished.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:47.580]   They will be, um, um, they will no longer exist."
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:54.340]   And then after all that in verses, chapter 9, verses 1 through 8, we go to verse 9.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.060]   In verse 9, here we have a positive prophecy.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.580]   It says, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.220]   Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.260]   Behold, your King is coming to you.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.060]   Righteous and having salvation is He.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.860]   Full and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:22.100]   Remember, during Zechariah's time, they did not have a king.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.980]   In Israel's, in context of Israel's mindset, having a king, having a Davidic king on a
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.180]   throne was essential.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.780]   That's how they knew they were God's people.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.820]   They look at the throne and there's no one sitting there.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.740]   They have a governor, but he's not a king.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.100]   And so, put yourself in the shoes of these Israelites.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.100]   They're coming into a land.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.340]   They have to rebuild everything.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.580]   They don't know how their, how their government's going to be, what their government's going
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.900]   to look like.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.420]   And here's a prophecy that a king is coming to them.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.020]   And he's going to be identified as one riding on a young colt.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.740]   Again, that image of riding on this colt or this young animal indicates a peaceful transition,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.740]   right?
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.500]   It's supposed to indicate that there's peace coming.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.420]   Victory is coming.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:20.520]   And so, you know, putting ourselves in Barnabas' shoes, we're seeing that Jesus is a commander.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.700]   He commands His disciples to do stuff and they follow and obey.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.700]   Great.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   Oh, look at this.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.980]   He's asking for a colt.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.460]   And that's fulfilling Zechariah 9.9.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.940]   Great.
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.620]   Maybe with our newfound eyes, we could actually go back to Zechariah 9.9 and let's read a
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.620]   little bit here.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.820]   Oh, look, there is a king that is coming, right?
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.500]   And so, that's my third observation here.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.980]   If I was Barnabas and his friend, newly given sight, I would take notice that there is a
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.300]   king.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.220]   Jesus is the king.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.300]   And there are three characteristics that are listed off for here, listed off to us in Zechariah
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:02.180]   9.9 that I want us to pay close attention to.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.060]   The first characteristic of this king is he is righteous.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.220]   He is a righteous king.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.480]   The Hebrew word is "zaddik," which means to conform to a moral or ethical standard.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.940]   And as believers of the Word of God, we know that all human beings, mankind, has been created
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.820]   in the image of God.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.940]   And so, the standard, the moral and ethical standard that all mankind is under is not
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.020]   man's own making.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.740]   We all affirm that the standard, the moral and ethical standard that we live by is set
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.060]   by the Creator Himself, God.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.880]   And so, that is the standard in which this king that is coming in Zechariah 9.9 is living
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   up to.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.980]   He is righteous.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.860]   He lives up to the standard of God's righteousness.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:20:00.020]   In other words, the king that is described here in Zechariah 9.9 is someone who knows
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.860]   how to respond rightly in all and every situations.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.740]   He knows how to respond rightly.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.020]   If the situation calls for mercy, the king will show mercy.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.220]   If the situation calls for correction, the king will correct.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.820]   And this is something that should really stand out to us as sinners, right?
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.940]   Because all of us are in different situations, in different areas of our lives.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.580]   And sometimes we respond correctly, but I would say most of the time we don't respond
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.780]   correctly, right?
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.340]   And so, this is an amazing characteristic that this king has.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.660]   He is righteous.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.940]   He knows how to respond.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:50.740]   If we contrast this to Israel's kings, right, then we know that Israel's kings, even though
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.740]   they strive after righteousness, they were never righteous completely, right?
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.820]   Saul, the first king of Israel, not righteous at all, right?
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.780]   Even though he was the first king of Israel, he led Israel astray.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.180]   David was the second king.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:13.380]   He had his moments of righteousness, but ultimately we understand that his life was not characterized
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.060]   by righteousness completely.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.780]   Solomon, the man with wisdom, right?
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.140]   We have so many stories in the Old Testament where his wisdom allowed him to respond rightly
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.940]   to different things.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.540]   And yet, when you look at his marriage, and you look at where his heart was given over
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.180]   to, we know that fell short.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.380]   He wasn't righteous.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:43.660]   And every king afterwards that came after Solomon, you know, first kings 1422, first
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:49.740]   kings 1526, so on and so forth, there was a phrase that described these kings.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.540]   And the phrase is, "They did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.340]   They were unrighteous.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.940]   They did not live up to the moral and ethical standards of God.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:07.020]   If you want to put another phrase, another spin to it, they didn't live up to God's holiness.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:14.900]   Again, as these blind men regained their sight, they noticed that he is righteous.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.020]   He does everything rightly.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.860]   Christ's righteousness is consistent and it never wavers.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.740]   Unlike Israel's kings, Christ's righteousness is consistent and never wavers.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.240]   He responds correctly to the masses with needs.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.540]   He responds to the religious leaders by with correction.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:42.380]   He responds to his disciples with compassion and sometimes correction as well.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:49.500]   All in all, that's how his righteousness is manifested, the way he responds.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.700]   So this king is righteous.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.660]   Secondly, this king is a saving king.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.660]   He saves.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.860]   Zechariah 9.9 says, "Behold, your king is coming to you.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.940]   Righteous and having salvation is he."
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:13.460]   The word salvation here, saving, right, in the Hebrew depicts an image of making something
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.460]   wide.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.820]   Right?
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.360]   Making something wide.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.340]   It pictures an individual surrounded by enemies, dangers, being oppressed.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:31.300]   And finally, someone from the outside comes in, making wide a path of salvation to save
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.000]   them, to have a path of escape.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.740]   This happened to Israel, literally speaking.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.740]   Right?
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.620]   It's not, we're not, I don't want to jump ahead to the theological truth, but literally
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.340]   this happened to Israel.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.340]   Right?
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.300]   Deuteronomy chapter 20 verse 4 in the NASB, it says, "For the Lord your God is with, is
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:57.020]   the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:04.220]   Again, that word there, save, it refers to making wide.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.660]   And we see in Joshua, right, in the book of Joshua, the whole entire book is about this
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.900]   conquest that Israel partakes in with God's help.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.060]   Right?
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.980]   These cities were occupied with other people.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:22.180]   Israel was utterly afraid that these other cities are going to destroy them.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:27.220]   And God promises them, "I will save you by making wide the path of victory."
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.900]   And what happens, right?
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.820]   Jericho, the walls fall down.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:38.220]   So again, salvation is making wide.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.260]   The image of making wide is also a good picture to illustrate the spiritual truth of our salvation.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.260]   Right?
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:50.260]   I mean, when we think about our lives before we met Christ, we were surrounded by sin.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.820]   Not just outwardly, but inwardly, entangled in it.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820]   We were depraved.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.660]   And on top of that, we knew that we were depraved.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.780]   And so we were guilty by our own sins.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.420]   And what do we do with this guilt?
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:12.020]   This world tells us to suppress it, to ignore it, move on, focus on happier things.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.560]   But God says, "That is not the answer.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:22.620]   If you want to be saved from your sins, I'm going to make wide this road of salvation."
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.620]   And when you take on that road of salvation, you're not walking on it alone.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:34.040]   Christ will be there with you, walking every step of the way.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.480]   That is salvation.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.900]   Making wide in a world messed up by sin.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.500]   And we know that the only way in which that path was made wide for us is because of what
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.180]   Christ has accomplished on the cross.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.240]   I mean, think about it.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.380]   Think about when this phrase of making wide, I mean, the sensation that comes with it.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.020]   You have freedom.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.220]   There's space.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.340]   There's space to breathe, to move around, to do stuff.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   Think about China.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   Think about the buses there.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.020]   And the buses are always packed with people.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.560]   You know?
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.940]   And I think the greatest feeling in the world is when the bus comes packed with people to
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:19.900]   your bus stop, and when it stops at your bus stop, all those people leave the bus, and
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.980]   you get to go in to an empty bus.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.080]   It's wide open.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   That is salvation.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:33.020]   You know, I get, like, singing this song about amazing grace, you know, like, I've sang this
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.140]   song so many times, but for today, it was just a different, it was just a different
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.780]   feel to it.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.640]   Being understanding that we have been, you know, our chains have been set free.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   That we have salvation.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.480]   And it's made wide for us, for us to enjoy.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.680]   Salvation.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.160]   That is what this King is bringing.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:06.360]   Behold, your King is coming to you, righteous, and having salvation.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.360]   The last characteristic of this King, Zechariah 9, is humble.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.160]   He is a humble King.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.680]   Definition of humility in Hebrew, I'm just going to read it, but it says, "This adjective
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:28.000]   stresses the moral and spiritual condition of the godly as the goal of affliction, implying
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.180]   that the state is joined with a suffering life rather than with one of worldly happiness
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.180]   and abundance."
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:41.520]   In other words, humility is choosing the hard path of suffering because it is the path that
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.120]   will enhance and draw the believer closer to God.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.600]   Humility does not mean we are passive.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.460]   Humility does not mean we are limp, like a wet noodle.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.920]   Humility means we make a purposeful decision to no longer live for ourselves, but to live
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.840]   for Christ.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:08.240]   Because we know that path will draw us closer to God.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   There is no other motive in choosing this harder path of suffering other than to have
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.740]   God and no one else.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:24.340]   I mean, when you look at Zechariah 9, 9, and you can go back to Matthew chapter 21 for
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:39.820]   the rest of this sermon, but in Matthew chapter 21, notice that Matthew does not really put
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.720]   the full content of Zechariah 9, 9 in here, right?
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.620]   Verse 5 says, "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you.'"
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.620]   Okay.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   Humble.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:59.020]   Zechariah talks about righteousness and bringing salvation.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.980]   Where's that?
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.900]   Did Matthew make a mistake?
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:10.820]   Did Matthew, was he trying to like, you know, did he just have a bad copy of the Old Testament?
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.740]   No.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:21.280]   Matthew wanted us to focus on the fact that though he is being triumphantly received by
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.980]   the people of Israel, that this path, this entry was a humbling entry.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.220]   Jesus is taking the hard path of suffering.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.400]   Though the crowds are cheering, he is about to suffer.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.620]   He is humbling himself.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.100]   Christ suffered prior to all this as well.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.140]   He suffered by putting on human flesh.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:55.340]   He suffered by forfeiting perfect fellowship with the triune God to come to this earth.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:04.140]   Christ suffered by having human limitations like sleep and hunger and pain.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.900]   Christ suffered by having enemies that threatened his life.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.700]   Christ suffered being used as a tool by the masses.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.020]   Right?
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.180]   You remember, he fed the 5,000 and what did they want?
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.180]   They just wanted more food.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.460]   They didn't want Christ.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.340]   They wanted his blessings.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.100]   Remember those 10 lepers, but only one came back?
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.940]   Jesus was being used as a tool and he suffered.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.780]   So we can understand Jesus when he states in Isaiah chapter 49 verse 4, and that's one
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.860]   of the servant songs, and we know that Jesus is the suffering servant in those songs.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.900]   It says, "But I said, I have labored in vain.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.620]   I have spent my strength for nothing in vanity.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.260]   Yet surely my right is with the Lord and my recompense with my God."
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:03.100]   And again, we know, if you've been, if you're reading the Bible, you know that the ultimate
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:09.020]   expression of humiliation, the ultimate expression of humility that Christ received at the hands
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:17.380]   of mankind was the physical torture, the mockings, the beatings, and ultimately the crucifixion
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.740]   upon the cross.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.700]   That is what Zechariah 9, 9 is pointing us to.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.260]   That is what Matthew is trying to point us to in Matthew chapter 21 verse 5.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:34.020]   That when Christ came on Palm Sunday, he came not to be exalted, but he came to be humbled,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:42.020]   to suffer, to die for the sole purpose of redeeming his people of their sins.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:47.940]   Christ is the humble king.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.020]   And so I want to conclude with this question, and again, I titled this sermon, "Who are
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.700]   you fixing your eyes upon?"
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.460]   Because imagine Bartimaeus and his friend.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.660]   They had just regained sight by encountering Jesus.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:10.020]   And so you can imagine the excitement, the joy that they have in knowing that this man
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.460]   just gave them their sight back.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.020]   And so they follow Jesus.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.440]   They're fixing their eyes upon him on Palm Sunday, and they're seeing him being exalted
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   and celebrated.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.380]   People are saying, "Hosanna in the highest.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.260]   Glory to God for the son of David has come."
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.460]   And Bartimaeus and his friend are like, "Yeah, man, that's the guy that I want to follow.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.140]   I want to fix my eyes upon this guy.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.700]   I want to do whatever he does."
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.860]   Monday comes around, and blind man Bartimaeus and his friend observe Jesus clearing out
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:49.300]   the temples and rebuking the Pharisees and the religious leaders of their time.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.540]   And so maybe Bartimaeus and his friend are starting to think, "Oh, what's Jesus doing
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.980]   here?
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.420]   He's upsetting a couple of folk, some people here, some religious leaders here.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.420]   I don't know.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.180]   Let's just keep our eyes focused on him.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.420]   Let's just keep following him and see what happens."
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:16.300]   Again, I'm reading into the lines here, but maybe Bartimaeus and his friends were able
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:22.220]   to hear some of Jesus' teachings to his disciples.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:29.260]   And perhaps in hearing the teachings, they're beginning to hear Jesus is leaving them?
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.300]   Where is Jesus going?
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.700]   He's talking about this helper that he's going to send back to them, but we don't want the
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.700]   helper.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.700]   We want Jesus.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.580]   I don't know.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.300]   Should we keep our eyes fixed on him?
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:50.660]   And finally, Good Friday comes along, and they see Jesus just five days before being
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:59.060]   exalted and celebrated, but now being mocked, being beaten, being tortured, being spat upon,
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.260]   ultimately being crucified.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.180]   So now blind man Bartimaeus and his friend have to ask, "Are we going to keep our eyes
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.380]   fixed on this man who gave us new sight?"
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.540]   Again, I don't know.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:22.420]   I mean, Bartimaeus was named in Mark chapter 10, and so perhaps he was a prominent member
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.020]   of the church after all this happened.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.880]   I don't know about his other friend.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.380]   But the question that we have to ask ourselves this morning, are we fixing our eyes upon
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.180]   Jesus?
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:43.940]   Not the Jesus that is all cuddly and is there at our side, but are we looking at the Jesus
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:50.020]   who is a commander, who is a fulfiller, who is the righteous king, the king that brings
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.580]   salvation but also the humble king?
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.820]   Are we fixing our eyes upon that man?
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.180]   And if we are, are we following him?
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:08.420]   I pray that our church will not become a church characterized by people who fixed their eyes
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.260]   upon Jesus at a distance.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.660]   I pray that our church will not go in that direction.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.940]   But as we fix our gaze upon Jesus, as our gaze upon Jesus becomes clearer because of
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.340]   our sanctification, because of the sanctification that God brings into our lives, that we would
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:34.460]   say in our hearts and in our eyes, "I want to follow this man."
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.940]   You know, it's such an easy principle.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.320]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.060]   When I was in college, that was the principle I wanted to live by.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:48.260]   And at that time, it just sounded cool and godly, right?
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.020]   But as I continued to grow and practice this principle, it became more and more real to
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.340]   me that this is a principle that I need to live by.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.140]   It is not just a cool saying that I can post up on my Facebook wall, but rather it needs
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.860]   to be a characteristic mark in my life.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:11.680]   To be known as a man, to be known as a family that fixes our eyes upon our Lord and Savior
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:19.480]   Jesus Christ, going wherever He goes, doing whatever He does.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:24.840]   And as a church, are you ready to answer that question?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.040]   Who are you fixing your eyes upon?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:36.340]   So go ahead and bow your heads and pray as the praise team comes up.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:42.320]   Passion week is a great opportunity for us to ask this question on a daily basis.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.600]   Am I fixing my eyes upon Jesus?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.900]   Am I fixing my eyes upon the right Jesus?
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:56.440]   And as we go through the passion passages, I pray that it will not simply be old news,
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:02.120]   but rather you will understand that everything that takes place in the next seven days is
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:08.800]   designed to draw us closer to God, is designed to sanctify us so we can see Christ more clearly
