[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   They were asking me questions.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   Sorry about that.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880]   My clock is broken.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   All right, so College Study Hall.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   All right, sorry about that.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.880]   The College Study Hall is starting today.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   If you wanna bring snacks and stuff,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   please drop it off in the cafe area.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.880]   Living While Pregnancy Baby Bottle Drive is happening,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   and you need to turn that in at the latest by next Sunday.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   Next Sunday, Christmas service.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   On the 22nd, there's going to be a booth for the invite,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   people who are coming here to hear the gospel
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   and participate, and make sure you take one of these
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   to initiate conversation or invite people.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   There's gonna be more of it when you go outside.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   New Year's Eve service at the end.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   Again, to inaugurate and to dedicate our first fruit
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   to the Lord, we invite you to come to that service
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   at 11 p.m.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   There is a ping-pong tournament.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   That's not up here, but that you can sign up for.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   That happens during the day, on that day.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   BBA WBBA, if you're planning to sign up for that,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   please sign up for that.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   This is the last week to sign up,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   so there's gonna be a table outside,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   so please visit that after the service.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Let me take my--catch my breath.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   All right.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   And then, hermeneutics.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   Next session of Bible study is gonna be hermeneutics,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   and so we need you to sign up for that as soon as possible
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   so that we can get the small groups
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   and the home groups ready, okay?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   And so Pastor Mark will be teaching that
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   for the next session.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   It's gonna start on February the 5th, okay?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.880]   All right, let me pray for the offering.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.880]   Again, if you brought a physical offering,
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   please visit our box in the back as you're on your way out.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   Let's pray.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   We pray, Father God, that you would cause our hearts
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   and our minds to be completely devoted to you,
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   and whatever distractions that we may have brought
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   into this room, we pray that your word,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   our singing, even our giving,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   will cause our eyes to be fixated on Christ.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   Help us, Lord God, to give out of joy,
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   out of abundance, Lord God, of thanksgiving,
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   I wanted to go over this song with you,
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   just the lyrics.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   It talks about trusting in Christ and his wisdom,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   not our own.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   If you read the lyrics with me, verse 1 says,
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.180]   "Christ our wisdom, we are humbled when you hide your ways
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.180]   from us.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   We remember each one, good and glorious.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   Help us trust when we grow weary.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.180]   Free us from our anxious thoughts.

[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.180]   I'm going to read verse 2 as well.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.200]   "Christ our wisdom, be our gladness when we fail to

[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   So as we sing this, I pray that we reflect on who Christ is,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.220]   that he is God and we are not.

[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.480]   10 verses 1 through 4. Now after this the Lord appointed 70 others and sent them in pairs ahead
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.680]   of him to every city and place where he himself was going to come and he was saying to them the
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.000]   harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.920]   send out laborers into his harvest. Go behold I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.560]   carry no money belt no bag no shoes and greet no one on the way. Let's pray.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   Father we pray for understanding. We pray for conviction as you are the potter and we are the
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.880]   clay mold us as you have ordained. Help us Lord God to lift our eyes to Christ and that we would
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.320]   hear from you and that your sheep will hear your voice and follow you in Jesus name we pray amen.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:54.560]   We're our church is uh headed into our 28th year anniversary in maybe about four or five months
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   and so we've been around again compared to other churches obviously a little bit longer
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   but the temptation that I notice as we see churches kind of you know that's been planted
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.560]   for a long time is that you forget the reason why the church was planted and then it becomes a church
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.520]   where you just a church gathered together and this is where you do life together this is where you
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.880]   raise children together but when you first plant the church almost every church has the same goal
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.240]   which is to reach the lost and so usually the church plants are the ones who go out and invite
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.000]   people they're out on the street inviting people to hear the gospel they're the ones who have events
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.440]   to to to reach the the people around them but the if we're not careful we can kind of settle into
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.520]   just a church like this is what church is supposed to be and we forget our ultimate calling the text
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:53.440]   that we're going to be looking at today is Jesus is calling to the harvest when we think about the
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.520]   great commission we usually think about Matthew 28 right before he ascends he calls his disciples to
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.600]   say go make disciples of all the nations right baptizing the name of the father son of the holy
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.840]   spirit teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and we know what that calling is
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.640]   it's called a great commission because that's the last thing that he told his disciples before he
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.480]   left but he didn't spring that just out of the blue he didn't just all of a sudden at the end
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.760]   now that your training is over this is how i want you to apply it he said from the very get-go when
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:31.280]   he called them follow me and i will make you fishers of men so from the very beginning everything that
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:37.200]   he did was to train them get them ready so that when christ is done with his earthly ministry
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.880]   that they would continue to go and make disciples so all he was doing at the great commission before
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.720]   he ascends was to remind them what jesus was doing for all those three years and the primary thing
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.080]   that he was trying to do more than any anything else more than technique was to reveal to his
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   disciples and to people who he was so that's why at the end when he's begin to head to the cross
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:06.320]   he doesn't say are you ready now to do the work he says no who do you say that i am who do you say
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.880]   that i am he wanted to make sure that they properly believed who he is that they were genuine
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.920]   followers of christ and everything that they're going to do and the building of this church he
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:26.000]   says upon this confession i will build my church and so from the beginning from the time of christ
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.120]   until today the mission has not changed he has called us to the harvest the text that we're
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.560]   going to be looking at today i want to i want to describe in these four verses four characteristic
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.480]   four things that that i want us to take a look at about the harvest and and why this is so important
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:50.080]   number one every single person all of us has been called to the harvest you know sometimes i think
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.520]   maybe it would have been easier if he didn't call us right and you think about all the distractions
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.160]   and all the infighting and and the things that have happened in the church and how the church
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.720]   has gone astray and there's a period in the church where you know people who wanted to
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.600]   just read the bible would get persecuted and burned at the stake wouldn't have been easier
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.960]   if god just kind of didn't involve the people and just himself just opened up the heaven and
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   and just used his god voice to say believe instead of trying to engage people who are always
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.440]   distracted always tempted coveting and constantly constantly having to regroup them refocus them
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:38.160]   to do this work one thing that i think we need to understand is the engagement of god's people
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:46.080]   to bring the loss to christ is just as important in building the kingdom than to just bring the
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:54.640]   people to the church let me read it that again okay it is just as important to bring god's glory
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:02.480]   and to build his church his kingdom to have his children engage and have compassion for for the
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:10.400]   others who are not here yet to bring them so it is not only important to have the lost come to christ
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.280]   have the people who are of this fold who are not here yet to come it is equally important that the
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:22.400]   people who are already here is engaged in this work because what god is doing is building his kingdom
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.160]   and building his kingdom requires his people to engage in the kingdom work
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:36.560]   you know some of you guys who are a little bit older may remember michael jordan march 28 1990
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:42.400]   scored 69 points against the game against the calves that was the highest points that he ever
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.640]   scored in his in his career after he scored that you know you typically the athletes would come
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.400]   and the and the reporters would begin to ask them and and in one of the athletes that came it was a
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.200]   a rookie named stacy king you guys probably never heard of his name before
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:06.080]   and he happened to be at the podium they asked him how do you feel as a rookie that you were
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.400]   able to play alongside michael jordan who had a historical night tonight where he scored 69 points
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.160]   what does that mean to you stacy and his response was i will never forget the night that michael
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:29.440]   jordan and i combined for 70 points right he scored one point right and after that the only
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.960]   news that we heard was michael jordan 69 stacy king won and he put himself on the map because
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.520]   of that one point right sometimes i feel like that's what engagement in the harvest kind of
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:50.240]   feels like but for whatever the reason whatever the reason god calls us to engage god calls us
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.000]   to participate and even though it may seem trivial in the light of who it is that we're serving
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.120]   god calls all of us every single one of us the text that we're looking at
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:08.880]   it says he's a calling of the 70 if you remember in the beginning of matthew chapter luke chapter
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.000]   nine he calls the 12 and remember we said that the 12 calling of the 12 was an indictment against
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.160]   israel right it represented the 12 tribes the 12 leaders of israel and instead of going to
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.320]   jerusalem and picking up pharisees and sadducees the leaders of israel he picks 12 men completely
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.040]   outside of their religious norm and it was an indictment against them that the religious system
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.920]   that they set up has nothing to do with god in fact all through ministry he was trying to get
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.680]   them to repent repent bear fruit according to repentance so he establishes 12 men who are
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.800]   completely outside or even look down upon and they were the ones who were going to be the apostles
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.960]   well the choosing of the seven was not a random number either because the 70 according to numbers
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.480]   11 16 were the number of leaders that was established to help moses to govern the nation
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:05.840]   of israel so in order to mimic that the nation of israel established 70 members of the sanhedrin
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.040]   the elders of israel they were kind of like the senators of israel that's where all the decision
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:18.640]   making and all the power lied with these 70 men so the fact that jesus chooses 70 no name
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.600]   nobody's and we don't know we don't know a single name of of any of these 70 people
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.760]   he chooses these 70 men to go to be the first missionaries to go bring the gospel to the cities
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.120]   that he was going to go again it was a slap to another step to the nation of israel that the
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:40.800]   system that you have established has nothing to do with me you're using my name you're reading the
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.680]   law but he says it has nothing to do with me so he is establishing a whole new system under these 12
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:55.040]   with these 70 people and these 70 people according to what paul says in the new testament they're
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:01.120]   foolish they're base they're nobodies for the purpose of shaming the people who thought that
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.880]   they were somebody's god calls every single one of us not simply the educated not simply the
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.640]   articulate not simply people who went to seminary not simply who've been christians for 20 30 years
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:21.920]   but everybody because god's ultimate purpose his goal in choosing us is so that he may dumbfound
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.720]   the world system we typically think that if we have senators if we have rich people who have
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:33.520]   celebrities that we can outdo their temptation we can outdo their power so if we have somebody
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.960]   smarter greater richer more powerful that somehow we can be more effective in preaching the gospel
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.800]   but when you look at the way jesus chooses people he does exactly the opposite
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:51.680]   he chooses the nobodies the uneducated the base because his goal was to challenge the system
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:59.840]   their paradigm of what they think is going to bring life every single one of us has been called
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.320]   you know a lot of people talk about calling as like have i been called to be a doctor have i
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:10.400]   been called to this or have i been called to be that the bible never uses the term calling for
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.680]   any particular vocation you've been called as a soldier you've been called to do this
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.360]   even though the meaning behind it is god is is ordaining me and he's helping me and we can
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:27.760]   understand in that sense but as far as the specific calling is concerned the word calling
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.720]   is used to call sinners to christ the word calling is used to call christians to be sanctified to
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.160]   live holy lives the word calling is specifically used for the church to be a witness to the world
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:46.560]   that we have been called to be the light and the salt of this earth so if we are not submitting to
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.520]   the calling the general calling to all christians and all believers and all sinners why are we so
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.680]   caught up in being concerned about whether i was called to be a doctor or lawyer should i go to
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:02.960]   this school or that school the smaller things that are ambiguous that are not specifically taught in
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.600]   scripture we're more worried about that because it has something specific to us but the calling
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:14.720]   that he wants us to obey before any other calling is a calling to be his witness we've all been
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   called to the harvest first corinthians 3 9 it says for we are god's fellow workers you are god's
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.040]   field god's building i don't know about you but that statement alone is mind-boggling right god
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:35.440]   who created the universe says i'm his co-worker i'm stacy king you're stacy king right michael
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:43.520]   jordan has called us to be on his team that's mind-boggling why me right why me and yet that's
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.720]   what he called that's what he says we're co-workers romans chapter 10 14 to 15 how then will they
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.840]   call on him in whom they have not believed how will they believe in whom they have not heard
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.240]   and how will they hear without a preacher how will they preach unless they are sent just as
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:05.840]   it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news he's called people the church
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:15.600]   to send out people and that's a mystery why he cares about us to involve us and yet that's what
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.160]   he says in fact in matthew 24 he says before he comes the second time he said he's going to give
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.920]   an opportunity for us to take the gospel to the remotest part of the world and when the gospel
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.280]   has gone to the remotest part of the world when we have completed our calling to be his witness
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.760]   and then he said then he will come and the reason why he hasn't come yet is because he's been
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   patient he's been patient for us to go and he's been patient for the sinners to hear the gospel
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:54.000]   and to come so the scripture says his patience means our salvation so we are called we're all
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.720]   called that's number one that we need to understand that this call to the harvest is not for pastors
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:04.560]   like am i going to commit my life full time the only difference between what i'm doing what you're
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:10.320]   doing is the avenue in which we do this are you going to bring the gospel as a businessman are
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.000]   you going to bring the gospel as an engineer as a worker that's the only distinction some people
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.720]   think that going into ministry means i'm dedicating my life to do god's work and if i don't go into
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.440]   ministry it means i'm going to live my life the way i want no christian owns his own life you
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.560]   have been purchased by the blood of christ the only difference between somebody who enters into
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.120]   full-time ministry where your livelihood depends on this is the avenue in which god will use us
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   but all we have all been called to the harvest
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:51.200]   the second thing that we see here is that he says the harvest is plentiful and the laborers are few
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.400]   harvest is plentiful the laborers are few the common question that we get especially now the
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:05.280]   church is growing and the concern is do we have enough leaders in order to shepherd disciple
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.560]   to raise up people do we have enough leaders and the answer is no
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:19.120]   and to clarify that we've never had enough leaders and to clarify even further we will
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:27.040]   never have enough leaders because the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few there has never
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   been a time in the last 2 000 years where we had more workers than the harvest there's never been
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.560]   a time in church history where where people would say you know what i want to i want to go do the
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.000]   work of god is it but i don't know where to go because they've all been reached everybody that
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.440]   needs here's the gospel everybody that needs to be shepherded we have plenty of people and so we
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:58.960]   we can relax in fact the more fruitful you are the more you recognize that there is no end to this
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:06.880]   work there's never been a time where the harvest didn't outnumber the workers
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.000]   now i'm not saying this to say so therefore we're not gonna we're not gonna do anything
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.040]   he says luke 4 43 jesus himself says i must preach the kingdom of god to the other cities also for i
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:29.360]   was sent for this purpose jesus said to the people who said i'm going to follow you and he says foxes
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.720]   have hold birds of the airs have met but the son of man the king of israel the messiah has nowhere
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.560]   to rest his head part of the reason why he had nowhere to rest his head wasn't because he was
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:46.640]   homeless it wasn't because he was poor i mean jesus could have taken money gold coins out of
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.160]   the mouth of the fish couldn't he have just rested in somebody's home or use that money to
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.080]   check into an inn or something it wasn't because a lack of money it's because he was working
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.840]   tirelessly so he has nowhere to rest his head because he's constantly on the move constantly
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:10.000]   preaching the gospel that's why he was on a boat fell asleep while the professional fishermen did
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.160]   thought that they were going to die because he was that tired because the harvest is plentiful
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.040]   and the workers are few the reason why he tells his disciples if they preach the gospel and they
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.640]   reject you shake off the dust because you're not going to be able to get to all the cities
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:30.960]   continue to move continue to preach continue to work until when until he comes
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.680]   because when your work is done he says then i'll come until then he has called us to work
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.160]   second thessalonians 3 1 finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord will spread
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:50.320]   rapidly and be glorified just as it did also with you apostle paul had a sense of urgency if you
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:58.240]   look at his short life he had maybe around 12 to maybe 18 years of ministry and if you look at his
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:05.760]   three missionary journeys even with the ferrari even with the fastest car and even if the roads
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.840]   were nicely paved and every city that he went had the nicest hotels waiting for him with the best
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:19.120]   food is mind-boggling how he was able to do that in that short of a period he walked most of the
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:25.040]   way rode horses maybe he was tired he was beaten he was put into prison and yet he kept on moving
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.000]   and preaching the gospel why did an apostle paul get burned out we typically say that if somebody
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.600]   does a little bit of work and and you're doing a little bit more work than everybody else
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.680]   usually the next thing you will hear eventually is i'm burned out or i'm afraid i'm going to get
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.640]   burned out now there's always a danger there's always caution that you're not outputting more
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:55.600]   than you are inputting majority of the people are not being burnt out but rusted out rusted out
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:02.720]   when something burns out it means that there's nothing more to burn if you're burning a candle
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.840]   eventually the candle is gone there's no more wax to burn so that's so
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.080]   so we use that term that it's burnt out the reason why it's burnt out because there's no
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.400]   more candle to burn but we don't say that of these lights we need to turn this off or it's
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.120]   going to burn out the reason why we don't do that is because what's lighting this can
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:29.360]   lighting this is electricity electricity and it doesn't wear out we just have to pay more
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:39.680]   what are we burning when we're working if what's fueling us is encouragement from men
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:47.600]   praise of men if these are if what we are what is motivating us to engage in god's work
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.360]   is man's efforts man's praise man's fruit then whenever that wears out when the discouragement
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.320]   comes when the accountability is no longer there then you burn out because there's nothing more
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:10.480]   to burn but there's reason why this man not just him but so many missionaries so many people the
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.440]   cloud of witnesses who have gone before us why didn't apostle paul while he's getting beaten
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   sitting in prison he's more concerned about the people who are living at ease outside of prison
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.480]   why didn't he get burned out why didn't the apostles who took the gospel and they traveled
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.880]   hundreds of miles by foot most of the time some of them thousands of miles to preach the gospel
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:42.000]   and then die in hardship why didn't they get burned out because what was causing them to
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.400]   preach the gospel was not man was the holy spirit the power of god the harvest is plentiful but the
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   workers are few if we are prone to use our own resources eventually you will burn out yeah
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.760]   our church has 1100 1200 people we have three pastors right like aren't you going to burn out
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.000]   and that's a common question we're concerned you're going to burn out don't pray for us so
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.200]   that oh we don't burn out right although we appreciate your prayer pray that the leaders
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:24.480]   of the church will be so deep in christ that we would be so deep in christ that we would have
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.040]   more than ample energy to continue to do even more than what god has placed on our plate
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.880]   because the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:41.440]   when are when is my turn to rest sometimes i have that thought i have friends who are starting to
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.560]   retire right we're not at we're not quite there yet but we're starting to retire right and i've
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.360]   been at this for 35 years so isn't it time most of you you know work 30 years it's time for
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:59.120]   retirement but you know one i can't retire right i don't have enough money but aside from that
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.600]   i don't know what retiring means as a pastor i don't know what that means i can retire as a
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.480]   pastor but i don't know what it means to be to retire as a christian because i would end up
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.880]   doing the same thing until the day i die because the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:24.640]   there will never be a time where the harvest is going to be less than the workers
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:35.040]   lukewarmness lukewarmness is either be hot or cold lukewarmness basically is adjusting to room
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:42.080]   temperature right if you leave a cup a coffee on the table it doesn't turn hot doesn't turn
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:49.120]   cold it just adjusts to whatever temperature that you're in lukewarmness in the church is just
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:56.800]   adjusting to our environment adjusting to its desires what makes them happy makes us happy
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.880]   what they're pursuing we pursue what we're concerned about or they're concerned about
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.520]   we're concerned about and we've just learned to adjust to our culture we need to recognize
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:17.600]   that we are not home we're supposed to be hot or cold in other words he's calling us out
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:24.240]   of where we're at that we don't live by the values of this world that we don't live comfortable
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.360]   just because they're comfortable that we're sojourners just passing through the harvest
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.200]   is plentiful and the workers are few therefore number three he says when you engage this harvest
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:41.520]   the opposition is going to come it says behold i send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.960]   again a common question that we get is how come the bible says that we're going to be persecuted
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:54.320]   if we follow christ and we don't see any persecution you don't get persecuted simply
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.160]   because you say you believe in jesus right persecution comes because you're taking the
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:10.560]   gospel to to enemy territory right now as an example if you're if you're in this room
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.720]   right and we turn the lights bright um you say thank you because we need to see you can't read
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.280]   the notes we can't function so the light needs to be turned on because you you need the light
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.320]   to function but if i came to your house in the middle of the night 3 a.m and i flicked the light
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   on would you say thank you thank you for waking me up how did you get in my house anyway right
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:43.680]   now you're going to be disturbed because you want to stay asleep so if you turn the light on if you
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.080]   bring the light on if you even if you turn the flashlight on a little light in the middle of
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.240]   the night of people who are trying to stay asleep they're not going to thank you only somebody who
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.680]   needs to be somewhere at three o'clock and you woke them up so that they can they don't miss
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.520]   their appointment they'll thank you a few of them majority of them will curse you what are you doing
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:10.880]   turn that light off the bible says that the persecution is in hardship comes because you
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:19.360]   are taking the light to darkness but if you want to live in comfort and safety just be a good church
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:27.600]   goer just stay quiet just be good to people be generous people would love you if jesus never
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:36.000]   preached and all he did was heal and he fed them he took care of them he would have been
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.520]   adored even by the pagans why would they hate him he's helping everybody why would they hate him
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.840]   they hated him because of what he said he was calling out the leaders to repent bear fruits
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:57.440]   and according to your repentance you hypocrites woe is you that there's only one way to salvation
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.320]   all your pagan gods are going to bring you to judgment you must repent and be baptized
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:09.120]   it was of their preaching that caused the persecution he says to go
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.480]   he says john 5 18 if the world hates you you know that it has hated me before it hated you
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.400]   matthew 5 10 through 12 blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.520]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven not only not only are we to not think and avoid it he said no
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:36.880]   you're blessed you're blessed because you know that you're where jesus is if you want to know
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:43.360]   if you're following christ see if what happened to jesus is happening to you blessed are you when
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.640]   people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.280]   right not because you're a jerk not because you're selfish not because you're acting up at work but
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.840]   he says because of me because you're being my witness you're in the harvest turning on the
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.880]   light rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great for in the same way they persecuted the
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:11.280]   prophets who were before you not only did he say you're going to be prosecute persecuted not only
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.960]   did he say he's persecuted he said even the prophets before him every single one of them
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:23.280]   that he sent was persecuted we live in a fallen world who are in rebellion against the only true
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:33.600]   god and any representative of that god will also be rejected so every prophet that came before christ
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:40.880]   all the disciples during christ and everyone who professes christ in the future he says
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:48.480]   will be persecuted 1st peter 4 12 to 14 beloved do not be surprised at the fire ordeal among you
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:56.160]   which comes upon you for your testing for your testing as though some strange thing was happening
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.800]   to you but to the degree that you share the sufferings of christ keep on rejoicing not only
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:06.560]   are you blessed so when difficulty and trials come he says rejoice so that also at the revelation of
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.640]   his glory you may rejoice with exaltation if you are reviled for my name of for the name of christ
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:20.800]   you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of god rest on you he said don't be worried if
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:27.040]   they persecute you make it difficult for you to be a christian to attend church because he said
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:34.560]   that's where you live you know we just happen to be in a country where christian value judeo-christian
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.360]   values have been embedded into the culture and now we live in a post-christian culture
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.520]   and the culture is turning against christianity more and more but he says when they make it hard
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.080]   for you to be a christian when they make it difficult for you to evangelize he says don't
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:59.520]   be surprised don't be surprised because you're not home this is not your home he said i will
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.920]   build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it i have called you to take the
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:10.000]   light into enemy territory and so if the enemy begins to act like the enemy don't be surprised
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.280]   they hated me so they're going to hate you they didn't like it when we gathered so they're not
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   going to like it when you gather don't think it's strange that the world is turning against us
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:28.960]   this is what every christian since the time of christ has experienced it is not an anomaly what's
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.280]   happening in north korea is not an anomaly what's happening in the middle east what's happening in
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:41.440]   india anomaly was here in the united states don't think it's strange when they turn on you and begin
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:49.120]   to persecute you fourth and finally though the hope is that god is the lord of the harvest
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.040]   in luke 10 three to four says go behold i send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.760]   carry no money belt no bag no shoes and greet no one on the way right
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.800]   i'm like don't raise your hand this is a rhetorical question but how many of you read
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.360]   this before you came how many of you just read this kind of skim through is that okay
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.960]   it's like they're going and he says the wolves are going to be waiting for you
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:20.640]   carry no money no belt no bag no shoes and greet no one on the way does that make sense
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.680]   i'm going to send you out to danger so you would think sharpen your knives that's what i would
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:34.000]   think he would say carry some money you're going to need that right get yourself ready
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.080]   but why does he tell them wolves are there you're i'm sending you into danger
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:47.840]   but don't carry any money no belt no shoes and just be in a hurry to get the gospel out as much
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:54.320]   as possible of the kingdom he says the same thing in luke 93 to the disciples he said take nothing
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.840]   for your journey neither staff we talked about that for your protection if the wolves are coming
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:08.080]   shouldn't you take the staff nor bag nor bread nor money or even a second tunic it doesn't make
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.800]   any sense if you're going to go fight war and he said don't take your shoes don't take your weapon
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:20.160]   just go empty-handed and just do what i say this is the same principle that he's been teaching over
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.960]   and over and over and over again throughout israel's history to the early church and even
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:32.080]   to this day he said because our fight is not against flesh and blood that if you try to
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:38.160]   engage the world with the same weapons that they are using you will lose because we're not people
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:45.840]   fighting people he says we're fighting against dark forces spiritual forces we're heading into
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:59.440]   enemy territory a christian who is gifted upright maybe well educated well well read very experienced
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:05.520]   who's not dependent on god is useless in the kingdom of god
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:13.760]   is useless in the kingdom of god because our enemy no matter how smart you are is smarter than you
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.880]   our enemy no matter how strong you are is stronger than you he knows more than you he's
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:30.480]   more powerful than you so we cannot engage the harvest by our own power you know we have a
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:37.520]   tendency to think that if we have a celebrity somebody who's adored you know and if he becomes
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.560]   a christian can you imagine the impact that he will make maybe a senator maybe if trump actually
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   became a christian maybe if some of these celebrities maybe if lebron james genuinely
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.080]   repented then there will be revival because people would take him seriously that's what we tend to
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:03.440]   think but the bible says but the bible says the very reason why he chose the unnamed the base the
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:09.200]   foolish is because that system that we think that by our power that we're going to overcome
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.960]   we are deceived that somehow we're going to battle them we're going to do better than that we're going
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   to have more money than them we're going to be more educated so we get into debates and we want
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.120]   to show you who knows better is your argument better my argument better and the only thing
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:29.040]   that you have done in that argument is i'm smart and you're dumb and you didn't win a single person
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:37.120]   to christ our goal is not to show the world we're not dumb we're not stupid oh you call me stupid
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:44.960]   i'll show you who's stupid you're stupid he called us to win the harvest you can't get somebody who's
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:51.360]   dead in their trespasses and argue them to life to show them your intelligence and then they're
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:57.120]   going to somehow wake up it's so foolish to think that somehow the church is going to attract people
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:04.640]   by entertaining them and when the church tries so hard to be entertaining it just looks so lame
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:14.720]   because they have billions of dollars with the top talents of this world who've given their life
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.480]   for their craft so that people would pay hundreds sometimes thousands of dollars to come and watch
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:29.120]   them and somehow we're going to three years of seminary education right you with a bunch of you
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.840]   guys that we're going to put production up here and somehow we're going to outdo them
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.200]   and we just look foolish we look so lame
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:48.960]   we cannot fight and reach the harvest by our own power that's why he says beseech the lord
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.040]   of the harvest the word beseech doesn't simply ask it means to beg to be desperate
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:01.360]   you don't be see you can pray but you don't beseech until you are desperate and every single
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.880]   one of us knows what it means to beseech the lord every single one of us knows how to pray
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.840]   when we're desperate when we're desperate when you're desperate you don't need to go you know
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.520]   what i'm so desperate there's something emergency happening in my life but you know i want to take
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:23.920]   a class today i want to take a class of how to worship and i want to you know go through the
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:30.640]   acronym of you know thanksgiving and supplication and no when you're desperate you just pray
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:37.120]   the most effective prayer is when you pray when you're desperate and you know what that feels
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.400]   like whether someone is sick exhausted all the possibilities and you come before god in
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:48.560]   desperation you're not articulate you don't need a contact you don't need people you just pray
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   because something inside of you is urging you to pray because you're desperate
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.520]   but the problem is when our external circumstances in our personal life
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.560]   doesn't remind us of the desperateness we have a hard time praying
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:10.000]   because it's just something too it's just another religious thing to do
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   you know at least if you read the word that you gain something and you can say i can quote the
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   bible and i can give sermons and teach people and disciple people there's something i can gain but
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.600]   if you pray whether you prayed an hour you fasted for four or five days you don't have anything to
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:31.120]   show for other than to go and tell people that you did it but when you're desperate you pray
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:38.480]   but here's the challenge we have cause to be desperate every single day that we live on this
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:45.680]   earth because we live in a fallen world surrounded by people who are desperate
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.960]   jesus looked at the harvest and he said he had compassion for them because they were like sheep
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:59.040]   without shepherd they were distressed and they were harmed they were helpless
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:05.440]   and he said because he sees the desperateness of the people of the harvest he said
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.760]   therefore beseech the lord of the harvest to send out more workers
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.920]   the problem that we have in a rich nation
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:22.480]   is that day to day unless some financial emergency or unless there's some health
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.880]   crisis that's happening we don't live day to day with a sense of urgency
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:34.320]   we are living surrounded by people who are lost in their sins and if they continue on that path
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.640]   no matter how wealthy no matter how poor they are there's judgment at the end of this life
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.960]   and we don't feel a sense of urgency to pray to bring the light to them
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:50.480]   so the problem isn't our circumstance the problem is that we are spiritually dull
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:56.880]   the problem is that we think we're as long as our bills are paid as long as i have a home to go to
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:03.040]   as long as i i my life and my children are safe and my loved ones are good that we're good that
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:08.400]   we're just going to ride this out until we get to heaven and every single day we're surrounded by
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.640]   people who are desperately lost just in the short time that i've been in ministry
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:23.440]   for 30 some years i could think of all the people and sometimes even in this room
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:32.880]   i remember as a young pastor in my 20s and i started a council high school students and
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.320]   college students they would come and the things that they would share with me i would be in shock
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:47.040]   about how they were abused when they were young looking for answers and just you know i get
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.440]   punched in the gut because these are people that i care about and then i hear about what
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.800]   happened to them when they were children and looking for answers
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:02.560]   a few years ago we were out in india and this young mom
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   in desperation asked me and asked me to come and pray for for her because you can see a limp child
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:19.280]   on her arms i mean no more than maybe about three months old two months old and it was a simple
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.360]   issue i forgot what the issue was and could have been easily fixed if she just went to the hospital
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   with the baby but because she didn't have access to the hospital and she couldn't treat the baby
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:33.760]   properly and in desperation she said can you pray and i remember the baby was already grasping for
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:39.680]   its last breath and i remember i was praying for her and with her crying in tears
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:48.720]   all she needed was just access to the hospital something that could have easily just
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:54.160]   got in a car and taken care of in one day and she ended up losing her child
[00:59:54.160 --> 01:00:02.880]   going to the philippines seeing these young girls give their bodies to these old men who are flying
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:10.080]   in and realizing that they were doing this voluntarily some of them as young as 12 13 years
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.840]   years old and they're in the restaurant and they're seem happy-go-lucky but as soon as
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:22.640]   they go out to the courtyard you could see the face of disgust and once we realized what was
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:30.080]   going on this we gotta stop sex trafficking this is so bad and it is it's it's so horrible
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.520]   and realizing that many of them were doing voluntarily because that's the only way they
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:41.440]   could feed their family sometimes their own parents would give up their young teenage child
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.600]   because that's the only way that that family could feed the younger children
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:55.360]   in kenya we're driving around and i see dozens and dozens of little children
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.520]   and at that time younger than even my kids at the time three four five-year-old kids
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.680]   just walking around the street and highway the cars are going 50 60 miles per hour
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.800]   and you see a little girl with a little brother just walking alongside and just dozens and dozens
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.640]   of them and i said what's going on where are their parents they said they're all orphans
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.680]   like all of them and they're just wandering on the street so yeah he said the aids epidemic killed
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:31.040]   so many people that the country could not handle this so they're just kids walking around and if
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.280]   they're walking around you would think that people who but compassion for them will bring
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.960]   them into their homes and take care of them and that was happening with some in some circles and
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.680]   some of the churches were beginning to do that but many of these kids who are vulnerable were
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:54.000]   taken into sheds abused there's some kids that we met at the orphanage center that we were at
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.280]   and almost like nine ten years old and they couldn't talk
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:04.560]   and i said why can't they talk because when they were five years old somebody
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:11.040]   picked them up and put them in a shed and treated them like animals and sexually abused them
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.680]   this is happening all over the world
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:26.000]   all over the world because we live in a fallen world we try to dress up where we live and clean
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.880]   it up and make it look nice so that we're not disgusted by what we see and we're all disgusted
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.520]   about what's happening with the homeless out in la because we can see them visually but that's a
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:42.000]   microcosm what's actually happening spiritually all over the world because the world is in rebellion
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.040]   against god they're spiritually dead whether you see nice people nice homes or whether they're
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.720]   homeless out doing drugs all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god all have sinned fall
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.280]   short of the glory of god whether you go to hell living in a nice house whether you go to hell
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:10.000]   living as a homeless person doing drugs their fate is the same the reason why we don't pray is
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.960]   because we're not desperate we don't see the desperateness because we're comfortable
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:22.160]   the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:34.240]   therefore beg the lord of the harvest to send out more workers beg the lord of the harvest
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.880]   to join the work to participate in the work these people aren't sitting next to you
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.800]   the dead people are working next to you
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:57.120]   beseech the lord of the harvest to send out more workers
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   you
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:08.560]   this is why this church is planted
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:16.000]   this is why every church is planted this is why missionaries pack up their bags
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   and head into difficult areas this is why the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:32.080]   left their comfort safety even for their own children because the harvest is plentiful
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:40.480]   and the workers are few i want you to listen to keith green's song as i invite the worship team
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.200]   to come back up keith green helped me quite a bit when i was a young christian because
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.520]   you know some of you guys who know him he's no nonsense he gets to the point and
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   really convicted me so i just wanted to share this song with you and then afterwards our team
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:05.120]   will come and lead us in our closing song
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:30.320]   do you see do you see all the people sinking down don't you care don't you care are you gonna
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:42.240]   let them drown how can you be so numb not to care if they come you close your eyes and pretend the
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:56.880]   job's done oh bless me lord bless me lord you know it's all i ever hear no one aches
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:06.080]   no one hurts no one even sheds one tear but he cries he weeps he pleads and he cares for your
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:18.240]   needs and you just lay back and keep soaking it in oh can't you see it's such a sin
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:28.880]   because he brings people to your door and you turn them away as you smile and say
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:40.720]   god bless me be at peace and all heaven just weeps because jesus came to your door
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.480]   you've left him out on the streets
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:07:03.600]   open up open up and give yourself away you see the need you hear the cries so how can you delay
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:14.400]   god's calling and you're the one but like johnny you run he's told you to speak but you keep holding
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:28.880]   it in oh can't you see it's such sin the world is sleeping in the dark that the church just can't
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:37.760]   fight because it's asleep in the light how can you be so dead when you've been so well fed
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:48.720]   jesus rose from the grave and you you can't even get out of bed
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.320]   oh jesus rose from the dead
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:04.640]   come on get out of your bed
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:22.320]   how can you be so numb not to care if they come you close your eyes and pretend the job's done
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:34.240]   you close your eyes and pretend the job's done don't close your eyes don't pretend the job's done
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:50.720]   come away come away come away with me my love come away from this mess come away with me my love
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.000]   oh
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.960]   church family why don't we all stand together let that song settle we're going to sing this song
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:13.280]   living hope that in comparison to what the world doesn't have we have so as we sing this song
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:22.560]   i pray that a sense of gratefulness and seriousness come upon us
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:36.880]   how great the chasm that lay between us how high the mountain i could not
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:50.400]   in desperation i turned to heaven and spoke your name into the night
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:10:01.440]   and through the darkness your loving kindness tore through the shadows
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.960]   my
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:30.480]   my very heart
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:42.000]   i'm
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:49.520]   where my
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:59.040]   has
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:20.560]   me
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:42.080]   you set me free
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:47.600]   me
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   let's seal the promise
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:11.120]   so
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:32.640]   so
