[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.380]   We started the week looking at the key to following God's will.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.040]   And last time, in Monday's episode, Pastor John closed with a very great point on Colossians
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.040]   1.9.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.080]   There we saw that Paul was asking God to pour out His Holy Spirit so that the Spirit would
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.200]   remove the dimness of our ability to see God for who He really is, so that we would have
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.640]   spiritual wisdom that experiences preferences and makes choices that are in harmony with
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.440]   God's beauty.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.760]   Seeing more of God is essential to following His will in our daily decision making.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.640]   That was Monday in APJ 1807.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.120]   Go back and listen to that episode if you skipped it or if you missed it because today
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.320]   we put that principle into practice.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.520]   And we do so by looking at an example of one man who proceeded with a major life decision
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.080]   with confidence knowing that he was following God's will.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.560]   He knew it.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.680]   He was confident in his decision because he was following the trajectory of God's revealed
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.600]   will.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.800]   This is a clip taken from an old John Piper sermon preached way back in 1982.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:30.440]   Now, Jesus taught us to pray every day, "Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven."
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:40.640]   Therefore everyone who confesses Jesus as Lord makes it his aim day by day, consistently
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.360]   and heartily, to do the will of God the way that the angels do it in heaven.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   And if we're not making it our aim to do the will of God day by day, then it is very likely
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.760]   that we do not belong to Jesus.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:12.720]   Because Jesus himself said, "Whoever does the will of my Father is my mother and brother
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.160]   and sister."
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:25.600]   In other words, the family resemblance in the family of God is not so much perfect performance
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.280]   of the will of God, but rather persistent purposing to do it day by day.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   The mark of the child of God is not that we always hit the bull's eye of God's will, but
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.960]   that we always aim at the targets appointed by the Father day by day.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.760]   The great aim of the church is to do the will of God on earth the way it's done in heaven.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.440]   And for many of us that means a constant struggle for two things.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.100]   On the one hand, to know what the will of God is for our personal lives.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.680]   And on the other hand, to maintain a strong confidence that God will give us the strength
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   that we need to do it and run interference for us so that all obstacles will be removed.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   Now in Genesis 24, verses 1 to 9, I think we've got an incident from Abraham's life
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.200]   that shows us on the one hand how he discovered God's will and on the other hand how he kept
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.480]   his confidence strong that God would always be running interference when he held close
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.260]   to God's will.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.720]   And I think the reason stories like this are put in the Bible for us is that we might learn
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.880]   one, how to know his will, and two, how to keep that confidence in God's help strong.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   So in advance, let me tell you what I think the main point to be learned about these two
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.000]   things is from this text.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.180]   I think the main point is this.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:23.680]   We can know God's will and we can maintain confidence in his help to do it if we're familiar
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.880]   with the trajectories of his word.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.160]   Now in this day and age, I hope everybody knows what trajectories are.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.960]   The last 25 years we've heard that on the television.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:50.000]   A trajectory of a rocket is the path that it will follow on the basis of its shape and
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.200]   speed and weight and direction so that you can know in advance what the trajectory or
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.480]   the path of that rocket is going to be if you know enough about the rocket and how it's
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.200]   moving.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.760]   Now I think that's the way it is with knowing God's word and finding out God's will.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:23.000]   The Bible simply does not give you a radar screen or a blueprint of your life tomorrow.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   It leaves so many questions unanswered about what you should do.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   And the intention, I think, of God is that you are to be able to find out God's will
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:46.800]   tomorrow by becoming very familiar with the trajectories of God's word that you know from
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   the past.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.240]   And you could add to that the trajectories of his work that he has been doing in your
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.320]   life up to this time.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.800]   If you become familiar enough with the weight and direction and the shape and speed of the
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:09.360]   word of God, then you'll be able to trace out the trajectory of God's will for you and
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.560]   maintain strength in his help.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.240]   Now let's see how that worked for Abraham.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.680]   I think maybe if we look at how Abraham did it that we might become better at it.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.840]   Sometimes God spoke to Abraham directly, told him exactly what to do face to face.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:39.240]   But if you read the story, you realize that those times were few and far between, decades
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.200]   between the times we read of God speaking to Abraham.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.520]   Most of the time, Abraham, like us, was left to trace out trajectories from what God had
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.440]   said in the past into the future so that he'd know what to do with his life, what steps
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   to take.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.920]   That's what's happening, I think, here in Genesis 24, 1 to 9.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:11.960]   There are three trajectories from God's word that combine into one line of God's will for
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.800]   Abraham here.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.840]   The first trajectory is this.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.320]   Isaac must have a wife.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.480]   The second trajectory is this.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.640]   The wife may not be a Canaanite woman.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.280]   And the third trajectory is this.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.840]   Isaac may not return to the land from which Abraham left to get a wife.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:45.240]   Those three trajectories merge for Abraham into a line of decision.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.080]   And the decision he is convinced is God's will, and the decision is this.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.360]   I will send my trusted servant to get a wife for my son from among my own kindred in my
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.320]   own land.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.840]   Abraham determines the will of God for the future by tracing out trajectories that he
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.520]   has learned from the past word of God.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:19.200]   And then he's confident, absolutely confident, so confident that he says in verse 7, "God
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.680]   will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son."
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.920]   From which I infer, once we know the will of God, we can have tremendous confidence
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:42.080]   that God is going to work for us to clear away all obstacles to its success.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.640]   Many of you have had that kind of experience.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.480]   Now we want that to happen in our lives, don't we?
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.720]   I don't think there's probably a person in this room who wouldn't say right now in your
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.600]   own heart, "I want every day to know clearly God's will for me.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.360]   I want to know.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:13.640]   I want to have questions answered about marriage, children, job changes, major purchases, schooling
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:20.240]   decisions, the use of my leisure time and what to do with it, special ministries and
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   whether to get involved and how deeply involved, church affiliation, Bethlehem or another one,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.360]   percentage of our income to give to the church and to give to World Vision and to give to
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.200]   World Relief and to give here, there and everywhere.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.920]   I want to know God's will."
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.440]   I think all of you probably would say that.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.840]   And you want confidence that he will work for you once you have hit upon the will.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.800]   That if he tells you it's his will to give 15% of your income to Bethlehem, he's going
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:59.000]   to work for you and make that 85% stretch vastly farther than the 100% would have ever
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   reached.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.200]   That's the kind of faith we want once we hit upon God's will.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.840]   We want to be led and led in triumph, as Paul said.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:18.000]   Now scriptures like Genesis 24 are given to help us maintain that insight and that confidence,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.160]   I think.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.360]   And so I want us to look at it even more closely.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:32.440]   The reason that I call these three things in Genesis 24 trajectories and not commands
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.400]   is because God never commanded Abraham explicitly that his son must have a wife, that his wife
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.600]   could not be a Canaanitess, and that he may not return to Mesopotamia.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.400]   He never said that.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.800]   The only way Abraham could determine that, so far as we see from scripture, is by tracing
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:01.160]   out trajectories from things God did say to him in the past.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.800]   And he had said things that pointed in that direction.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.320]   God had, as it were, launched the rocket of his will.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:16.520]   And now and then he allowed the clouds at Cape Canaveral to clear for Abraham, and Abraham
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.800]   could see the kind of rocket it was, the direction it was going, and how fast it was going, and
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.680]   then the clouds came back over.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:32.560]   And Abraham was left to trace out the trajectory for his own behavior from what God had revealed
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.720]   of the rocket's path and nature.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.220]   So following the trajectory of God's will for us and his revealed word gives us confidence
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.120]   in our daily decision making.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.520]   So we will only make good decisions in life to the degree that we follow the trajectory
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.480]   of God's revealed will to us in his word.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   And as Pastor John goes on to state a little bit later in the sermon, "The reason there
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.560]   are church people who are basically secular, like everyone else, except with a religious
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.880]   veneer is that they devote 99% of their time absorbing the trajectories of the world and
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.760]   1% of their time absorbing the trajectories of the word."
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.880]   So that's the flip side of this principle.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:21.760]   So it's in seeing the trajectories of God's revealed word that enable us to make confident
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   real life decisions.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.280]   This clip is from his sermon.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.560]   It's titled, "He Will Send His Angels Before You," preached on August 8th, 1982.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.600]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.920]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.280]   the audio, and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.400]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.320]   Well speaking of following God's will, what do we do when we cannot do everything?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.820]   How do we prioritize a busy life?
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.820]   That's up next time.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reike, and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.520]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   [END]
