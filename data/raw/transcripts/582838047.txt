[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   Hi, my name is Beatrice.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   I like to go by B, but yeah, just if you see me, I might forget to respond to Beatrice.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   But yeah, this is my testimony.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.320]   I've attended church from an early age.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.640]   My parents were active in the church, so growing up there was seldom a free Sunday morning.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.280]   The first time I can recall hearing the gospel message was when I was seven years old during
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   a gospel presentation at VBS.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.200]   On the surface, I understood the gospel story and desired to grow in my knowledge of God
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.720]   and his role as my Lord and Savior.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   However, I didn't understand the depths of my sin.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.720]   My desire was merely to be a good child.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.640]   My definition of good was performative as it came from the ways that others view me
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.680]   and would describe me.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.400]   It wasn't really hard for me to modify my actions to look that way.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.720]   It wasn't until the eighth grade that the gospel became more than a story to me.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.760]   Since the fourth grade, I had no concern over the sins of my tongue and profanity ran rampant
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.880]   in my everyday speech.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.960]   It was used to express the unloving thoughts that I had.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.200]   In Ephesians 4, Paul wrote about the life that believers are called to live.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.240]   Verse 29 says, "Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.440]   word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that so that it will give
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520]   grace to those who hear."
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.120]   When I compared the way that I lived my life to what God desired, I realized that I had
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.760]   fallen short of his command.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   Recalling the gospel message that I had previously heard countless times, I finally saw my sin
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.720]   as a personal offense against God.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.200]   I saw that I was completely at his mercy, and in his mercy, he also gifted me grace
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160]   through Jesus' death on the cross.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   I saw that it was only by the blood that Jesus shed that my sins could be atoned for, that
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.600]   God's wrath could be satisfied, and I could still live.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.200]   This is when I began to make active efforts to live my life in a manner that was pleasing
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.320]   and acceptable to God.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.960]   Since then, God has continued to do his good work in sanctifying me.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.640]   Following my conversion, I took great pride in my ability to continue to conform to outward
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   standards of what a Christian looked like.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.000]   God graciously revealed my self-reliant and pride attitude in the clearest way during
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   college.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.440]   The bold and unapologetic preaching, coupled with constant accountability and investment,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.280]   were all means of loving discipline from my Heavenly Father.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.580]   Though my sin has been paid for and I am seen righteous before God because I am covered
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.080]   by Christ's blood, I still have many sinful habits that I must work to kill through the
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.520]   enabling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:32.560]   Today, I publicly confess and recognize the innateness of my sin, the inability to turn
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.280]   from it out of my own accord, and the never-ending need for Christ to successfully maintain my
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   relationship with God.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.160]   I was previously baptized during my freshman year of high school in 2014 through the mode
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.640]   of sprinkling.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.720]   It wasn't until I came to Brewery Inn that I was both challenged and encouraged to form
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.200]   a personal conviction regarding the ordinance of baptism.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.160]   After a year and a half of studying, having conversations, and praying, I desired to be
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.320]   fully and completely obedient to His command given through His Word because my life is
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.080]   no longer lived for myself but for Him.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.960]   I recognize that His command is to participate in baptism through immersion.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.920]   I have seen that His Lordship over my life constitutes every aspect of it, not only the
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   spiritual.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.040]   So I am being baptized here today as a means of displaying my heart's desire to obey and
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.560]   please my God who has been faithful, persistent, and patient in His pursuit after me and continues
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.120]   to be as He works to sanctify me.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   Thank you.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   [Applause]
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   >> All right.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   We are going to be taking a few minutes to pray.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120]   So if you would like to join me in prayer, I would like to invite you to come to the
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   front of the room and to stand in the center of the room.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.120]   I would like to invite you to stand in the center of the room and to pray.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120]   of the room.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center of
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   the room.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center of
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   the room.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center of
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   the room.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center of
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   the room.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   I would like to invite you to come to the front of the room and to stand in the center
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:28.280]   of the room.
