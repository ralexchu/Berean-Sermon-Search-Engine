[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be reading from
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.360]   verse 14 up to verse 17.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.160]   Our focus will be on verse 16 and 17, but I want to read it in context.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.960]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 14 through 17.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:33.840]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:01:02.040]   Let's pray.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.400]   Heavenly Father, we pray that you would guard this pulpit, Lord God, that only your word
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.840]   would go forth.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.360]   I pray, Father God, that your word that you have ordained would convict our hearts, cause
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   us to be sanctified in a greater and clearer vision of Christ, that we would live and invest
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000]   in eternal things, Lord God, not for temporary.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.440]   So open our eyes, soften our hearts, our ears, that we may hear and understand and be convicted.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.320]   May your word be honored this morning.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.120]   Alright, so the text that we were looking at is verse 14 and 15, the previous weeks.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.280]   It was given to us in the context of encouraging and also warning us that no one missed the
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.200]   grace of God.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.400]   And so we looked at last week how the grace of God can be missed by people who are not
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.880]   believers who reject the truth.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.660]   Grace of God can be missed by a nominal Christian who believes or at least accepted the cultural
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.080]   Christianity without really having faith.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.840]   Or even for genuine Christians who are just fatigued and is thinking about quitting or
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.600]   taking a break to not miss the grace of God and to continue to strive after God.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.920]   And so we've been given examples in chapter 11 about what that perseverance looks like.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.400]   The cloud of witnesses that have gone before us who lived a life of faith and because of
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.240]   their faith they lived courageously.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.880]   Some of them who experienced great joy, great fruit, and some of them who were martyred
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   for their faith.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.120]   And all of them as an example of what it means to persevere in their faith.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.400]   This morning we're looking at verse 16 and 17 with all the examples that are given us,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.160]   the positive examples that are given us in chapter 11.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   We're given one example in chapter 12 of what not to do.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.360]   Of Esau's example when he says that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.320]   who sold his own birthright for a single meal.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.840]   And that one particular act is highlighted above all the things that are mentioned in
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   chapter 11 as what not to do.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.440]   So I know that some of us, you know, we have people that we may have looked up to in the
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   past or even currently.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.360]   It's like that's the kind of life that we want.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.080]   Whether they are, you know, people in ministry or somebody who's really committed their life
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.480]   to you in small group or discipled you.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.940]   My guess is that you also have people that have gone before you that you've told yourself
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.760]   at some point, it's like I'm not going to turn out like that.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560]   They may have been people who actually said that they were going to go into full-time
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.800]   ministry at one point.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.160]   Maybe they were your leaders at one point.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.440]   But they are no longer walking with Christ.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.020]   And so whether it is a positive example or a negative example, they are given to us in
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.880]   order that we may learn from.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.960]   And so Esau's example here, he says that his sin is something that we ought to learn from
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   because in verse 17 he says, "For you know that even afterwards when he desired to inherit
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.540]   the blessing, he was rejected.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.640]   For he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears."
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.000]   So we want to look at this morning, what is it about Esau's sin that is so hideous that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.300]   in verse 16 that it is called immoral and it's called godless?
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.940]   And that even when he wanted to repent, he said God rejected it.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.960]   What was it about what he did that above all the cloud of witnesses, his single act is
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.660]   highlighted for us saying that do not be like Esau, immoral, godless, who could not repent.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.480]   Just in case that maybe we missed something in Genesis.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.200]   So let's go back and take a look in Genesis chapter 25, 28-34 because this particular
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.820]   event that is highlighted for us where he forsook his birthright is mentioned in these
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.820]   few verses.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.280]   So I want you to take a look at it so that we'll know what we're talking about when
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.600]   we're expositing this text.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.200]   Verse 28 it says, "Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.060]   loved Jacob.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now when Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.760]   And Esau said to Jacob, 'Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   famished.'
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280]   Therefore his name was called Edom."
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.800]   Up to that point it just sounds like any other family, right?
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.680]   You had an older brother who likes to go out hunting, like manly man, right?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.480]   He's the guy who likes to do guy stuff.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.400]   And then Jacob stayed home and cooked.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.960]   Nothing wrong with cooking, but it's just highlighting for us that that's a distinction.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.340]   And then the father favored the son, right?
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.840]   And then the mother favored Jacob, the other son.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.360]   He comes back and so this is the event that caused the course of history for these two
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   families.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.120]   Verse 13, "But Jacob said, 'First sell me your birthright.'"
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   Right?
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.640]   I mean, this guy's a schemer, right?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.840]   He's like, "I'll give you some stew, but give me your inheritance."
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   Right?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.640]   Now, if Esau was a smart guy, he would have responded by saying, "My whole inheritance
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   for a bowl of soup?"
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.720]   But he says in verse 32, "Behold, I am about to die."
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   A little drama.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   "I am about to die."
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.600]   So what use then is the birthright to me?
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   That's it.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.840]   The course of these two families' history changes because of this particular event.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.080]   He came in, he was hungry, his younger brother was scheming with his mom so that he can have
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   the birthright.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.360]   The birthright basically at that time was the oldest son would get two-thirds of the
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.320]   inheritance and then the other parts of it would be divided among the other siblings.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.360]   That was it.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.080]   And all it was was a change of birthright where Jacob would get the two-thirds and Esau
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.600]   would get the other.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.840]   And it was simply because of this.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.240]   He was so hungry, he said he was about to die and what good is my birthright?
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.400]   In other words, you can have my birthright.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.440]   What good is that to me?
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.760]   That's coming down the road.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.120]   And Jacob said, "First swear to me."
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.360]   So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   So I want you to understand culturally that in our culture, unless it's signed on paper
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.600]   and you have a witness and then it's filed somewhere and the money is transferred and
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   the bank says it's in, it's not complete.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.320]   If you're buying a house, unless the money is wired in and everything is complete, it's
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   not done.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   Right?
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.920]   Escrow is not finished.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.000]   At this particular time in the oral tradition, the promise in and of itself, the oath in
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.200]   and of itself was like a completed contract.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.080]   This wasn't unique to Israelites.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.920]   This is how they functioned.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:11.040]   And so Jacob knew and Esau knew that the moment that he said, "Okay, I swear to you," that
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   was legally binding contract.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.280]   Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew and he ate and drank and rose and went on
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   his way.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   And Esau despised his birthright.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   That's it.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   Everything that he's warning us about, verse 16 and 17, is based upon this particular event.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   He was hungry.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.200]   "I'm about to die.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   What good is my birthright?
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   Swear to me.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   I swear to you."
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   The end.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.680]   And then course of history has changed because of that.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.040]   That was immoral.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's how it's described here.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.840]   Do not be like Esau, who is immoral and godless.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.480]   That was immoral and godless.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.360]   What is it that we're missing here?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.280]   Because we can look at this event and say, "Oh, I could see any one of us doing that."
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.440]   What good is my birthright?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.180]   What good is my future inheritance?
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.360]   And at that moment, you're famished and maybe say, "Oh, I'm about to die."
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.560]   Maybe that's exaggerated.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.040]   But how often do we say, "Well, what good is this?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.640]   What good is commitment to church?
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.400]   What good is the covenant?
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.000]   I got to feed my kids.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.120]   I got a deadline.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.040]   I'm too busy.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.540]   What about my retirement?
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.540]   What about this?"
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:37.280]   How often do we say ... We don't say no, but it's just not that important right now.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   It will be important.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   I know it's important, but as of right now, it's not that important.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:49.840]   How often do we postpone or reject God's promises in our lives simply because of the things
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.440]   that are urgent at that moment?
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.480]   And yet, God looks at this event and he says, "This was an immoral act.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.280]   It was a godless act."
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.600]   First of all, in order to understand what's going on, we have to understand the context
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   of this.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.400]   That in a typical family, the firstborn, we get two-thirds of the inheritance, but this
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.120]   is no typical family.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.440]   You have to remember, Abraham was already a rich man when God called him out of the
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   Ur of Chaldeans.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   He risked everything because God made a promise to him in Genesis that if you come out and
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.520]   follow me and trust me and go out into this wilderness, I will bless you.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.880]   Your descendants are going to outnumber the sands and the stars.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.400]   I'm going to give you this land and I'm going to bless you so that you may be a blessing
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.160]   to all the other nations.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.080]   Now, that is described in Genesis chapter 12, verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.040]   And if you continue to read the book of Genesis, you'll see that revelation, that covenant
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.200]   is clarified even further that God's intention wasn't simply for Israel.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.600]   That that promise is really a promise for mankind, that God was going to establish what
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.760]   he was going to establish through them for the salvation of mankind itself.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   So the covenant promise, this birthright that he is talking about, is that promise that
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.800]   he gave to Abraham.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.080]   And it's that promise that he held onto, that he was even willing to sacrifice Abraham's
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.120]   son Isaac, and then God stops him at the very end and says, "Do not do that, for God will
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   provide."
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.080]   All pointing to how God was going to fulfill this promise in Christ.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.040]   And so now, this birthright he's referring to is that covenant promise that's being passed
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.520]   down from generation to generation to generation.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.920]   So when he says, "What good is this birthright to me when I'm about to die because I'm so
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.400]   hungry," he's not simply rejecting money.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.560]   He's rejecting God's covenant promise that his whole generational family was based on.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.360]   If wealth was what they were pursuing, they could have packed up and just went back home.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.780]   They could have just went back home because they were already wealthy.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.360]   Why risk being out in the wilderness marching where there's fortified cities, where there's
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.720]   Egypt and the Canaanites, who's much stronger than them, can easily crush them if that was
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.560]   their pursuit.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.480]   They risked everything simply because God promised them that through them, that through
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.320]   their blessing, that it was going to overflow to the nations.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.560]   Now do you think that Esau and Jacob knew about that?
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.840]   I can almost guarantee that this was probably talked about in that family constantly.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.080]   Every time they misbehaved, it was like, "Do you not know the covenant promise?"
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:40.560]   I think this was passed on every family gathering, every Bible study, every festival.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.640]   My guess is this was repeated constantly.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.040]   So it wasn't like Esau was not aware.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.520]   So when he says, "What good is this birthright," he's saying, "What good is God's covenant
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   promise to me?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.040]   What good is God to me when I'm hungry now?"
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.840]   Think about how often we compromise because of our immediate need, the tyranny of the
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.480]   urgent, because there's something urgent in my life right now, that this promise of following
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.920]   Christ, the promise of eternity, it just doesn't seem practical at this moment.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.200]   So much of our compromise doesn't happen because we say, "No, I don't believe you, God.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.520]   God is not important to me."
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.560]   We simply compromise and we just postponed obedience because I have something urgent
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.360]   now that I need to take care of.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.080]   From our perspective, we can look at that and say, "Well, I can easily see myself in
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.240]   that situation."
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   And I'm sure many of you can see that.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   But from God's perspective, He describes at the end of verse 34, "Thus Esau despised
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.160]   his birthright."
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.600]   He didn't simply chose to eat.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.400]   He said he despised it.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.960]   He didn't recognize the weightiness of what it is that he had.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.560]   And he just threw it away.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.400]   He didn't say, "I don't believe you, God."
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.240]   He didn't take God's covenant and say, "I don't believe you.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   I don't trust this.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   I'm going to choose to love the world."
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.280]   He didn't say that.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.700]   He just simply said, "Right now, what good is it?
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.700]   Right now?"
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:21.040]   Yeah, in eternity, yes, but right now, this is what's urgent.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.440]   Drifting in apostasy doesn't happen because we hate God.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.520]   Drifting in apostasy happens simply because we value something more urgent today than
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.360]   the promises God has made for us in eternity.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.600]   So it's not something that, for most people, they consciously choose.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.960]   It's out of neglect.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.120]   It's out of just drifting.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.440]   That's why it may seem like it's something innocent, but from God's perspective, He didn't
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.520]   just reject anything.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.160]   He rejected God Himself.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.280]   And so the warning that we are given through Esau's example is probably one of the most
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.360]   practical advice that we can get.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.160]   How often we talk about, "I want to be a better Christian."
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.920]   What does that mean?
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:15.200]   We talk about if somebody came and put a gun to your head and said, "If you don't deny
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.360]   Jesus, you're going to get shot," and then we fantasize about what we would do in that
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.200]   situation, I'm not sure.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:28.400]   And we think about a scenario that probably isn't going to happen to 99.99999% of us.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.440]   And somehow we hang our hats on these big picture things like, "If we're persecuted,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.600]   if they came in with the guns and said, 'If you don't deny Jesus, we're going to kill
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:43.080]   you,' I wonder what I would do in that situation," which is probably never going to happen.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:49.520]   We might get made fun of, maybe lose our tactics and status, the way that things are going
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   right now.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.460]   I mean, there are a lot of crazy things that are happening in our country right now.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:01.440]   But the practical stuff, where the rubber meets the road, is the example of Esau.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:08.120]   It's not the guns, it's not the military, it's not the militants, it's not the terrorists,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.540]   it's the day-to-day constant temptation of choosing what satisfies our flesh versus the
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.680]   promises of God.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.760]   The tyranny of what is urgent.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.240]   Let me show you this chart, which I've shown before, but I think this is one of the most
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:32.040]   helpful things that I learned when I was younger about different categories of priority.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.220]   Everything in our life falls into one of these categories.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.800]   The first category is important and urgent.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.120]   Important and urgent things are kind of like work, pay bills, school.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.840]   If you're not good at this stuff, you're going to fail in life.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   You're going to get fired.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   You're not going to be able to graduate school.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   This is what makes you an adult.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.680]   Somewhere between high school and out of college, you realize, "Oh, shoot, I better get this
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.480]   right."
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.400]   There's some of you who are in that category right now, where you're not good at that,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.040]   but you better be because if you're not good at this, you're homeless, basically.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.720]   The only reason you're not homeless is because your parents are covering you for that period.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.840]   But once you get out of that period, if you become an adult, this is important and urgent.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.240]   You have to pay your bills.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.400]   You have to go to work.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.840]   You don't just wake up one day and say, "I don't feel like going to work."
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.640]   Then you're fired.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.960]   There's nothing in between.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.640]   The second category is not important, but urgent.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.320]   These are things that you made urgent.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.840]   You're in a softball tournament and you chose to be the captain of the team.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   You have to organize.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.880]   You have to collect the money.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   You have to call them.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   You have to make sure everybody's together.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.800]   You have to go to practice.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.960]   It became urgent because you took on that responsibility for yourself, but it's not
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   important.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.480]   If you fail in that category, you're just a flake.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.520]   If you're not good in the first category, you're a bum.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.720]   If you fail in the second category, you're a flake.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.040]   But it's not going to ruin your life.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   You're just going to have a bad reputation if you're not good at it.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.160]   If you are a responsible human being, you'll be good at that too.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.840]   Don't volunteer for things that you're not going to carry out.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.480]   Then you have the not important, not urgent.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.360]   Those are the time wasters.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.920]   Those are when you become the local champion of some video game.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.560]   You know everything about Lakers.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.200]   What shoe size that all the players play.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.880]   You joined fantasy football and you're dedicated 30 hours of your week to win whatever that
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   is.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.280]   Those are not important.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.520]   Maybe it's urgent, but not it.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.200]   Those are time wasters.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.480]   You play video games and your wife is always complaining and they have the right to complain
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.160]   because you're wasting time.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.560]   You're not a good father.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.280]   You're not a good husband if you spend too much time on this.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.960]   It's not sinful, but usually when you're tired and you're busy, you end up doing that to
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.760]   kind of kill time.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.240]   These are time killers, time wasters.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   You don't have to feel guilty.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.720]   It's like, "Oh, I watched a movie.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.080]   I'm such a sinner."
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.880]   It's not sin.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.440]   But those are things that really don't matter.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.840]   There's nothing in that category at the end of your life you're going to regret.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.720]   "Oh, I wish I could have gone to the next level.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   One more year.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.360]   I didn't get to finish season seven of The Office.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   One more year.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   I could have done it."
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.040]   Those are things that wouldn't matter.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.840]   The things that you're going to look back and wish you had more time or to reprioritize
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.680]   are all in the last category, important but not urgent.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   These are the things at the end of the year when you evaluate and say, "I'm going to have
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.160]   my New Year's resolution," it's usually in that category.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.880]   Usually it's in that order.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.560]   If you ask most Christians, "What's the most important thing?"
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.800]   Whether you genuinely believe it or just know the right answer, you'll say, "God," because
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.160]   you've been taught that.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.240]   Or maybe that's actually what you believe.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.520]   And then you'll say, "Family."
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.840]   Family is second.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.240]   And then maybe you'll say, "Church," if you have your right theology.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.720]   And then after that, you'll say, "Friends."
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.820]   Then after that, you'll say, "Myself," or "Health," or whatever that may be.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.360]   But these are all things that are not urgent.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.340]   You don't see immediate consequence if you neglect this stuff.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.920]   Not immediately.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.800]   But the greatest consequences come from this area when you neglect it.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.120]   Greatest consequences.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:48.440]   But because it's not urgent, what ends up happening is we live by whatever is urgent.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   And so what's urgent is in the first category.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.000]   What's urgent is in the second category.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.660]   And then we feel guilty about the third category.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.720]   And then by the time we get to the fourth category, we don't have time.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.800]   Sad to say, so many people live in this manner, and then a year, 10 years, 30 years go by,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.120]   and they say, looking back at their life, "I wish I spent more time investing in this."
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.520]   And it is almost always in that category.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.920]   Important but not urgent.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.320]   Now why do I share this?
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.360]   Because that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.440]   When we talk about following Christ, and I want to be a great Christian, what does that
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.940]   mean?
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.080]   If persecution comes, like what am I going to do?
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.720]   These are all hypotheticals.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:44.600]   But the reality is, in the way you spend your time, in the way you spend your money, does
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.120]   it reflect your priorities?
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.800]   Does it reflect the things that you say are the most important in your life?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:59.560]   Or does that always end up being like if the situation is perfect, if I have all the time
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.360]   in the world?
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.000]   The reason why Esau's example is so practical is because this is what we struggle with on
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.360]   a day-to-day basis.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.880]   We don't struggle with militants.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.320]   We don't struggle with terrorists.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   Even with all the crazy things that's going on with the government, and on July 4th, we
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:25.200]   have the freedom to be able to make choices and vote and participate in civil things.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.340]   All of these things are the privileges that we have living in this country.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:34.120]   But the thing that where the rubber meets the road, where you struggle today, is what
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   Esau struggles with.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:44.160]   What good is God's promises when I have to pay my bills?
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:51.520]   What good is eternity when right now I have to find a job?
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:23:00.360]   What good is giving glory to God if right now I have struggles with relationships?
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:06.840]   And so this tyranny of the urgent is what causes people to drift, neglect, and then
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.080]   wake up one day realizing that they don't believe anymore.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:18.760]   Their hearts have become so hardened away from God that they no longer feel anything.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.240]   And they're not even sure about their faith.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.160]   And it didn't happen overnight.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   It was day after day, week after week, month after month of choosing what satisfies our
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.280]   flesh today versus living for eternity.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.160]   There's a reason why this act is called immoral.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:45.880]   You know what's interesting is immoral in Greek is pornea, where we get the word pornography.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   And it literally means sexual immorality.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:55.080]   So in the ESV, in the NIV, it actually says, "Do not be like Esau who committed sexual
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   immorality."
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.000]   Which is strange because there's nothing sexual about what happened.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.920]   It's between two brothers.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.200]   And it's about this stew.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.280]   How is that called sexual immorality?
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:14.480]   Well the word for pornea here, although it encompasses sexual immorality, literally it
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.240]   means to prostitute yourself for something else.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.680]   So it is used in the context of prostituting, whether you're watching pornography or you're
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.920]   engaged in something sexual or immoral, you're using your body and giving it to something
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.040]   that you shouldn't give it to.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.520]   That's what that word literally means.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.360]   So it includes sex.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   But the broader understanding is to sell yourself to something that you should not.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   And that's how the word is used, the idea is used in the book of Hosea.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   When God describes Hosea's rebellion against God, he uses basically an adulterous gomer.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:00.760]   And Hosea is called to love her and continue to chase after her while she prostitutes herself,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.200]   while she gives herself to other idols.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   And so that's what he's saying here is that Esau prostituted himself for a bowl of soup.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:17.200]   He gave this birthright that God gave to his family in order for the salvation of mankind.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.960]   But his answer was, "What good is it when today I need this soup?"
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.920]   Today.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.240]   You know what's also interesting is the next word that he uses is godless, immoral and
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.320]   godless.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.560]   In some translations it'll say profane or unholy.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.480]   You know what that word literally means?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.240]   That word literally means to be outside the temple.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.280]   It's a very visual word.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:49.560]   To be outside the temple means that in his act, in his immorality, in choosing what is
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:57.240]   urgent now versus the promises of eternity, he placed himself outside of the temple.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.560]   So the temple represented God's blessing.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.120]   Temple represented where people would come to meet God, give sacrifices, to give worship,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.680]   to pray.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:15.160]   And so when he chose his flesh over the promise, he physically removed himself from God's blessing.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.580]   That's what this means.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.400]   And that's why he said they use the word unholy or profane or godless because that which is
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.860]   holy was meant to be in the temple.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.480]   And he removed himself from there from the blessing of God.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.200]   The safest and the happiest place for every Christian is to be at the center of the will
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.620]   of God.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.260]   Because God is the author of life.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.340]   And so his imperatives in the New Testament aren't simply to test us to see so that we
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.600]   can be better soldiers for the kingdom.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   All the commandments of God that is given to us is because that's exactly where the
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.100]   greatest joy is.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.800]   When he tells us to be faithful, it is in faithfulness where we find the greatest satisfaction,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   greatest joy.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.320]   It is in sacrifice.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.740]   That's why when he says to pick up our cross if we want to follow him, he's not saying
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.380]   suffer and die and have hardship in life if you want to follow me.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.860]   He says no, because through this path is where you're going to find your life.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.840]   And the greatest hindrance to true life is our own flesh, where we convince ourselves
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   that if our pride, if our flesh is satisfied, if we can have some of the stuff that the
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.800]   world gives.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.760]   And so we try to lift ourselves up.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.200]   Everything about the secular life is to improve ourselves to be better.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.000]   Isn't it?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.960]   Even in the church.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.640]   If it's a small church, we have to have a bigger church.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.060]   If we have a bigger church, we need to have a bigger platform.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.480]   If we wrote one book, we have to write many books.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.560]   And so we apply the same temptation outside the world and we bring it into the church
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.680]   and it is our own flesh that we feed if we're not careful.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.200]   And so what God's calling, said if you do not deny yourself, the thing that's going
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.640]   to stumble you the rest of your life is yourself.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.240]   Before the government, before what's happening out there, it's our own desire to satisfy
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.160]   our own flesh that is the greatest hindrance to God's greatest blessing.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:21.600]   So the first and greatest thing that he calls us to do is to die to ourself, to die to ourself.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:31.200]   He who finds his life will lose it and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.320]   Such a simple statement, but so profound.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.880]   I don't know how many times I've done quiet time and go through passages going back to
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.080]   that, but that's what he meant when he said that.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.000]   Oh, that's what he meant when he said that, to die to ourselves.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.120]   That's what he means when he says Esau, when he chose his flesh over God's covenant promise,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.360]   he removed himself from God's blessing.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.040]   That's why in James chapter four, verse four, it says, "You adulterous, do you not know
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.120]   friendship with the world is hostility toward God?"
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.400]   You notice the extreme words that he uses here?
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.400]   He said friendship with the world.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   He didn't say it's not recommended.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.320]   He didn't say friendship with the world is probably not good for you.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   He said it's hostility.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   Hostility.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.440]   Can you imagine?
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   He said if you are trying hard to function in this world and be somebody in this world,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.840]   you say you end up being hostile toward God.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.600]   He goes on further, he said, "Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.200]   an enemy of God."
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.400]   Think about where you and I are today.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.560]   In our generation, with again, and I'm going to say this again, with the seeker-friendly,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.740]   market-driven type of ministry, where the primary thing is how can we get non-Christians
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.400]   to feel comfortable and welcomed in the church?
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.680]   Desire to win non-believers to Christ is noble.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.920]   Desire to make the gospel clear is noble.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.720]   But to think that somehow we're going to be in friendly terms with the world, he says,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.240]   it is you become an enemy of God.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.440]   The world and its passions are passing away.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.680]   The God of this age is Satan, who is directly in contradiction to what God desires.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.760]   So how can we mix Satan's desires and God's desires, and somehow we think that we're going
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.560]   to somehow live in the middle?
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.240]   He says, no.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:41.840]   Even the desire to be friends of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.000]   First John 2.16, it says, "For all that is in the world, lust of the flesh."
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.240]   You notice that the first thing that he mentions is lust of the flesh?
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.680]   It's not by accident that Jesus' first temptation in the wilderness is to turn the stone into
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   bread, because Jesus was hungry.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   After 40 days of fasting, he said, "Give that up.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   Turn it into bread."
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.920]   He was trying to tempt him with his flesh, just like Esau.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.000]   And then he says, "The lust of the eyes."
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.520]   If you remember, Satan takes him up to the temple, and then he shows the world, and he
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.320]   says, "If you would bow down to me, I will give you all of this," which is a ridiculous
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.160]   proposition since he knows that Jesus Christ is his creator.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.740]   But for the very first time, Jesus took on humanity, and he looked frail.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:38.240]   The God who created the universe took on frail humanity, and so if there was any time that
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.440]   Satan thought that he may have a chance to usurp his glory was probably at that time,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.920]   and he says, "Well, I'll give you all of this, lust of the eyes."
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.800]   And then the boastful pride of life.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.040]   He says, "Jump off this temple."
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   The Bible says that the angels are going to catch you.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.560]   If you really are the Son of God, they're going to catch you.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.480]   These three things, lust of the flesh, what's immediate now, lust of the eyes, the things
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.240]   that you see, right?
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.120]   And this usually happens when you're younger.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.920]   You look at the world and you think that every single person in this room who are under the
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:19.320]   age of 60 are potential millionaires.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.600]   People go through a midlife crisis because they realize that potential is probably dead.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:30.040]   It's just like, "Well, if I didn't become a millionaire by now, the odds are you're
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.760]   not going to be a millionaire."
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:38.240]   But when you're 20, how often, even in the church, you say, "My goal is by the time I'm
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.960]   30, I'm going to become a millionaire."
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.200]   Some of you are probably thinking that now.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.680]   By the time I'm 30, I'm going to buy some cryptocurrency.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.480]   This is going to go to a million dollars.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.680]   And you're just investing, you're watching, and you're doing all of this stuff because
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.720]   my goal is, of course, for God's glory.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   I'm going to feed the poor.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   Don't worry about it.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.360]   When I become a billionaire, I'll tithe.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.840]   Don't worry about it.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.600]   Lust of the eyes, we're coveting things that the world has and not knowing that your heart
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.800]   is where your treasure is, your mind and your heart, your time, your energy, your money,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.840]   all being spent because of the lust of the eyes, because of things that are coming.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.740]   And then when you get a little bit older and you're somewhat successful, you kind of pass
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:34.360]   the midlife crisis age and boastful pride of life where your reputation is everything,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.960]   your experience, your age, what you've accomplished, and then pride creeps in.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.080]   And so you work hard to maintain your status.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.240]   When you're young, the temptation is that you might miss out if you're too serious.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:54.320]   If I make these decisions, if I do this and don't do this, I might not get this.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.880]   But when we're older, the temptation is actually the opposite.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   If we do this, if we do that, I might lose this, whether it's money or our reputation
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.800]   or whatever it is that we have established.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:13.680]   Boastful pride of life, these are all hooks that Satan uses to draw us away from him.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.580]   So it is not this big picture like if the world came in, if the terrorists came in and
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.760]   forced us, like, "What am I going to do?"
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.440]   I mean, that's entertaining to think about, but it's probably not going to happen.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:34.160]   But where the rubber meets the road is today, tomorrow, next week.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.960]   Is Christ more important than your job?
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.880]   Do you trust Christ with your children?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.480]   Is Christ's covenant relationship, the promises that he made, more important than your bills,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.240]   more important than your job?
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.520]   That's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.200]   The saddest people in the church are the people who are the closest to God's covenant grace
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.040]   and to just miss it.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:11.300]   This is why where you and I are is so, so, so dangerous.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.720]   Because out in India, where there is real persecution, Christians and non-Christians
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:23.360]   are not difficult to see, because there are serious consequences for following Christ.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.840]   There are certain parts of the world that you literally risk your life to get to church
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.700]   and enjoy fellowship.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.800]   In North Korea, you can get executed by just owning a Bible.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.320]   But the danger that you and I live in is we live in a post-Christian culture where it
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.420]   is difficult for us to determine who is and is not a Christian, even in the church, even
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:48.480]   in leadership, even from the pulpit.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   Because of that, the deception is if we look like everybody else and we're jumping through
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.520]   the hoops like everybody else in our culture, we just assume that we're in the grace of
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.320]   God.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:09.600]   We need to test our faith by the plumb line of the word of God, not by our culture, not
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.440]   by people that you respect, not by people with great reputation, not by people who have
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.660]   big churches and wrote a lot of books.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.400]   We need to test with the plumb line of God's word.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:29.120]   You need to test it, and I need to test it, to make sure that you and I are not compromised,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:35.320]   that we did not walk outside the temple, that we did not give ourselves to something.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.840]   But because we're in a post-Christian culture, there's no consequence.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.800]   So it is that he is warning against.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.920]   All the positive examples that are given in chapter 11, one example that is given in Esau
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.960]   is that is the example, is the greatest example, because the greatest number of people fall
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.840]   away from Christ for that.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.280]   More than a gun to our head, more than the government, more than anything else, it's
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:13.040]   just a simple temptation to satisfy our flesh over the promises of God.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:21.280]   More people will stand in the judgment seat who thought that they were Christians because
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:27.880]   they simply followed the culture of the church.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.640]   What does 17 mean?
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.480]   For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.760]   for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it for tears.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.840]   Why couldn't he repent?
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.000]   Is that a particular sin that God has pointed out and said, "If you reject this covenant,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.320]   then you can't repent."
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.840]   Why couldn't he repent?
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.680]   Is he saying that all other sins you can repent of, but this particular sin you can't?
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.400]   If you look at it, he says, what did he desire?
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.080]   What was his repentance about?
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.000]   He desired to inherit the blessing.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   That's what he was repenting.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.560]   He regretted what he did.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.520]   He wasn't saying that God says, God's not telling him, "Oh, you can't be my child.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   I'll never hear your praises."
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.600]   No, what he was repenting of was that particular act because what he regretted was, "I can't
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.680]   believe I let go of that and I wanted the inheritance back," and he couldn't get the
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.200]   inheritance back.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.960]   That's what he means.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.980]   Because at that particular time, he knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.100]   And he swore.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.100]   It wasn't a mistake.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.120]   He wasn't deceived.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.600]   We just think, "Oh, he was just an innocent guy who just went out hunting and came out
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.840]   tired and he got deceived.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.600]   He had all the best intentions."
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.280]   No, he knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.640]   But at that moment, the stew was more important than his birthright.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.700]   And as a result, he couldn't reverse that.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.440]   What does this teach us?
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:58.000]   If you look at the book of Hebrews, we are told over and over again today, if you hear
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.240]   his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.800]   Hebrews chapter 3, 7-8, "Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you hear
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.160]   his voice, do not harden your heart, as when they provoked me.'"
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.080]   Again, verse 13 and 15, chapter 3, "But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.840]   called today, so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sins, for
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.960]   we have become partakers of Christ.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.700]   If we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end, while it is said, 'Today,
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.960]   if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart, as when they provoked me.'"
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.720]   Again in chapter 4, verse 7, "He again fixes a certain day, 'Today,' saying through David,
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.680]   'After so long a time, just as he has been said before, 'Today, if you hear his voice,
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.920]   do not harden your heart.'"
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.280]   Over and over again, today, today, today.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.400]   Most people who drift away from Christ never say no.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.080]   They understand enough to say no means to reject God.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.400]   I'm not rejecting God.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.280]   It's just not today.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.720]   Not today.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.280]   I know it's important, but not today.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.160]   I know I need to give my life to Christ, but not today.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.720]   Not realizing it is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:14.960]   When you hear the voice of God, through the revelation of Christ, it is the kindness of
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   God that causes you to understand.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.200]   It is the kindness of God that illumines us, that at that particular moment, he leads you
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.560]   to repentance.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:29.280]   But if you harden your heart at that moment, you may understand the revelation tomorrow,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.520]   but there may be no illumination.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.760]   It says that the conviction of our sins come from the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.480]   The Holy Spirit comes, he said, he convicts the world of sin.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.960]   The Holy Spirit may be convicting today, but tomorrow when you hear your voice, you hear
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.880]   the revelation and the information, but you no longer have the illumination and the power
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.320]   of the Holy Spirit drawing you to Christ.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.000]   God is not somebody who you can just shelve and say, "When I'm ready, I will come."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.600]   And that's why he says, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart."
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   Today.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.440]   Because God's kindness is today.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.920]   God's mercy is today.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.720]   There's an urgency when you hear the voice today, not to postpone it until tomorrow.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.200]   There's so many people who walked away from their faith, not because they rejected Christ,
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.640]   but because they said, "Tomorrow, when I'm ready, when I'm out of college, when my kids
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.360]   are a little bit older, when I get a job, when my bills are paid, when I'm a little
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.240]   bit healthier, tomorrow."
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.920]   And then they wake up tomorrow realizing the Holy Spirit is no longer convicting them.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.840]   The kindness of God that leads us to repentance is today.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.300]   There is a time appointed for all things under heaven, Ecclesiastes chapter 3, 1-4.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.820]   There is an appointed time for everything, and there is a time for every event under
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   heaven.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.780]   A time to give birth, a time to die, a time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.460]   A time to kill, a time to heal, a time to tear down, a time to build up, a time to weep,
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.340]   and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.340]   And it goes on and on.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.460]   So there's a time.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.820]   There's God's appointed time.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.860]   God's appointed time to commit.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.980]   You know, there's a period when you're young, it's time to study.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.860]   If you miss that period, it's hard to go back.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.380]   There's a time God has appointed for us to rest at night, and if you don't sleep during
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.620]   that time, it's hard to rest during the day.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.740]   There's a time that God has appointed.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:34.140]   And that's why he says, "When you hear his voice today, do not harden your heart."
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.980]   You know, this particular section of Scripture in Ecclesiastes was put into song back in
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.420]   the '60s.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.820]   The birds.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.700]   You have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.580]   This is even before my era, because it came out in the '60s.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.620]   So I remember it being sung in the '70s, the birds.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.540]   And it says, "And Bob Dylan was a part of this band before he broke off.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:03.820]   To everything," you don't know who Bob Dylan is either, so, "To everything, turn, turn,
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.820]   turn.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.740]   There is a season, turn, turn, turn, and a time to every purpose under heaven."
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.860]   So that part is not Ecclesiastes, but the next part is, "A time to be born, time to
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.700]   die, time to plant, time to reap."
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.940]   And so basically, it's the exact verbatim of Ecclesiastes 3.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.500]   You know, what's interesting was I wanted to, I wanted to say, "What does he mean by
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   'turn, turn, turn'?"
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.500]   So I actually Googled it.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.780]   I Googled it to see, like, what did they mean?
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.860]   Well, if you know anything about Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan actually became a Christian for
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.060]   a short period of time in the '70s.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.820]   And so there's a lot of songs being, that was written during the '70s that kind of
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.060]   had a mixture of Christian theme and secular theme kind of mixing together because a lot
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:51.140]   of celebrities and musicians, rock stars, were turning to Christ during the '70s, the
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.860]   Jesus movement.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.860]   Bob Dylan was one of them.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.380]   He didn't write the song, but the interpretation was very interesting because, like, what is
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.780]   the meaning of the "turn, turn, turn"?
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:07.100]   He said that, they said that the first turn is to turn from the world, to repent.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.620]   And this is coming from the band, right?
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.140]   To turn.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:16.660]   If you hear God's voice and you are convicted, the first turn is turn.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.860]   There's an appointed season for everything.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.020]   And if you hear God's voice, turn, repent.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.340]   The second turn is the turning of the world.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:29.140]   Turning of the world meaning there are seasons.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.700]   There's summer, fall, winter, and spring.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.180]   I don't know why I couldn't remember that in the first service.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.900]   I only remembered three.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.980]   So there's seasons, things turn.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.580]   There's day, there's night.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.220]   So physically there is a turning of the earth.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:50.340]   And then just the times of, there's a period in the earth, right?
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:56.260]   There's seasons of war, seasons of peace, seasons of prosperity, seasons of poverty,
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260]   seasons of turmoil.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.660]   There's a world age, right?
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   Where there's, it's turning.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.660]   So purpose of that is in the, in different seasons as the world turns, there's period
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.500]   when you are young, period when you are old, period when your marriage is great, period
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.220]   when your marriage is difficult.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.380]   And there's seasons.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:20.420]   And so the point of that, to turn, is to recognize that God is sovereign in all of this.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.900]   That it will turn.
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.860]   Sometimes it's like this, sometimes it's like that.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.820]   But there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:32.220]   The third turn is reference to your turn will come.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.460]   It's much more personal.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.780]   This is coming from the band, describing this, what these three turns mean.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.500]   There's a season for everything under heaven.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.900]   So turn from your sins, recognize that the seasons will change and God is sovereign,
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.260]   and your turn will come.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.700]   Whatever God has ordained for you to have, it will come if God has ordained it.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.480]   Wait your turn.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:46:00.860]   But so much of our trouble gets, is we look at the world and we want our turn to be today.
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.580]   And we're afraid that we're going to miss if we don't do these things, if we don't make
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.180]   these decisions, if we don't go here and do that.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.940]   And as a result of that, instead of patiently waiting for what God gives, we are going to
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.060]   go and get it.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.180]   And as a result, we forfeit or we drift away from God.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.660]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.880]   This is in a secular song, right?
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.480]   Compared to today's song in the club.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.360]   What they do in the club, but everything's in the club, right?
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.160]   They don't make songs like this anymore, right?
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.640]   Ironically, Bob Dylan fell away from his faith, right?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.320]   He faithfully followed Christ in the seventies and then he just said, oh, that was a phase
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   in my life.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   And he drifted away.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.500]   And his very warning from this song, he did not heed himself.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:55.080]   The warning that are given to us as an example of Esau is probably the one of the most practical
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.060]   warnings that every Christian should heed.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:06.100]   Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God by doing what Esau did.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:11.220]   That we value eternity, even though we don't see it, even though it seems far away, that
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:16.420]   his promises that he has given us in eternity, that when we say we have been crucified with
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:23.060]   Christ, it is no longer we who live, that we believe that and we practice that.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.380]   The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.220]   himself for me.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.300]   So today is no longer about me.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.780]   It's no longer about my fulfillment, my pride, my pursuit.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.580]   It is him.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:42.400]   And when he comes in glory, we will be glorified with him.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.480]   So we live by faith and not by sight.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:53.500]   I pray that the word of God would penetrate our hearts beyond just theory, that we would
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.220]   apply the warning that God has given us, that we would live for eternity and not for the
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.220]   temporal.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   Let's pray.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:13.900]   Again, take some time to pray and allow the word of God to bear fruit in our hearts.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.600]   How should I be applying this?
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:23.820]   What areas of my life is God warning me and encouraging me that this needs to be applied?
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.540]   Take some time to meditate and ask the Lord to open our eyes.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   Lord search me and know me, see if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:36.220]   Is there a desire in my heart to befriend with the world?
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:42.020]   Or have I already been compromised that I need to turn and recognize that now is the
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.940]   time today?
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.780]   As our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
