[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Hi, my name is Yuri Kong, and I'm thankful to God for allowing me to share my testimony
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   with you today.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.920]   Looking back at my life, I'm so thankful to have grown up in the faith, mainly because
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.880]   of my mom, who shared the good news with me, brought our family out to church as early
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   as I can remember, and ultimately made Christ more real to me.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.800]   While it was a blessing to be born and raised in a Christian home, it indirectly caused
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.120]   me to have an incorrect view of God.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.280]   For me, I didn't see God as holy instead of part, and along with that, I didn't have a
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.920]   proper view of my sin or think that my sins were as bad as they were.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.880]   Throughout my adolescent years, it was apparent that I feared man more than God.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.120]   I was driven by my fear to please people rather than pleasing God himself.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.960]   As a result, anxiety was the driving force in my decision making, and it not only affected
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160]   me but the relationships with others around me.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   It was a life of outwardly declaring that I've accepted Jesus Christ, but not feeling
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.840]   ready to surrender completely on the inside.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.920]   Looking back, I can say that during this confusing time of professing to be a believer, my life
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.120]   was not marked by genuine faith.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.000]   To my friends and family, as long as I seemed to be walking in faith, that's all that mattered.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   But my heart posture showed that I didn't have a deep need for God in my life because
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.160]   I wasn't ready to give up everything just yet.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.200]   I had many idols in my life that I was chasing after.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240]   After I graduated from Biola, I was in a transition period of obtaining my teaching degree and
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.000]   attending a new church.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.880]   This period of uncertainty was a time during which I frequently compared myself to others
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.800]   who seemed to have it all together.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   It made me wonder why my own life wasn't coming together like I had hoped or expected.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   But for the first time, I was having to ask myself, "Who am I trying to glorify and honor?"
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.400]   And I knew it was only God who was convicting me of this truth, that glorifying myself can
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.240]   never bring me the security that can be found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.800]   It was clear to me that through this time of internal struggle, Christ was revealing
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.880]   my idols and my brokenness.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600]   I feared the opinions of others more than God himself.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.800]   Despite this realization of the depth of my depravity, I also saw the depth of his mercy
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.400]   and love for me, that even in my brokenness, I could go to him as I am, and even though
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.320]   I am undeserving, that he would and has already forgiven me of my sins.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.840]   For the first time in a long time, I wanted to look to Christ and have peace, joy, and
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.260]   fulfillment in him, instead of looking to myself and the approval of others.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.400]   I strived to submit to Jesus as Lord and to fully turn away from my old life.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   The past five years of allowing his promises and truth to really reign over my life have
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.800]   been humbling, sanctifying, and awesome in their own way.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.680]   Getting to know my Lord and Savior in this current stage of life has consisted of much
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.200]   reframing of how I used to think.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.280]   I am no longer defined by how others perceive me or seek to win the approval of others.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.560]   Now because I have newness of life and in my mind and heart continue to experience the
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.960]   freedom from sin through God's even grace, I seek to honor and glorify him and him alone.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.640]   This freedom through his grace is reflected in Ephesians 2, 8, which reads, "For by grace
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.920]   you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.800]   Recently I was asked when I was overcome with God's holiness, and I would say right now
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.640]   God is showing me so much of what his holiness means for my life, that there can be no worship
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.800]   and no true obedience without seeking to understand what God's holiness means.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   In this way, I am so thankful that Christ has allowed his holiness to touch my life
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.960]   in his perfect way and timing.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.280]   Like it says in Colossians 3, 3, "My life is now hidden with Christ, and my union with
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.080]   him gives me hope and a full assurance of my eternal life in him."
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   And that's where true joy and freedom is found.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   Thank you.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   [Applause]
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   >> Do you understand what you want me to talk about?
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:25.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   [Applause]
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.840]   (applause)
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080]   (applause)
