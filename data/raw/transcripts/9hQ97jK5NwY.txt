[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Good morning Church family. Happy Lord's Day. We will now begin our service.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   [Music]
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Bless the Lord.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that's within me, praise Him.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all He's done.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He forgives all your iniquities. He heals all your infirmities.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with mercy.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And as far, as far as the east is from the west,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   so great is your steadfast love toward us.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   [Music]
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Bless the Lord.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that's within me, praise Him.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Bless the Lord.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not who He is.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   As a father shows compassion to his beloved children,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   so the Lord shows compassion to us, to those who fear Him.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And as far as the east is from the west,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   so great is your steadfast love.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And as far,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   as far as the east is from the west,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   so great is your steadfast love toward us.

[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   [Music]
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   If you are visiting us for the very first time,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   we want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   When the service is done, out in the parking lot,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   there is the welcome booth.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Please stop by.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We'd love to meet you.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You'll see our welcome team members with the blue lanyards.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And if you have any questions about the church,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   we'd love to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   For this morning, we have just a few announcements to cover.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And the first is that we've been announcing
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   that the All Church Praise and Prayer
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   is going to be happening on Friday, the 25th.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Because our singles ministry is going to be away at a retreat,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I think everyone's going to be able to actually
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   fit in here comfortably and things like that.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So we're going to just have the indoor portion
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   of the seating available on Friday.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So please, again, just mark your calendar.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   There's no Bible study,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   but the praise and prayer this Friday.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Also, on a monthly basis, the outreach team
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   has been planning and coordinating
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   the evangelism outings.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's taking place Saturday, March 5th, from 1 to 2 p.m.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And they're going to several locations
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   like the Buena Park Source or the Irvine Spectrum.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's a great opportunity to exercise that muscle of evangelism
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   and go out together with fellow brothers and sisters.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Make sure you go on the app and sign up for that
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   or on the Facebook as well.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And then finally, for the seasoned fellowship lunch,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   it's going to be taking place Saturday--
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   actually, that probably is Sunday--3, 6 at 1 p.m.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Sunday, 3, 6 at 1 p.m.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And it's for both members or non-members.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   If you're over the age of 50,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   you're invited for a time to come together
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   in fellowship and an opportunity to get to know one another.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So for that as well, in order to prepare,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   please make sure you go on the app or the Facebook
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   to sign up on the link provided.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Today, after we have our time of praise and worship,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   our brother Daniel O is going to come up,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   give his testimony, and be baptized.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So we look forward to that.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   At this time, let's take a moment to pray
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   for both the service and the offering.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You can do the offering online or, again,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   underneath the large clock, there is a box in the back.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Our God, we truly do thank you so much
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   as we just took a moment to sing about how wonderful you are,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that you would remove our sins from us
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   from the east to the west.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We recognize, God, that your work that's done for us, Lord,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   to cleanse us of our unrighteousness,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   truly how amazing it is.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So this morning we gather,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   meditating on your great work, on you,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   giving thanks to you.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And so we pray that even in our offering,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   this would be an expression and reflection of that heart.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   We do pray for the service, God,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   that in our prayer, hearing the message,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   that all this would be to our edification,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   our growth in faith, to understand you more.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And also I pray that as we do this
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and render to you our hearts, God,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   that you would always be honored.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Amen.

[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:09.000]   - Hi, my name is Daniel.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I'm a second year college student,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and today I'll be sharing my testimony.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I was born and raised in a Christian household.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Growing up, I participated in various youth group activities
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   such as DVS and AWANA, and heard the word
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   both at church and at a Christian preschool.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Being exposed to God's word and memorizing scripture
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   early on made me believe in His existence.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   However, I did not fully comprehend the concept of sin
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   or how I stand before Him during this time.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   In high school, I chased after the approval of others.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I was bullied by members of my drumline program,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and it incited a desire to please them at all costs.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Whether it was succumbing to their treatment
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   or conforming to how they wanted me to act,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I would do anything to fit in
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   if it meant being a part of a friend group.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I often felt anxious and sad when my efforts
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   failed to change how I appeared to others.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   One summer, I was challenged about the sin
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   by my small group leader at the time.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Even during the time I sought after others' validation,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I understood it was wrong, but this was the first time
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I saw that idolizing it was a sin and dishonoring God.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   While not immediate, God used that summer
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   to slowly soften my heart.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I felt ashamed of my sin of placing people
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   to a higher importance and being oblivious
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   to the glow of God has shown me.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   While I could confidently say that the gospel
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   was something I truly believed in
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   rather than just had knowledge,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   it was clear that I didn't fully surrender my life to Him.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I thought having faith and believing was enough
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   to be considered a believer,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and it made me take grace for granted.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Even after quitting drumline and finding
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   a more stable community, I continued to live for myself
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and not seek a personal relationship with Him.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I proclaimed that I was a believer
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   but did not reflect it through my actions.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I continued to prioritize fitting in
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and pleasing the crowd over pleasing God.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I often justified this as well as my negligence
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   for the Lord by thinking that He will always
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   be gracious and loving.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   While I felt bad at times about the way I lived,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I ultimately felt guilty at how it appeared
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   to be contradicting the life of a Christian
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   rather than feeling guilty as to how it was dishonoring God.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   When I came to Berean last year,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I was taken aback by how grounded
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   the sermons were in the Word.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I was deeply encouraged being surrounded
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   by believers who took their faith seriously,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and it made me feel challenged in ways
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I haven't felt in a long time.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I slowly realized that being a Christian
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   doesn't just revolve around having faith
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   but also glorifying God by living a life
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   that is worthy of Him.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   1 Peter 2.24 says, "And He Himself
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   bore our sins in His body on the cross
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   for by His wounds you were healed."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I'm truly grateful for how faithful God has been
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   where even during my negligence for Him,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   He revealed Himself to me through the brothers
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   and sisters He has placed in my life.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   While I'm not perfect, I desire to honor Him
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   in everything I do, knowing that my life
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   is not my own but one that He has graciously given me.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   [applause]
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   [silence]
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   [inaudible]
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   [applause]
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   [silence]
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Thank you for that testimony, Daniel.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   We know that we have a lot of brothers and sisters
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   who it's a blessing to grow up in the Christian home
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   but to recognize what is the difference
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   between intellectual knowledge of facts
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   versus having conviction and a personal relationship,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   what a sweet thing to hear.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   At this time, would you take your Bibles please
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to the Gospel of Mark, Chapter 2, Verses 1 through 12.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   We're going to be reading a familiar story
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   within the Gospel narrative about the healing
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   of the paralytic who was carried on a mat
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   by his friends and lowered before Christ.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I'm personally going through the Gospel of Mark
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   for my devotions and I felt that I had certain things
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I had maybe recognized and yet missed
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   and so I wanted to share those convictions with you.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Let's take a look here, starting from Verse 1 and it says,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "When he had come back to Capernaum several days afterward,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   it was heard that he was at home,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   that many were gathered together so that there was no longer room,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   not even near the door, and he was speaking the word to them.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And they came, bringing to him a paralytic,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   carried by four men.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Being unable to get to him because of the crowd,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   they removed the roof above him.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And when they had dug an opening, they let down the pallet
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   on which the paralytic was lying.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   'Son, your sins are forgiven.'
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   But some of the scribes were sitting there
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   and reasoning in their hearts,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   'Why does this man speak that way?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   He is blaspheming.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Who can forgive sins but God alone?'
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Immediately Jesus, aware in his spirit
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   that they were reasoning that way within themselves,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   said to them, 'Why are you reasoning about these things
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   in your hearts?'
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Which is easier to say to the paralytic,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   'Get up and pick up your pallet and walk.'
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   But so that you may know that the Son of Man
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   has authority on earth to forgive sins,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   he said to the paralytic, 'I say to you,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   get up, pick up your pallet, and go home.'
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And he got up immediately, picked up the pallet,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and went out in the sight of everyone,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   saying, 'We have never seen anything like this.'"
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Lord, I pray, Father God, that each Sunday we come in
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   to hear your Word, and we know this is a huge privilege
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   because you are growing our faith
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   by way of both reminder,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   but also granting to us conviction.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And today, as we think about your authority to forgive,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   God, as we think about your work to heal,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   help us, Lord, to see more and more of your glory in that way.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   We thank you, Lord, in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   This morning I think about kind of a cliché term
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that I heard recently and then just kind of thought through it
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   and overthought it and then just kind of came back to,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and that cliché term is,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   you know, in life, God gives you what you need,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   not really what you ask for, right?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   God gives you what you need,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   not necessarily what you want and ask for.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And that's sometimes a pithy statement
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   that doesn't apply in every single scenario,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   but it applies when you're just kind of dealing with life
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and how it comes at you, right?
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That's normally the way it's used.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And then you come across a story like this,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   where actually one of the focal point is God giving
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   precisely what is most needed,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   but not necessarily what was asked.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And then the story builds to God also gives what was asked,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   showing a greater sense of this is the God we have.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   This is the Savior Jesus Christ,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   who is giving both primarily forgiveness,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   but also physical healing.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And as we look at that, then,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I want to both remind you of this famous story,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   but also to stop and ask,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   is there anything that we missed
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   or in greater fashion can appreciate about that,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   about Christ addressing the greatest needs that we have,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   addressing immediate needs,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   but also showing forth the kind of Savior He really is to us.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And so let's begin in the story,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   working first from the setting,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   that Jesus already by this time was famous,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   celebrity status, can't go anywhere, kind of famous,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and there was a crowd around Him.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Let's take a look and it says in the text,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   "When He had come back to Capernaum,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So it seems like He made a home base
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   at perhaps Peter's house in Capernaum.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   "And they were gathered together
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   "so that there was no longer room, not even near the door,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "and He was speaking the word to them."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   We kind of have to think about this idea.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   If you're thinking your house with a bunch of people,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   let's say at a birthday party,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   or maybe some of you guys who participate in our home groups,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   it's all packed in there,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   this is something far beyond that, right?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Because what the Scripture tells us
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   just in the very beginning portion of the Gospel of Mark
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   is that there was so much commotion and so much stir,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   there literally was no walking space.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Why do I say this?
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Because the spectacular works that Jesus was doing
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   was already heard throughout the land, so to speak.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   If you scroll your eyes just a chapter before in Mark 1,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   starting from verse 29, it talks about this.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Mark 1, verse 29 says,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "Immediately after they came out of the synagogue,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   "Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "and immediately they spoke to Jesus about her.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "And He came to her, raised her up,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   "taking her by the hand, and the fever left her,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   "and she waited on them.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   "When evening came after the sun had set,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "they began bringing to Him all who were ill
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   "and those who were demon-possessed,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   "and the whole city had gathered at the door.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   "And He healed many who were ill with various diseases
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   "and cast out many demons.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   "He was not permitting the demons to speak
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "because they knew who He was."
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   So if you think about it, in that city of Capernaum,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   which if you look at the historical context,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   it wasn't like a dinky tiny place.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   There were supposedly somewhere around 1,500, 2,000 people
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   within this small arena, okay?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   They were already going to His house.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   They knew where it was, okay?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   But what's more, even--I guess you could say
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   it was noting that even in the evening,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   people were bringing to Him everybody, right?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And so you can imagine.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Now just before our passage in chapter 2,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Jesus performs another incredible miracle
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   because Jesus heals a leper.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And just as a quick reminder, a leper was seen
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   as the outcast of outcasts.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You cannot touch that person
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   because of their infectious disease, right?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And they were so afraid, but also they cast them out
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   as also spiritual degredants and people
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   that needed to be moved away.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And so the leper was the one who went to Jesus and said,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "Lord, if you're willing, you could make me clean."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And Jesus said, "I am willing, be clean."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And his crusty, broken skin was healed.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Now Jesus told that individual,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   "Don't tell anyone."
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   You know what He did?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Well, if you scroll your eyes to verse 45,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   this is what He says.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Chapter 1, verse 45.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   "The leper," or he, "went out and began to proclaim it freely
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and to spread the news around everywhere
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   to such an extent that Jesus could no longer
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   publicly enter the city, but stayed out
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   in an unpopulated area because they were coming to him
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   from everywhere."
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So was it just the city?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   No.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   People were coming from everywhere.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   So I just want you to understand this scene.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   When it says that the paralytic and his friends
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   were trying to get into the house,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   this wasn't like, "Excuse me, I just kind of need
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   to squeeze through."
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It wasn't like you trying to get through the cafe, okay?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It was a much more crowded arena.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   People were already blockading the door,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and I'm sure there were a bunch of people
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   maybe even thinking, "I'm going to camp out here
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and wait for this guy."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Wouldn't you if you had an ailment?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Wouldn't you if you had a crisis?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And you heard that this individual was doing epic things
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   as only seen in the prophecies of Scripture.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And when the Messiah would come, the blind would see,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   the mute would talk, and more, right?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   So what I'm talking about is you have this crowd,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   and initially when I thought, like,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "Man, there was a paralytic.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Why couldn't they just make some room?"
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   You got to figure, like, there was a large amount of people.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   This wasn't going to be just a nice tap on the shoulder.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   So we move forward, and we do see these individuals coming,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and in a state where, bum, bum, bum,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   there's a massive hurdle, what do they do?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Well, they act on faith, and they seek Christ.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Take a look at the passage in verse 3 through 5.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   It says, "And they came, bringing to him
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   this paralytic man, carried by four men,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   being unable to get to him because of the crowd,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   they removed the roof above him,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   and when they had dug an opening,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying."
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Take a moment with me to imagine what is happening here.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I wish--it doesn't actually record the stuff
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   that the guys said to each other,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   but I wish it did because that would be fun, right?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I mean, just deal alone that--whose idea was that?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Like, who was the guy?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Was it the individual who was the paralytic saying,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   "Oh, gosh, I know we're here.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   We came so far. The crowds are here.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Maybe you take me to the roof," right?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Who was the guy who had that idea?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Or maybe there was--I'm guessing in the bunch,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   if you'd imagine any scenario where you were kind of timid,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   like, "There's a big crowd. He's teaching right now.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   He's preaching the Word. What are we going to do?"
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And then probably there's a scaredy cat saying,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   "Oh, no, guys, what can we do?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Maybe we should turn back."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And then the other one's saying, "No, no, no.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   We're going to make sure--we're going to get all diplomatic
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   with these people and offer them something.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Hey, look at this guy. Let us through."
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Perhaps that didn't work. They tried.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And so they say, "Let's take him to the roof."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   What a story that would be to tell later on, right?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But I want you to understand, at that time,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   it was common in the kind of, like, housing that they had
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   that a lot of people would use their roofs like decks.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   So there may have been ladders or stairs.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I'm just trying to help you envision the scene.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   But nevertheless, this is no one-punch job.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   They had to walk up on top,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   which I'm sure then everybody noticed.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   They had to dig through.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   The roof was typically made with thatch,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   which is kind of like heavy straw with mud and layers of it.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   So it literally says they dug through it.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Sometimes people wonder, was there already a big opening?
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Kind of like when you walk into the entrance of a building
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and you see kind of like this nice entryway
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   where there's also a skylight or something.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   No, it says they dug through the thing.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   They unroofed it.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I'm guessing then there was dirt falling.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I'm guessing they had to make a bunch of noise.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   It wasn't a synchronized, "Okay, on three, dig!"
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   It was quite a scene is what I'm saying
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   in the midst of a big crowd.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And so what's the point that I'm trying to make is,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   you know, when I read through this passage,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and a long time ago, I remember listening to sermons
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   about this passage, one of the kind of takeaways is,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   "Look, these guys had determination."
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Point taken.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   What's more, you can imagine these guys understood,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   "Look, they have a desperate need," it was clear,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   "and nevertheless, even if they didn't have pure faith
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   "for things, they recognized that this individual,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   "if we get before him, he can make these happen.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   "He could heal." That's what I'm talking about.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Now, I want to make this point, yet at the same time,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I don't want to make this point. You know why?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   It's not the main point. It's not the biggest drama
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   of the passage.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   I have heard sermons in the past.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I remember a long time ago this amazing evangelism sermon.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   "You and I need to be like these bold, determined,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   "problem-solving individuals when it comes to carrying
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "a fallen individual to the Lord."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Literally, the analogy works.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   In your evangelism, are you willing?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Spurgeon would say, "You got to grab their leg
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   "before they go to hell," right?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Well, here you're going to say, "You're going to carry them
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   "on your backs and carry them to Jesus."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And every time I heard sermons like that, I'd get hype,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and I was like, "That's right!"
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Now, as I was preparing this sermon, I was going to say,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   "Let's raise the roof!
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "Go evangelize!
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   "Be so bold as to carry somebody on a mat."
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And if you hit a wall because people are in line,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   get in front of them, right?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Or something like that.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   But as you know, that may be something we have to think about
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   because, yes, is it true that we kind of live
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   in a very passive generation?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Some of us, if there is a crowd like this,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and you have a burning question, you have a burning need,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   you have some crisis situation in your heart,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   would you be so bold to ask?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Even in some of my classes that I teach with 20 people,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   you can tell, it's like, "Do you have questions?"
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I'll just wait for after the class is done, right?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Like, they're so scared!
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But let me say this.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I don't think Jesus always commends go-getters,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   risk-takers, right?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   The guys who's always talking first.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Because we know that Christ has at some time said
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   to those individuals, "Stop.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   "You need to learn to get behind."
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Right?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   But at the same time, you think about this for a moment,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Christ does not commend passivity.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Christ does not have a great view of the crowds
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   who are onlookers.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Like, what's going on over there?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   There's a big crowd.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Am I missing freebies?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Like, we're here for the samples kind of people.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   God is not impressed by that.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   God is not impressed by crowds of people.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   We know that.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And so I take that as a point of conviction.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   We do kind of live in a very safe environment.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   We live in a generation where we want securities.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   I know I should go see Christ.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   You first.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Right?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Like, let me see how you do once you go place your faith in Christ.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Let me see how you do once you risk it all,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   when you risk your shame, you risk your reputation,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   you risk your wants, you risk your privileges,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   and then I'll go follow you.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   If anybody is in here thinking that, no, no, no.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   That is not the way to play it safe.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Why?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Because Scripture does actually commend a kind of faith.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   When we know that the value is right,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   when we know that there is a treasure in a person,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   that we are to actually be the individuals,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   not because it's my normal way I roll,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   but because I actually see the value in Christ,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   that I would risk everything,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   that I would make sacrifices.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   It was Christ himself who said,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "The kingdom of heaven is like this and like that."
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And one of those examples in the parable was,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who has found an incredible treasure."
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   What does he do?
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Because he knows the value.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He will go sell all of his possessions and buy the land.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Right?
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He's not looking for samples.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   He's not looking for someone else to go first.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   That is something noteworthy,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   because there is a drive amongst the men
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   where they went against all the eyes that would turn to them.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   They went against the first hurdle, second hurdle.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   They went against the thoughts of, "Are we really going to do this?
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   We're going to rip open somebody else's house?"
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Like, "It's not even theirs!" Right?
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   All the hurdles that come to our own rational minds
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   when it comes to pursuing after God,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   they had to overcome to say,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "Lord, we need to get in front of you."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And that's commendable.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   God desires that kind of persevering, problem-solving persistence.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Why? Because the Lord has said,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   "When we seek God, we seek him with all our hearts."
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Another example of this is in Luke 18.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Jesus gives another parable about how we ought to pray.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   And this is where that story goes.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   He says, "Now he was telling them a parable
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   to show that at all times they ought to pray and not lose heart,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   saying, 'In a certain city there was a judge
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   who did not fear God and did not respect man.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   There was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   saying, 'Give me legal protection from my opponent.'
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   For a while he was unwilling, but after he said to himself,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   'Even though I do not fear God nor respect man,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   because this widow bothers me, I will give her the legal protection.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Otherwise, by continually coming, she will wear me out.'
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   The Lord said, 'Hear what the unrighteous judge said.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Now will not God bring about justice for his elect
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   who cry to him day and night, and will he delay long over them?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I tell you that he will bring about justice for them quickly.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?'"
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   That question is quite a convicting one.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   But because you see the value that you have a desperate need for Christ
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and the blessing that he alone can give,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I need to get to him.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And I know I'm going to be bothering him.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I know I'm going to sound like a nag.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   I know I'm just going to be banging on the door.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   But I need his blessing. I need his protection.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   That is commendable.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And in this way, I ask this question again.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   For us, are there anything and patterns in your life
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   where you have this passive approach
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   when it comes to seeking questions about, "How do I grow?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   How do I overcome sin?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   How do I have that deeper, more intimate relationship with Christ?"
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   You're just afraid to ask.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   You kind of want somebody else to just tell you,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   almost give it to you.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   We know this is going to be a struggle, a persevering struggle,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   that we are going to see Christ in this fashion.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Now, again, this isn't necessarily the main drama,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   but it sets up everything for what Christ is going to do.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   The story commends the men for having at least some faith.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   It doesn't explicitly or exhaustively describe everything that they saw.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   But it notes their faith, and then look what Christ does.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Jesus sees, and he forgives.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Verse 5, going back to Mark 2, verse 5.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   "Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Boom, right there.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   For me, when I read this, I always thought of this passage as like
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   the Jesus is God passage, which is true, and we're going to get to.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   But I don't think I appreciated how dramatic it is for Jesus,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   who in the eyes of the crowd is still yet a miracle worker
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   to say something like this.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And we kind of have to appreciate the scandal of it,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   the "What did he say?" like that kind of moment.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Why? Because when you think about what Jesus is doing,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Jesus sees these people coming to him asking questions,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   but also asking for healing.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   And rather than giving what they asked for, he says,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   But think about that scene.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Remember that Jesus, in calling the individual son, already is strange.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Now, a lot of people respected him as a rabbi, so maybe.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   But the thing of it is Jesus in this scenario is younger than me.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I'm 39. He's early 30s, right?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I meet a lot of people at church, but not a single person have I ever said,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   "My son, thanks for coming and talking to your pastor.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And also, I know you've confessed your struggles, so I forgive you."
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Can you just imagine how strange and how weird that scene would be?
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   You'd be like, "When did you turn Catholic?"
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Or something like that. "What just happened?"
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   "I confessed to you. Why would you say something like that?"
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And that's exactly the appropriate reaction.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   "Why would you say something like that?"
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And the next question would be, "That sounds really arrogant.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   That you would put yourself so above me to call me son,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   and then that you had some kind of clout to just tell me I'm forgiven.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   I didn't sin against you. That's what I would say."
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   I want you to think about how crazy this would be,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   because even from the perspective of the four friends who brought the man,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I would think like, "Huh? The man is sick."
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Okay, I get it. In their culture at that time, it was very prevalent to say,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   "If you see a man who is paralyzed, who sinned?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Him or his father, right? Him or his parents?"
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And so maybe they're thinking, "I knew it. This guy is a flat-out sinner.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   That's why Jesus is whatever."
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   But they didn't actually come for that, right?
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   It would be strange. You'd almost have this feeling like, "Okay, but look.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Did Jesus miss the point?"
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   But actually what's being recorded here is not so much that sentiment.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   So what I'm saying, it's off, right?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   But the sentiment and the drama and the scandal is pointed out,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   not by the crowd or the friends, but the scribes and the Pharisees,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   the leaders of the day, the masters of the text, the elite of the Jews,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   the ones who are set apart.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   They look at Jesus and say, "What in the world did you just say?" Right?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   So take a look. Verse 6.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   They can't believe it. They can't believe what they just heard.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Verse 6, it says, "But some of the scribes are sitting there and reasoning in their heart,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   'Why does this man speak that way? How dare he?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God alone?'"
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And the crazy thing about this is they're like, "What?"
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Like something just happened.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   And the crazy thing of it is they're right.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   They're 100% right.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   They ask a legitimate question.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   How in the world can any human being, any individual,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   put themselves so high as to think that they have the audacity
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   to forgive another man's sin?
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And the thing about it is every good Jew knew
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   that the authority to judge is God's.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Every good Jew rehearsed many, many verses.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   And one of those verses that they rehearsed was the Great Shema.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is one."
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   There's one God, and then the subsequent things about that is
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He is the one who's able to judge.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Other passages I want to show you is like Isaiah 43.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Okay? Isaiah 43, verse 25 says,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   "I am the one who blots out your transgression for my own sake,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   and I will remember your sins no more."
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   If you look at various passages, that right, right,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   the prerogative to forgive sins belongs to God.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   But we need to appreciate that a little bit more
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   by thinking about how crazy and strange it would be
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   to do the otherwise.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   What do I mean?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   I just want you to have the same kind of like, "What?" experience
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   as the people who were listening at the time.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Can you imagine if you were sitting here on a Sunday
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   and you were hearing a sermon, let's say, from Pastor Peter Chung
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   recently about 1 Peter, how we need to be holy,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and in your conduct, right, you need to be holy,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   conducting yourselves in this way.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And so there's this question like, "What sins do you have to work on?
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   What areas of unholiness do you have?"
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   And you feel all convicted.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   You're like, "Oh, that hurt good."
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   And then so you go home, and the first thing your husband says to you is,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   "There's a lot of sin there, huh? I forgive you."
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   You know that conversation?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   How you feel after that?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Or even just your roommate.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   After a convicting sermon about your sin, rather than saying,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   "Oh, yeah, I was convicted. Me too."
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   They look at you and say, "Yeah, I forgive you."
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Your immediate response would be like, "Bitter, are we?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Are you mad about something?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   You have some kind of vendetta against me?
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Like, why would you say that, like that you forgive me?"
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   It naturally assumes that I have now offended you.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Yes?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   The party that needs to forgive is the individual and the party that was offended,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   but then to raise your clout,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   like the sins you commit now offends my laws, my identity,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   who I am, my position, my relationship with you.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   If you aren't that high, that would be such an arrogant thing.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Another just scenario that you have to think about is,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   if Jesus isn't who we know him to be,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   that would be him just like sticking and injecting himself, meddling into a scenario.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   If you have an individual here next to me, and let's say his name is Bob,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and Bob is the sinner going around stealing all your stuff when you're not looking,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   but what's more, when you confront him, he gets all defensive,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   and now he starts throwing curses at you,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   and even disrespecting your mom or something.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   So now you're just upset as can be, and you're about to let him have it.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   How dare you!
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   You disrespect me, disrespect my family, right?
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   I'm going to kill you.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And then I jump in there, and I say, "Whoa, sons, you calm down.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Bob, I forgive you, though."
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   It's like a weird scenario that doesn't even make sense.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Why would I say that?
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   How can I inject myself that way?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   As awkward and strange as that analogy or that simple hypothetical scenario is,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   if Jesus is not who he is, that's exactly what would be true.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   A blaspheming, worse, completely fake, bombastic, arrogant man
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   who is claiming and doing things he should never, ever do because he has no right.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   But that's the point, right?
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   We know that the question that the Pharisees ask comes from a wrong heart,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   but the standard and the question principle there is actually true,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and so we know what Christ is doing is actually so grand
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   because what he is doing is that which belongs to God.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   And as you know, by the definition of sin, looking at a famous psalm that you guys know well, Psalm 51,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   we know that by definition sin is an offense to God Almighty.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Take a look at this passage.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   It says, "Be gracious to me, O God, according to your loving kindness,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   according to the greatness of your compassion.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   For I know my transgressions and my sins as ever before me against you.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   You only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   so that you are justified when you speak, and what blameless when you judge."
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   King David has done horrendous crimes, right?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   If you think about what he did to Bathsheba,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   he abused his power to take a woman that is not his.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   What he did to Uriah, he killed the man, scheming, deceiving.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   I mean, malicious intent?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   The breaking of God's command is there.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   How can he say that his sins is only against God?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   But what we're talking about is by the pure definition of sin,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   sin is a transgression of God's will, right?
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Sin is an affront to God's character.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   It has its dealing and direction against God.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   And therefore, the only person who actually has a right to forgive that sin is God.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And so this passage 100% affirms that Christ,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   in just the act of forgiving, is fully, fully divine.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   In order to do what is only God's prerogative,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   he must have God's power, his authority, his position,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   and that all is true.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   So the reason why I'm thinking about this is because I wanted to appreciate
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   what is happening when Christ forgives
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   and the people around him are looking at him like, "What are you doing?"
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   From Jesus' perspective, being divine, doing his work,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   the only that he can do, and the people questioning, "What is he doing?"
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   We, for one, believe that truly Christ is the one who can forgive and set us free.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   We read in John 8 that Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   The slave does not remain in the house forever, but the son does remain forever.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   So if the son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   You will be free indeed.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Now, we want to see the way that Jesus then responds.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   The thing about it is these questions that the Pharisees and the scribes have,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   it's actually only in their heart.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   They didn't verbalize it out loud.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   But Jesus responds.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   So now turn back over to Mark 2, verse 8, and let's continue on with the story.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   It says, "Immediately Jesus, aware in his spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   said to them, 'Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   Which is easier to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,'
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   or to say, 'Get up and pick up your pallet and walk?'"
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Okay?
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   So earlier I began this sermon saying, you know, there are things that are so clear and emphatic in this passage,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   which is Jesus can forgive sins, and he has the authority to do it.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   But I think some of the things I missed is Jesus' perspective on his rationale of how he's going to prove it.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   This is one grand moment.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   If there was an epic moment, those moments in the Scriptures where it's just like,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   "You don't believe? Let me show you," right?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   And I know Jesus doesn't necessarily talk like that, but if there was any moment where it's like,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   "You doubt me? Well, bam, let me show you," this is one of those moments, right?
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   But look what Jesus says.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Jesus asked this question, "Which is easier do you think to say?"
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And I think I wanted to take time to meditate on that because the answer to that is actually kind of simple.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Because I have a mouth and I could speak, it's very easy to say, "I forgive you," right?
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   But the element that is behind that or what's the thought is, you can't verify that.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   If I say, "I forgive you," there is no empirical evidence that's like, "That's not true.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   He's not forgiven," right?
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   How are you going to prove that?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   But if I say, "Walk," immediately we're going to say, "Was his words consequential?
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Did it have any effect in power?"
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   And the answer is going to be, "He better get up and walk," right?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   And so that's the question.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   But the other question actually you ask is, "But what's actually easier to do?"
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Because the scenario isn't just talk of this and talk of that.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   The scenario is, "Jesus just said, 'I forgive you.'"
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Yes?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   And here's the problem I have with that is there is an argument typically from greater to lesser.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And this is what I mean.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   If we're following the logic, right, we're talking about two things and Jesus is making this comparison,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   the logic goes, "If he is able to make this person be healed and walk, then of course he can forgive sin.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   He's using this as a verification of this," right?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   But sometimes the logic then is, "Man, if he can do this, heal, then of course he can forgive."
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   There is this question of what is more difficult, more profound, more valuable in the work of Christ?
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   And of course, for us we know that the forgiving of sin is not to be seen as he just gave a pass.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Because we could put it in other terms and we know the comparison doesn't even work.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Because what we're asking and put into other terms is, "What's easier to do?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   To appease the wrath of God or make one man stand?"
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   For Jesus, one who is eternal, for Jesus, one whom we know through Colossians, that he created all things through him.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   All things came into being and everything was made by him and for him.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   What's easier?
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   What's the more involved work?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   What's more difficult?
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   And once I saw that, it kind of started to click, like, "Gosh, this is why he's able to say to a leper,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   'I know that you were just cleansed and your skin now is clean and all the shame that came with it is you're released.'"
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Now, granted, maybe it wasn't time for Jesus to be revealed.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Maybe it wasn't time for his suffering, all that kind of stuff.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   But the point is clear.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Jesus expected a man who was healed to stay quiet.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Shhh.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   How could he say that?
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Because by comparison, what is the greater work?
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   To say you're forgiven or to say get up and walk?
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Today, I want to appreciate the kind of work that Christ is doing just in giving the forgiveness.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   If in our minds, for some odd reason, the impossible is the walking and yet the granted is the forgiving, then we have it backwards.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   And my challenging question to you now is as you observe the agenda of the world, the things that make you happy,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   the things that are our actual legitimate goals and pursuits, are the things that are more impossible, the more difficult, the more valuable,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   the more that it will make me happy when I see it come to fruition?
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Is it in the bucket of, "But God, I've been asking to make me walk," or is it in the bucket of, "God, I was looking for forgiveness"?
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   We're talking about what is in this story, what is the ultimate need?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   What is the more profound need of mankind?
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   It is not physical. It is not what we've asked for.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   And Christ knows that what we need is to have our sins dealt with because the greater problem we have on earth is not nations.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Right now, there's all talk of Russia, all talk of China and different powerful forces.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   True, powerful forces. True, on earth, devastating things that could happen.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   But what could be of greater threat to me is my undelt sin.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Why? Because my pride is the riskiest thing if the Scripture says God opposes the proud.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Right? My lust is the greatest threat when God says all of these perversions,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   fornification, adultery, and lust is going to be judged to the T.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   What is a greater threat to me?
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   What would be the more devastating thing?
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   And so I want to ask this challenging thing right now.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   I do believe we are inundated with purposes.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   And I'm going to be honest, I do now get very annoyed when Christians, when they talk of like,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   "Oh, this is so beautiful. This is amazing. This is like the greatest thing we could do."
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   And you know what part of the mission of the church is too?
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   And then they end that sentence with something that, with a lot of hard work and just team play,
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   we could actually make it happen ourselves. Right?
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   I know right now there's a lot of controversy over things like fairness and equity,
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   but within that, we Christians have to dissect very carefully.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   Justice, fairness, and righteousness is all in the will of God.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   But if there's any agenda, pursuit, or end goal that is seen as so beautiful that I'm excited about,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   but the forgiveness and salvation of the lost seems like a granted thing,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   seems quite easy for Jesus to do, then yes, our perspective needs to change.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And we need to be asked again, "What is the easier thing?" Right?
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   What is the easier thing?
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   And what's more, we think about Christ knowing the work that He's going to do,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   saying what He's saying, and it continues to deepen our appreciation for Christ's humility and patience,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   trying to show the people and reason with them.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   I want you to know this. And it goes on to say that.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   Take a look as we conclude the storyline over in verse 10, Mark chapter 2, verse 10.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   "But so that you will know," pause there for a moment.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Jesus didn't have to give a case example. Jesus didn't have to give proof.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   He could have said, "This is what I came to do. I've committed to preaching,"
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   because through the preaching of the Word, you're going to have faith,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   and through faith, you're going to request forgiveness and be saved.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   "But so that you will know that the Son of Man," again, a messianic title.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   "Son of Man" could just sometimes mean human being. You're the child of a man.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   But when He says, "The Son of Man has authority," He's talking about Himself as a person.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   He has authority on earth to forgive sins.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   "And He said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet, and go home.'
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   And so immediately upon the words of Jesus," verse 12, "He got up, He immediately picked up the pallet,
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   and walked out in the sight of everyone." And I can only imagine. I wish we had the videotape.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   The crowd, the masses that I said were so big, bounding up the door entrance,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   probably looking through every window, "What did He say?" kind of stuff, right?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   When this man gets up, everyone just, "Duh." And as he's walking out, just opens up like this.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   That's one powerful scene. And so everybody were amazed. They were glorifying God,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   and they were saying, "We've never seen anything like this."
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   The point here is refreshing our convictions.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   I know you and I believe that Jesus has authority to forgive sin.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   But let's take a moment to think about that authority.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   What does that mean for Jesus to have authority, and how can we appreciate that?
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Well, the fact of the matter is, we recognize that Jesus' authority is high on every scale and every category.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   We know that Jesus has authority over creation, such that when He speaks, He speaks it into being.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Now, when I say that, again, what is true of God was attributed to Christ in so many parts of Scripture,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   that everything came. There is nothing that exists apart from Christ, right?
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   But by the authority of God, of Jesus Christ, by His Word, we know that the winds and the waves obey.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   By the authority of His Word, we know that demons beg for mercy and ask, "Please don't destroy us. Please don't destroy us."
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   By the authority of His Word, nations will crumble.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   To that kind of extent of power, Jesus has authority over sin and death.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Now, for me, this reminded me of my salvation because I am so thankful that when I got saved,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   there was a clarity that was preached to me.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   I was in San Diego as a young high school student, and thankfully this pastor, his name is Pastor Ken,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   he took an interest in me and asked me this question, "Mark, do you have any regrets?"
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   And I almost chuckled. "Any?" More like "many," right?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   There's so many. I have so many regrets. So many guilty feelings.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   So many guilty feelings about the sense of messing up my life.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   So many guilty feelings about breaking my parents' trust. So many guilty feelings.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   And he specifically asked me, "What do you do with the guilt?"
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   And I told him, "You put your head down and you just keep going. You just live with it."
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I'm so thankful he told me, "No, you need someone powerful."
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   In hindsight, I realized what he was saying. You don't need me.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   Like, you don't need a pastor to tell you, "It's going to be alright, son. It's going to be okay."
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Right? Like, that's not what I need.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I need someone with authority and power and the right to tell me, "I forgive you."
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   That's what I need.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   And that pastor told me, "Do you understand the power of Jesus when He forgives?"
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   You see, power and authority are quite overlapping.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   When you think about authority, you're talking about somebody with the right, the legal obligation.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   You're talking about somebody with the prerogative, but you're also talking about somebody with power.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   Somebody who can enforce it.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Right? Because you can talk all you want. You can scream like I'm yelling right now.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   But if I have no ability to enforce something, I actually don't have authority with you.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   What authority do I have?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   Nothing.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   There is power, there is capacity, and more.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   And what that pastor told me, he said, "Mark, you see, when we forgive, we kind of forgive."
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   We say, "I forgive you, but I'm watching you."
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   We say, "I forgive you, but I still have this feeling of like, 'Eh, look at you and your selfishness, and I'm still judging.'"
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   What he told me was, "Jesus, when He forgives, is so thorough. You're clean.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   You're white as snow, and there's no speck.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   There is no, 'I kind of, sort of forgive you until the next time.'"
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   There is a thoroughness that the sin that He forgives you is done.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   When the scripture says, and we sing that it moves from as far as the east and to the west, it's done.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   And he also told me, "When Jesus forgives, it is so powerful."
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   Are we talking about one sin? Two sins? Three sins? Four?
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   We're talking about every single sin you have ever committed.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   We're talking about all the stuff in the past that you even forgot about.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   All the stuff in the past that you're so ashamed, you're so caring.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   All the sins that you commit now, Christ has authority to forgive every single sin.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   You know, right when I finished college, there was this kind of moment of crisis for me.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   Do I go into seminary? Do I not? I needed time to think.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   And during that time, I did silly things.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   And one of those silly things is, as a young man, I wrestled with lust.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I got out a piece of paper that I started writing each time I lusted and sinned.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Started in, okay, senior year in college, I started working my way back.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   Junior year in college, I don't recommend you do that, okay?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   I started writing like sophomore year in college, freshman year in college, senior year in high school, and I started writing it down.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   And I remember just crying over my paper.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Because the end conclusion is, "Mark, you're filthy.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   You're out of control. You have no restraint.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   What's wrong with you?"
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   That's how I felt.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   To that kind of sentiment, we have to know the authority of Christ is there.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   And now I think from Jesus' perspective, he has come committed and devoted to give you a kind of forgiveness that's perfect.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   That forgiveness comes with authority.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   It comes with perfect thoroughness.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   It comes with vast ability and capacity.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   And it can be given to you in such a way it's so secure.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   It's solid.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   And when he gives us forgiveness, the first response and the thoughts of the people are, "What are you doing?
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   What did you say?"
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   And in this way, their thoughts are wicked.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   For us, if there are those of you who are wrestling with this strange passivity,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   I don't know, you know, that you think it's more noble for you to sit in the back, wait, bite your tongue, and not say anything,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   because Jesus entered this world and appeared to give us this forgiveness,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   no, you come asking.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   For those of us who are a bit too hard and resisting,
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   "Oh, but maybe I can do some things on my own.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Maybe I can put patches.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Maybe I can learn to better because, honestly speaking, I feel guilty.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   But, man, I know I can do better than this."
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   No.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Jesus has authority to give you his perfect forgiveness.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   Amen?
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   And we're being challenged.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   Come and seek that forgiveness from Christ.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   That is the more impossible, weighty matter.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   It is the greatest need of our lives, more than anything we can imagine or ask for.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   And we know that because he has the authority, not only does he have the right,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   but by his character, he has a heart and intent to give that to us.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   Amen?
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And so I conclude, for any of you feeling a sense of guilt,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   and the guilt is when we are made aware that we have transgressed God's law,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   we will feel that guilt.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   And then when we're made aware that that guilt is actually visible, we're going to feel shame.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   It's visible to Christ and it's visible to the brothers and sisters around us.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   If we allow our passivity, our scaredness, our weird sense of uncertainty
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   to let that reside in your soul, you and I know that will decay us to the bones.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   King David said it.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   Like being underneath scorching sun, his bones are going to go dry.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   And so, knowing this power of Christ, we must come.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   I leave you with this amazing passage in Nehemiah 9, verse 17.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   It was referenced because the people, after seeing and hearing all this,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   they were like, "Wow! We've never seen this stuff!"
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   But actually, I mean, there are people who are supposed to rehearse God's wondrous miracles
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   and saving grace over and over again every year, at bare minimum at the Passover,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   remembering the miracles that God performed on their escape from Egypt.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   But look at what this passage says as it reveals what Christ's character is
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   through how God's character is.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   "They refused to listen and did not remember your wondrous deeds which you had performed among them.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   So they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   and you did not forsake them."
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   He did not forsake them.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   We think about the story, there are swaths of people disappointing.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   I'm pretty sure Jesus, like, there was a temptation to be skeptical and sarcastic.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   "Y'all come for the food, I get it!" And there's hordes of them.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   And plenty of times he turned people away.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   But here, the paralytic and his humble friends feel this desperate need,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   "We need to get in front of you, Lord."
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   They dig the hole, they come down, and rather than scolding them and pushing them away,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Jesus says, "Son, I forgive you."
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   That's to us the gospel. And I pray you'll be encouraged. Let's pray.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Lord God, we are designed to grow in faith.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   And God, we remember the simple truth that God, while we live on this earth,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   it is not time to build for ourselves our fortresses.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   It is not time to build for ourselves our great ambitions,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   but rather, you gave us time to repent and reconcile with you.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   I pray, Father God, that we would see by faith what is more important,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   what is greater, what is the weightier, more valuable thing that we receive from you.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   So that God, our pure joy and excitement would be reserved for the things that you do in our hearts,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   when you wash us, when you sanctify us, and you lead us in your righteousness.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   I pray, Father God, that every single one of us would grow in such appreciation,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   that God, you were so patient with the people from long ago,
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   and Christ, when he appeared, he was so patient,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   that God, even in the midst of giving grace, he was being questioned,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   he was being ridiculed.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   And Lord, in his desire to show, in his desire to convince and to reason,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   he also gave us the manifestation of his power.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   And so for all of that, Lord, we can do none other than to thank you.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   And so we pray to you this morning, it's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   [Music]
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   You came to us.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   You came to us, O man, your very nature God.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   You pierced through our iniquities as you hung upon the cross.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   But God exalted you to the highest place.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   He gave to you the right to bear the name above all names.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   And at the name of Jesus we should bow.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   And every tongue confess that you are Lord.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   And when you come in glory for the world to see,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   we will sing hail to the King.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   With all his splendor and majesty,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   hail to the King of Kings, Lord Jesus our God.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   [Music]
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   We eagerly await.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   We eagerly await the coming of the day.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   The glory of the risen King will shine upon the earth.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   The rival thrones will fall before the Lord of all.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   And hail supreme authority and the true and living God.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   At the name of Jesus we should bow.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   And every tongue confess that you are Lord.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   And when you come in glory for the world to see,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   we will sing hail to the King.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   With all his splendor and majesty,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   hail to the King of Kings, Lord Jesus our God.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   Hail to the King.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   Hail to the King.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   With all his splendor and majesty,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   hail to the King of Kings, Lord Jesus our God.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   [Music]
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   Let's pray together.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Our God, we do continue just to pray that our strength would be in the faith.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   Lord God, just being able to see with the lens that the things that are truly important are not the things that we see with our eyes.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   That God, the weightier things are the things that you tell us according to your word.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   And what's more, today we're reminded that the forgiveness of sinners, this is the greatest thing to us, our greatest treasure, and the greatest thing we can share.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   And with that kind of simple thought and faith, I pray, it would really move us in the week.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   I also pray, God, anybody here who wrestles with guilt, wrestles with fear, and a shyness of coming to you because they're ashamed,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   I ask, Father God, that you would open our eyes to realize, God, it has been your intention to give us this forgiveness.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   And it has been your intention for us to respond to you with absolute glee and thanksgiving.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   And so, Lord, I pray that even just during the week when we fail, Lord God, when we sin,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   that our hearts would long for you to receive your grace.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   And what's more, God, to return all things to you in praise and thanksgiving.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Now to him who was able to keep you from stumbling and to make you stand in the presence of his glory, blameless with great joy,
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever. Amen.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   God sent his Son.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   He came to them.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   He lived and died.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   To buy my pardon.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Amen.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   True is life, the Lord our God.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Strong to save, faithful in love.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   My debt is paid and the victory won.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   The Lord is my salvation.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   Glory be to God the Father.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   Glory be to God the Son.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   Glory be to God the Spirit.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   The Lord is our salvation.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   Glory be to God the Father.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Glory be to God the Son.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   Glory be to God the Spirit.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   The Lord is our salvation.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   The Lord is our salvation.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   The Lord is our salvation.
