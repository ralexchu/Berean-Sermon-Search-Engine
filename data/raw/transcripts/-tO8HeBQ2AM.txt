[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.200]   On the podcast, we've looked at grumbling
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.240]   and we've looked at complaining several times actually.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.000]   But what about venting?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.440]   Or is venting just a nice word for complaining?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.080]   This question has been asked by several listeners recently.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.880]   Here are two examples of those questions.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.540]   One is from Allison, "Pastor Jen, hello.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.020]   "My friend and I have long discussed
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.740]   "if there's a difference between complaining and venting.
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.440]   "Our desire is to be mindful of our hearts reaction
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   "to tough situations.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   "How do we as believers express frustrations
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.720]   "to those closest to us to bear one another's burdens
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.320]   "without falling into misery, loves, company?
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.300]   "Is there a difference between complaining and venting
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600]   "or are we kidding ourselves?"
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160]   Another listener named Sina, S-I-N-A, Sina,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.640]   writes this, "Dear Pastor John, thank you
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700]   "and thank you, Tony, for this podcast.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.600]   "It's an incredible blessing in my life.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360]   "My question is this,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900]   "is venting the same thing as grumbling?
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.460]   "Philippians 2.14 commands us to do all things
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.880]   "without grumbling or disputing.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.340]   "Does this apply to venting as well?
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960]   "I am in a stressful graduate school environment
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.480]   "and complaining is the norm among students.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.020]   "Over the years, I have distinguished
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.920]   "between complaining versus venting.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.800]   "Complaining is sinful, venting is sinless."
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   Here's the distinction that I use
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.120]   using a hypothetical scenario of a teacher
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.780]   who continually assigns overwhelming amounts of schoolwork.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.040]   Complaining says, "I can't believe this teacher
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   "is doing this to us.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.860]   "Doesn't he or she understand
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.080]   "that we have lives outside of school?"
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.480]   Anyone with a brain would know that.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.120]   Venting, however, says, "This class is truly difficult.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.040]   "I knew graduate school would be difficult,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.160]   "but this amount of schoolwork
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.880]   "makes it feel like I'm drowning.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.580]   "I don't know if everyone feels like this
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.360]   "or if it's just me."
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.360]   Can you validate or correct this distinction?
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   I don't wanna encourage venting if it is in fact sinful.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   - A question like this cannot be answered
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.420]   without definitions.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.920]   You can't defend or condemn a word
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.600]   like complaining or venting
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   until you know what the reality is
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.840]   that the word is referring to.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.320]   When that's clear, then you're in a position to say
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.120]   that reality is good or that reality is bad, sinful.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.080]   And usually what happens when you insist on definitions
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.580]   before you jump into a discussion or debate
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.580]   is that the very effort to define the terms
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.680]   turns out to settle the debate
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.260]   because the definitions often contain
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.160]   the unspoken differences
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.680]   that were causing the debate in the first place.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.360]   And when you see the different realities clearly
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.760]   that the words were expressing,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.040]   then you can make judgments
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   about whether those realities are good or bad,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.320]   according to the Bible.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   Now, Sina comes close to giving me a definition
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   of complaining and venting.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.760]   She does it with two illustrations
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.680]   rather than two definitions.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.740]   But if we work backward from her illustrations,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.240]   we can arrive at definitions, at least partial definitions.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.520]   So let's try that.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.260]   What's clear from her illustration of complaining
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.660]   is that it involves a put down of someone else.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.120]   It ends with, anyone with a brain would know that.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.280]   Okay, got that.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.780]   So complaining in her definition
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.120]   involves pointing the finger at a person
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.000]   with intent to blame and probably in a demeaning way.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.960]   Venting, on the other hand,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.040]   she illustrates with a lament
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.220]   about how hard things feel to her,
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.520]   and she's not sure how they may feel to others.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.560]   So there's no finger pointing
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.800]   in her illustration of venting,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.640]   no absolutizing of her feelings
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.320]   as though they were representative of everybody's feelings.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.600]   So venting, it seems, she would say,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.040]   is expressing your frustrations about a situation
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   without necessarily accusing or blaming anybody else.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.540]   Now, she would like me to validate that distinction or not
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.000]   and give my opinion about whether such venting is sinful.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.640]   So my answer is, well, you can define your terms
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.160]   any way you wish, as long as you make clear
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.080]   they are your definitions rather than claiming
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.640]   that they are Bible definitions
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.740]   or anybody else's definitions.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.560]   So given your definitions, Sina,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.860]   yes, there is a real distinction,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.960]   expressing heartfelt dissatisfaction
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.200]   with circumstances with blaming
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.080]   or expressing heartfelt dissatisfaction
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.960]   with circumstances without blaming.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.480]   Now, is one of those sinful?
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   And the answer is, both might be sinful
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.600]   and both might not be sinful.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   That's the answer.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.340]   It is possible for Christians to feel
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.000]   and express great dissatisfaction
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.920]   with harmful circumstances,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.480]   and at the same time, draw attention
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.980]   to the guilty person who's causing them
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.520]   and not be sinning when they do that.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.340]   For example, Paul said to Titus,
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.500]   "There are empty talkers and deceivers.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.460]   "They must be silenced since they are upsetting
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.000]   "whole families by teaching for shameful gain
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.300]   "what they ought not to teach.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.700]   "Rebuke them sharply."
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.500]   So clearly, Paul is not happy.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.520]   He is not happy with these circumstances on Crete.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.100]   He speaks negatively about it,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.120]   call it what you will, expresses his dissatisfaction,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.100]   and he identifies the guilty,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.900]   and he tells Titus what to do about it.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.660]   Silence them, rebuke them.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.420]   Now, Paul was not sinning when he spoke like that.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.300]   He expressed dissatisfaction and he expressed blame,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.580]   and it wasn't sin.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.020]   On the other hand, it is possible to so-called vent
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.140]   and express dissatisfaction with your circumstances
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.820]   without pointing the finger at anybody and yet be sinning,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.560]   because there are more ways to sin
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.540]   than by blaming other people for your problems.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.860]   Paul said, "I have learned in whatever situation I am
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.820]   "to be content.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.600]   "I know how to be brought low
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   "and I know how to abound in any and every circumstance.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.900]   "I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger,
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.300]   "abundance and need.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.460]   Philippians 4, 11 to 13.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.460]   So it may be sin to simmer with frustration
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.500]   over your circumstances without pointing any finger
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.320]   because it's a sign of underlying lack of faith
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   in the goodness and wisdom of God,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.840]   a sign that we have not yet learned
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.940]   the secret of contentment in the strength
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.940]   and fellowship of Christ in spite of difficulty.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.020]   So let me step back and see if I can say something
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.280]   more broadly and biblically that I hope will help us
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100]   sort out how we should respond to hard circumstances,
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.260]   whatever you call it, complaining or venting,
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.260]   how should we respond to hard circumstances?
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.580]   I think the most fundamental thing to say
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.060]   is that God is absolutely sovereign
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.080]   over all our circumstances.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.160]   Ephesians 1, 11, "He works all things
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.360]   "according to the counsel of his will."
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.440]   Therefore, our deepest response to our circumstances
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   should be, "God, my good and loving
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:54.000]   "and wise and strong Father has dealt me this hand,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.040]   "this hard hand."
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.360]   These painful, difficult circumstances
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.860]   are ultimately from my Father's
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   wise, strong, sovereign providence, his hand.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.940]   And he has my best interest at heart.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.280]   I bow my heart before him and say with Mary,
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   "I am your servant, do with me as you think best."
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.080]   And in that posture of faith,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.840]   we should have a deep, settled peace
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.460]   beneath whatever else we may feel.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.880]   Now, with that foundation of unwavering faith
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.840]   in God's sovereign care,
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.600]   so that we enjoy a profound,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   unshakable contentment of soul in God,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.200]   we will be in a position
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   to express a kind of holy dissatisfaction
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   with different kinds of circumstances.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.560]   I know that may sound paradoxical.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.200]   Well, you just said deep, unshakable contentment,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.640]   and now you're saying express dissatisfaction?
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.480]   Yes, I am.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   And I would call it something like dissatisfied contentment.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.600]   I said to Noel last night when I was thinking about this,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.640]   you know, that takes me back to 1977
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.280]   when I was thinking about Christian hedonism
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.800]   at the horizontal level,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.200]   and I wrote an article for his magazine
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   called "Dissatisfied Contentment."
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   Wow, such memories.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.860]   So for example, if we encounter sin,
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.120]   we should feel dissatisfied with it,
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.700]   both in ourselves and in other people.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.200]   And this may involve in others a quiet correction,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.520]   like it says in Galatians 6,1,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.120]   restoring a brother in the spirit of meekness,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.320]   or it may involve a public rebuke,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.960]   as in 1 Timothy 5,20,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   where you to rebuke an elder openly
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.200]   for his continuing in sin.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Or if we encounter grief in ourselves or in others,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.400]   we should feel sympathy
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.280]   and our heart should go out of ourselves
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.520]   and weep with those who weep,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.240]   and weeping is a kind of dissatisfaction, right?
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.360]   Weeping is a kind of dissatisfaction with this pain.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.040]   I defined compassion once as
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   the weeping of joy
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.280]   impeded in the extension of itself to another.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.040]   Compassion is the weeping of joy,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   by that I mean that deep, settled contentment,
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.800]   the weeping of joy
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.160]   impeded in the extension of itself to another.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   I was trying to come to terms with holy contentment
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.440]   in God's sovereignty
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.000]   and holy dissatisfaction
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.880]   with the world the way it is.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.400]   It is not inconsistent
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.200]   to have a deep, settled contentment of soul
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.640]   in the sovereign goodness of God,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.880]   and at the same time, be weeping
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.680]   because of circumstances that are painful.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   One more illustration.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   What if we encounter injustice?
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.800]   We are to feel dissatisfaction with injustice
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.680]   and even indignation, perhaps,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.080]   and we should express our disapproval
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.040]   and our desire to set things right as much as possible.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.920]   Proverbs 31.9 says,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   "Open your mouth, judge righteously, justly,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.960]   defend the rights of the poor and the needy."
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.440]   So the upshot is this, from those illustrations,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   both complaining and venting, as Sina defined them,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:08.080]   may or may not be sinful, both of them.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.880]   The decisive question is this, maybe two questions.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.480]   Is there a deep, settled faith
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.880]   in the all-wise, all-good providence of God
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.280]   that gives you an unshakable contentment in Him
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   beneath all dissatisfactions?
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.680]   And second, are we, in expressing our dissatisfactions,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.320]   are we speaking our dissatisfactions
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.040]   because of a hatred of sin, which is good,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   and a zeal for God's glory, and a love for people?
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.840]   Or are we just wrapped up in ourselves?
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.400]   - Yeah, very good perspective here.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.280]   Dissatisfied contentment.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.440]   And that Proverbs 31.9 point about social justice
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.840]   and venting in public over them,
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.560]   we cover back in APJ 672.

[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.920]   Well, business success, that's the theme next time.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.400]   How do we glorify God when our business is succeeding?
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.520]   It's no small topic.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
