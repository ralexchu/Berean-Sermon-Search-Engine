[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Hebrews chapter five.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.960]   Hebrews chapter five.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.280]   And this will be our kind of platform text and we'll be jumping around to different texts
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280]   today.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.840]   Let's take a, let's see, verse 11 through 14.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.960]   Okay, Hebrews chapter five, verse 11 through 14.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.600]   And the word of God says this, "Concerning him, we have much to say.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.040]   And it is hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.280]   For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.400]   the elementary principles of the oracles of God.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.380]   And you have come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.720]   For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   for he is an infant.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   good and evil."
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.200]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.140]   All right, God, we want to thank you.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.680]   And we pray, Father Lord, at this time that as we know your truth to be powerful, Lord,
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280]   we hope to be enlightened and moved by it.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.840]   Lord, would you continue to work on the soil of our heart that again, as we receive, would
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.680]   we be eager, we would be desiring to apply it into our lives and that ultimately it would
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960]   have its effect.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.840]   God, we also lift up our pastor Peter as he's speaking at a retreat, praying Lord that as
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.160]   the church has gathered their living way, Lord, you would minister to them with your
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   truth through him as well.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   Father, we thank you.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   Amen.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360]   All right.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.560]   Well, I love talking with new parents, you know, parents who just recently had kids and
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.920]   whatnot.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.480]   Whenever there's like a major shift in your life, there's a whole series of questions
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.640]   and interesting things to talk about.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   Namely, they're always wanting to talk about tips and how to's and how do you do this and
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680]   how do you do that?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.600]   And one of the main things that they teach you as soon as you have a kid and everybody's
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.840]   like super in tuned and wanting to learn is how do you get your baby to stop crying?
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   Okay.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.600]   Because when the baby is crying, you know, like through the day and then through the
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.120]   night and it's 2am, 4am and your stress level is like up to here and that means you're not
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.880]   sleeping, you know, and like, please help me.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.400]   And what's really cool is that I don't care, I don't know if you care to know this, but
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.760]   the doctors give you this like, Hey, here are the five S's to pacify your baby when
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.520]   they're going crazy, you know?
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   So here they are, five S's.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   Okay.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   The first I found to be pretty hilarious.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.760]   It's just to shush the baby.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   It's like shush.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   Not like that kind of shush.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.280]   But when I, the first time the doctor showed us how I just like, it's chuckling inside
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.480]   because the doctor just basically took the baby and was like, this is how you do it.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.560]   Like all up into the baby's ear.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.920]   And I was like, Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.600]   But you got to let the baby hear the sound, you know?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.840]   Cause you know, as they're crying and stuff, they're not going to be able to hear you.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.160]   So I remember thinking like, that's hilarious.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   Okay.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.880]   The next one is really funny.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280]   It's called swaddling your baby.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.280]   Okay.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.760]   So for those of you guys who don't know, it's kind of like working at Chipotle.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.240]   You basically stuff as much as you can in the blankie and then you wrap it as tight
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.800]   as you can so the baby can't move, you know?
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.160]   And then the strong ones are like, you know, they get their arm out.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.200]   It's really funny when you watch the guys do it.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   It's even funnier.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.040]   And cause you know, they try multiple times, the baby's getting loose and baby's still
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.240]   crying and their stress level.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.400]   Again, I'm talking about myself.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.280]   My stress level is just going through the roof, right?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   There's other ones.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.400]   There's an S where you have to swing the baby.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Okay.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   The guys are thinking, not shake the baby, but swing the baby, swing the baby.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   You know, the motions of kind of mimicking what the baby experienced through the womb
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.460]   There's another one which I thought was also hilarious was basically turned the baby on
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.260]   its side or stomach.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.660]   So you take the baby, like if this was a baby, you take it by its little chin, you hold it
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.880]   like this and you just hold it like a football, you know?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.400]   But when you flip it over, there's this once in a while, and it doesn't work every time,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   but sometimes the baby just calms down rather than let's say if you're holding it upright
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.600]   or if you're holding it like this, you know?
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.120]   And then the other one is just giving the baby a pacifier to suck on the pacifier, you
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   know?
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   Again, I don't know if you guys care to know all that stuff, but if you're a new parent,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.320]   that stuff is like gold, you know, cause you need it.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.920]   You know, you need it.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.280]   Now the reason why I bring this up is because for me, I learned the five S's.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.200]   I memorized it and I can go through it with you even now, even after it's been like five
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.280]   years since I first used them.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.960]   But the thing about it is in the moment when you're a brand new dad and your baby is crying
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   and he's just saying, "Ahh!" and your stress level is up, you're like, "I just want you
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   to sleep.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   I don't know what's wrong."
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.280]   Your first question is like, "Which one of the five do I do?"
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.480]   Right?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.080]   And so typically you just go with the one that's what you think is going to work, which
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.080]   for me was the "Ahh!"
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.800]   You know, like we were screaming into the baby's ear.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.240]   But there's always a question of what to do when, right?
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.600]   Well today we're going to be talking about a topic that I have been thinking about a
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.120]   lot, discussing with some of the brothers and I've been thinking about, which is wisdom
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.280]   and discretion as a Christian.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.560]   And the thing about it is we will always have questions whenever you face different circumstances
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.360]   in your life, huge transitions in your life, major problems in your life.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.720]   There are going to be these questions.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   Yeah, I know various things that the scripture has taught me.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.840]   You know, I've been going to church for a long time.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.760]   I know the precepts and stuff like that, but what to do when, it's always a difficult thing.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.460]   And this is where we as believers need to grow in wisdom, in skill of knowing when to
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.960]   apply what and when and how.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   And God has called every single one of us to grow in this facet.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.360]   First and foremost, that we should eagerly desire wisdom as a precious jewel, scripture
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.680]   says.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.600]   But I feel the need to go over this because truthfully speaking, again, as I walk my own
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.520]   life I always feel this sense of like, for lack of better words, there's a lot of times
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.760]   I feel dumb.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.680]   I don't know what to do.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   And then when I talk to individuals, they're always at a loss, like what do I do?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.000]   And then sometimes there's so many different contributing factors that make wisdom, making
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   decisions, making judgment calls so tough for us, right?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.360]   And I don't know if you come in this sanctuary this morning already in a situation like that
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.440]   where you're always thinking like, oh, what do I do?
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.000]   Should I do X, Y, Z, combination of Z and Y, what should I do?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.840]   For us, we have to learn and grow in the skill and ask for wisdom so that we might be able
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.000]   to maturely handle all these things we know we're going to encounter in our lives.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.480]   And so to give you a kind of a road map of today, we're talking about namely wisdom and
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   discernment.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.000]   We're going to first talk about what it is.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.720]   What is wisdom and discernment?
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   Why it's so incredibly important that you have it and then how do you get it?
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.560]   So easy three step.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.840]   First, the next couple of points I'm going to run through with you quite quickly, but
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.560]   I'm going to ask you this question about do you understand what discernment is?
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.760]   And the way I'm going to go through this is to give you some key words as you're taking
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   notes.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   Okay, so this is the what is discernment.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.280]   First investigation.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.840]   Uh huh.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:17.360]   A question to you is you can write the keyword investigation, but do you know how to ask
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.480]   and inquire and investigate about situations, but also about truth and what the Lord's standard
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.680]   is?
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.920]   Let me ask that another way.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.360]   Do you have a pattern in your life where you practice this, where you come across a situation
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.520]   and it's just not like, I don't want to deal with this so frustrating.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.600]   So right, we can do lots of different things.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   Okay, we can do lots of different things.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.360]   We can shun decision.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.400]   We can shun stuff that's complicated.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   We can block our heads, not ask because we don't want to care.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.080]   We don't want to be bothered with it.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   Or you overcompensate.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   You're like, well, I'm the man.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   I don't need to hear anything.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.440]   I'm just going to make a decision and go.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.720]   Stuff like that could happen.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.400]   My question was to ask and have a time of inquiry now to evaluate ourselves.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.660]   Inquiry.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.720]   Do you know how to ask, to ask and discover what's going on in your life that needs a
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.480]   decision but also to ask the Lord, what would you have me do here?
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   What would be your standard here?
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.040]   What would be your best suggestion, command, exhortation or correction?
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.760]   Whatever it may be, what does the Lord say?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.160]   That has to be first.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.560]   And then secondly, keyword, analyze.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   Analyze.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   So if you're a good scientist, you can use other terms like first observe so you can
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.960]   get the data and then you've got to interpret it.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.240]   But you've got to analyze what's going on.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.560]   What's the core issues here?
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   What are the main things we have to address?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.320]   What are the main people involved and who do I need to consider?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.000]   The analytical part of our mind, some of us are naturally in tune with.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.760]   It's just like, boom, I see it like this.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   I think it's like that.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.240]   And then you've already been skilled at categorizing, already interpreting.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.560]   This is why it's the problem.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   This is the solution.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.680]   There's an analytical process that goes on.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.880]   Some of us like, what?
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.040]   But nonetheless, no matter where you are, you have to grow in your ability to analyze
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.640]   what's happening.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   But namely, to analyze through the lens of scripture.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.920]   And so let me give you some examples of this stuff.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.400]   I think Jesus is an amazing teacher.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   He is the greatest educator because he educates by truth, by example, and such profound, profound
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   teaching.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.640]   And his methodology is awesome too.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.520]   And if you notice the way he typically teaches, what does he do?
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.660]   He asks questions, right?
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.080]   And so he kind of teaches them on this inquiry and analyzing.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.760]   And he always does this thing.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.280]   Some scheming Pharisee might come along like, "Hey, Jesus."
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   Never mind.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   Sorry, Pharisees don't walk like that.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   Sorry.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.480]   They're scheming, that's sly, and so I kind of walk like that, like a Golem or something.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   But they're probably proper and like, "Hey, Jesus."
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.520]   They were like people of the law.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   "Jesus."
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.480]   And they try to trap him.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.760]   What do we do with taxes?
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   We pay Caesar?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   Do we give this to God?
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   What do you do about marriage?
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.080]   If a husband dies, whose husband is this woman going to be?
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.880]   What do you say about ... So many times for the gospel, they have questions trying to
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.520]   trap him and do all this thing, and you can imagine Jesus going through this process,
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   right?
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520]   The disciples ask him questions.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   "What does this mean?
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   What does that mean?"
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.480]   And Jesus' answer and response to that typically initially is what?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   What is this?
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.840]   Is it Caesar's?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.360]   Whose image is on here?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.520]   He analyzes, asks questions, and then he says, "What does the word say?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   Haven't you heard?
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   Didn't you listen?
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.800]   Didn't you grow up in the synagogue and hear and listen to the word being preached and
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   preached?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.600]   Don't you know the precepts?"
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.200]   And Jesus would point strictly at them and say, "Don't ... Haven't you gone through this
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   process of discernment and wisdom to ask and then to analyze what's supposed to be?"
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.080]   And for us, the reason why I bring this up is because there is a dilemma.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.140]   In the book of Hebrews, chapter 5, the passage that we first read, again, as a platform for
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.760]   this discussion, if you listen to the tone, is it a lot like, "Hey, guys, what's going
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   on?"
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   Is that the tone?
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.080]   No, it's, "Hey, guys, what's going on?"
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   It's a frustration.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.280]   You should be wise.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.960]   You should be at a point where you're articulating the standards of God and the wisdom of God
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.520]   to other people, but right now you need to learn the basics, and mainly because you guys
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.160]   are infantile and you're not able to tell left from right.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.760]   Sorry, that was my right and that was my left, so case in point, right?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.080]   You guys aren't able to discern this side or that side, good or evil, and there's a
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.600]   frustration there.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.360]   Likewise, even in Jesus' time, this issue of wisdom according to the word of God was
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.920]   something that Christ was desiring for his people to grasp.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.600]   But my point in terms of when I come to the topic of discernment, we had two key words
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.280]   so far, investigate, analyze.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   Last is judge.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.320]   Sorry, that's not last, it's the third one.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   Judge, okay?
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   Judge.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.840]   Are you able to make biblical judgment?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.440]   That is at the key, core, critical thing of the whole sermon today.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.560]   Educate yourself about how you go about your life, and whether it be parenting like I gave
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.200]   the example of before, because the Bible doesn't speak about how to shush your baby, but the
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.600]   Bible talks a lot about how to raise godly children.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   How you go about your careers, how you go about your schooling, how you go about church,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   friends.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.880]   Again, in every one of these specific circumstances of your life, how to deal with parents, how
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.080]   to deal with unbelievers in your family, how to deal with difficult people that you run
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   across, how to deal with the church membership, all that kind of stuff has a question of what
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.760]   to do and how to do it.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.640]   Are you able to make biblical judgments?
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:35.120]   See, this generation is so far and so vile, they have completely convoluted the line between
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.640]   what is right and wrong.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   And then they act like it's a humble thing not to know.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.840]   Can I encourage every single one of you?
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   It is not humble to pretend like you don't know.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.360]   Let me explain that a little bit.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.440]   If God gives you truth, it is not humble for you to act like you don't know.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.760]   That's called rebellion.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.240]   If God gives you direction, if God gives you verdict, if God gives you command, if God
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.120]   gives you precept, and you ask like, "Yeah, I heard you, but I don't know."
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.440]   That's not humility.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.480]   But the world wants you to think that because they're always saying like, "Who are you to
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.320]   judge?"
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.000]   But the fact of the matter is, for you as a Christian, you not only have an obligation,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.920]   but you have a calling from God to exercise a capacity that is His.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   Exercise the kind of judgment that God exercises in your life.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.760]   Because God has granted to you both His truth, His Spirit, and His Son so that you might
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.640]   do it.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.160]   And we have to heed that calling.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.720]   Do you have a hard time deciphering what is selfish and what is not?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.040]   And I ask that because, man, I had to wrestle with that a lot just recently.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.720]   Everything from disciplinary actions that happen in the church, everything from what
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.040]   happens in my family, everything from what makes me angry.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.560]   It takes an individual who is trying to practice discretion to evaluate, "Was that thought
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.480]   selfish or was that thought holy?"
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   Are you able to discern, "This is godly, this is worldly, this is righteous, this is
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.400]   evil, this is beneficial, this is detrimental, this will benefit my church, this will hurt
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   my church."
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.120]   Are you able to practice that kind of judgment?
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.880]   And if you're like me, where typically you're afraid of judgment, not the kind of judgment
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.680]   where you're being judged, but you're afraid of making a judgment, you're afraid of being
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.320]   wrong, you're afraid of whatever it may be.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's too much of a burden for you.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.920]   There's many, many reasons.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.400]   Many, many reasons.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.720]   But I go down this line again.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.440]   So far we had investigate, analyze, judge.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.080]   Last is biblical application.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.440]   There are those who make an accurate judgment call.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   And those of you guys who are like, again, God has gifted us very differently, lots of
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   different personalities.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.480]   But there are those people who see something, boom, this is wrong, this is wrong.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   Things pop out to them.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.320]   And they're just like, "That's a problem, that's an issue."
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.200]   And when they see it, they can't ignore it.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:22.880]   For example, when a guy has an apartment, it's filthy, but to him it's like, "What's
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.880]   wrong?"
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.040]   And other people walk in and it's like, "Dudes."
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.120]   Spiritually stuff like that happens.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.240]   Where some people see it, some people don't.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.440]   I love those people who see it.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.560]   I envy you guys because I feel like I've had to ask the Lord many times, "Help me
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   to see better."
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.120]   Because I don't.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.420]   But even after you see, there is a maturity that has to grow.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.640]   Because I'm going to be honest with you, early on, right when I became Christian, and then
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.440]   I had a pretty dramatic transformation of being super worldly, super arrogant, super
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.760]   fleshly, super given to pleasure.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.200]   And now I'm like, "I want to be servant of God, I want to be all this stuff."
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.880]   But the thing is, once you see certain things, all of a sudden, even that can be exposed
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.320]   to your ungodly character.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.660]   So what happens?
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:19.400]   Someone might say this silly thing like, "You've got to be encouraging, you jerk."
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   Now you might have been able to assess, you might have been able to see and analyze something,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.720]   but your response and your appropriate behavior is not in keeping with the character of God.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.760]   That too has to be discerning.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.560]   That too has to be discerning.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.160]   So I'm going at length at this, but boiling all that down, right now we have investigation,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.280]   analyzing, making a judgment, and making appropriate application.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.240]   These things contribute to the idea of what the scripture would call you as wise.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.880]   Because now you've gained skill and a spiritual sight to be able to assess, to analyze, and
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.240]   then solve through whatever application, whatever appropriate response there should be.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.800]   That is a skill in living the Christian life.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.280]   That is faith in action.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.280]   And the scripture says you need to be ever growing in this.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.360]   The scripture says you need to be practicing this.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.300]   The scripture says you need to be wanting this for your life.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.160]   You need to be wanting this more than jewels, basically more than money, more than stature,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   more than good name.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.720]   For to be wise is a great, grand privilege of the Christian.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:41.080]   And so, I hope we did an okay job right now thinking through what is discretion and wisdom.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.860]   Now we move to why is it so important.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.860]   Why is it so important?
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.280]   And we have a couple points here.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.840]   A, because when you're not exercising discretion in a godly manner through the Bible, you are
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.680]   still exercising judgment but through your flesh.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.080]   Let me repeat that.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.760]   It's so important because when you're not exercising discretion and judgment through
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.720]   the scripture and the standard of God, you are still exercising discretion and judgment
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.480]   but through your flesh.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   Okay?
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.720]   So, tangible example, there have been times when I've been in conflict with certain people
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   and then I have a hard time analyzing like, "Oh my gosh, who did wrong?
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   What did I say?
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   What did she say?
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.640]   Like, what am I supposed to do?
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   What's the right thing?
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.640]   Am I being selfish?"
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.680]   There's so many questions, right?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.800]   Okay.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.280]   In that, my flesh starts to come out.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.200]   I can start getting, what, bitter, resentful.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.440]   I can start wanting revenge.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.200]   I can start having malice in my heart.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.880]   So guess what?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.200]   If the word of God does not intervene and the spirit of God is causing you to evaluate
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.280]   that scenario to see clearly what is selfish, what is right, what is wrong, but then you
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.600]   allow yourself for that time to just go, what's going to happen is your anger is going to
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.720]   make decisions.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.180]   Your emotions will make decisions.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.440]   Your fears will make decisions.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.760]   Your anxiety will make decisions.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.860]   Your hatred will make decisions.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.380]   You will always make a decision in the end.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   So why is it so important?
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:19.000]   It's because so many times, because we're not proactively training ourselves to go through
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.280]   this process of investigating, analyzing, judging, and then making appropriate application,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.260]   now we're simply allowing our flesh to reign.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.600]   Do you guys agree?
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.080]   I've seen it in myself, right?
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.360]   I've seen it in myself.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.340]   And I see that as a problem for a lot of people as well.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:49.880]   But what's more, scripture is very clear that when you do not practice spiritual discernment,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.080]   then you will ruin yourself.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.720]   You will ruin yourself.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.520]   That's letter B. You will come to ruin.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.680]   Now it's one thing to be like, "Hey guys, we need to mature."
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.240]   And if you're not reading your Bibles and looking at the world through the lens of the
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.280]   scripture and you guys aren't making decisions that are wise, then you're just not maturing
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   all that much.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   Right?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.800]   Which is very true.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.480]   If you're not maturing in your ability to discern, "This is wrong, this is right, this
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.920]   is good, this is bad," then you're not maturing.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.880]   But the passage in Hebrews chapter 5 does not present to us a case where the author
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.280]   is just like, "Oh man, I wish you guys would have matured, but we're not there yet, so
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   let's just keep going.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   It's all right."
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.000]   That is not the way he is presenting this case.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.480]   He is presenting this case like, "Since you guys are dull of hearing, I can't talk to
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   you."
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.760]   That's how he's presenting his case.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   And then he's frustrated.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.000]   He's like, "I can't talk to you."
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And then he says, "Although you should have been mature enough to teach even, not to say
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.120]   that everybody should be a leader, but mature enough to guide somebody else, to impart this,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   to carry this on.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.480]   You're like a pro and you should have been able to transfer this to the next rookies
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   or whatnot."
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.160]   Right?
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   What does he say?
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   "Hey, just keep at it, keep going."
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.280]   No, he says, "What you've done is, you should have been here, but you're now what?
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   Infants.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   You've got nothing.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.440]   It's not like you had building blocks and then you're up here.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.560]   It's been destroyed."
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.040]   And the best way I can talk about this is this.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.400]   If you go your life without having discretion for a certain amount of time, trying to practice
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.080]   that discretion all of a sudden is not going to work.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.920]   Recently, our church's BBA season started.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.480]   It's a really exciting time for our church.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.960]   So right now I don't play.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.200]   I'm really into it.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.720]   So every time I get a chance, it's like, "Hey dude, how'd the draft go?
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   Whose team are you on?"
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.440]   And like, "Dang, your team is stacked."
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440]   And then all this kind of stuff.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   There's a lot of talk.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.440]   Okay?
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.240]   And then I played BBA before, but right now I'm not going to play.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.320]   And here's the reason why.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.480]   Because a couple of years ago, I took a year off from BBA, maybe two years off from BBA,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.020]   but all of basketball too, because I had kids and life was busy and I just couldn't play.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.020]   So a year goes by.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   I'm not playing ball.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.020]   I'm exercising.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.120]   But then I want to go play.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.760]   So I go play with all the guys that are running full court.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.280]   First two minutes I feel great.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   Second two minutes, my lungs feel like they're burning.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.040]   It's just like, "Why is it so hard to breathe?"
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.720]   And then maybe like 20 minutes into it, I didn't even play like three, four games or
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   anything.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   20 minutes into it, I'm playing.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   I'm running down.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Someone else has the ball, right?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   My teammate has the ball.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.880]   I'm running down and nobody's around me because nobody's even playing defense yet.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.880]   Right?
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.080]   So I'm just like, "Ah!" and I go down to the floor.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.600]   And everyone's like, "Oh, did you sprain your ankle?"
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.960]   I'm like, "I don't know what's wrong.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.440]   I can't move my calf muscle."
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.480]   Like down here, it was just really hard.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.440]   So everybody's kind of like, "Uh, you know, what happened?"
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   So I'm like, "I don't know.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   I don't know."
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.400]   So I'm kind of hopping off to the sideline.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.040]   I think a lot of you guys are there with me.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.400]   So I'm hopping off to the sideline and then I'm like, "Oh, my other calf!"
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.740]   So I go to the floor and I'm like holding my calves.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.020]   And then like two days later, my wife's like, "Look at your calves.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.720]   They're purple all the way down from the back of my knees to my ankle.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.280]   It's just purple."
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.000]   And then she looked up her little bio book and was like, "You have like a third degree
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   strain on your calves."
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.080]   Basically, you know, like I didn't work my calves out.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.480]   So I like overstrained it and then now the capillaries burst and I'm bruising inside.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   Right?
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.240]   So I was like, "Yeah."
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   You know?
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.300]   Anyway, I share that with you because there's pretty much nothing in your life where you
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.740]   can take many time, like months off or you're not practicing it and then all of a sudden
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.580]   a major event happens like, "Dude, I need to perform right now."
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.100]   What can you do that with?
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.260]   Even your education, you don't use some of your stuff for like a little while and it's
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.740]   like, "Did I even learn that?
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.020]   I don't remember taking a class sometimes."
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.340]   You know?
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:26:00.560]   So the fact of the matter is, the way that he's describing it is, in your discretion,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.420]   you need to be engaged in this, growing in this and loving the scriptures and the wisdom
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.680]   of God because if you do not, it's not as you're going to stay stagnant or you're not
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   going to grow.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   You're going to decay.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.540]   Do you see my point?
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.720]   You're going to decay.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.920]   And so scripture says that this is so important for us to heed the admonition of scripture
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.840]   that we need to love wisdom and discernment.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:32.960]   By way of a couple warnings, by way of a couple warnings, in Hosea chapter 4 verse 6 it says,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.860]   "My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge."
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.320]   Because in some ways it says here, they reject knowledge or since they have forgotten the
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.640]   law of the Lord.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.820]   That's Hosea 4, 6.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.880]   In Jeremiah chapter 5 verse 4, God calls them fools.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.160]   They are fools for they do not know the way of the Lord.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.480]   Right?
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   There is this, there is this idea that for generations, the people of God have been grieving
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.320]   the heart of God.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.400]   How?
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.200]   They were not exercising discretion.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.100]   They weren't careful.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.780]   They weren't going to God asking like, God, is this okay?
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.780]   Is this right?
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:16.520]   Now, I don't know if you've become accustomed to your like corporate life and so you know,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.560]   you've kind of bought into this idea that like I should be a self starter.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.520]   I should be a problem solver.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.680]   I can't go to my boss every single time for every single question, you know?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.160]   And so you've kind of bought into this idea that even in your life you just got to work
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.440]   hard, you just got to sit there, work it out, and then think about it, and then make a decision,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.720]   and it's going to be okay, right?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.600]   Is that the way God has called us to behave concerning this topic?
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.180]   No.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.360]   God has told us you're absolutely dependent on every single step of the way.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.960]   You need to pray, and you need to ask, and you need to seek the wisdom of God, and you
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.040]   need to inquire even if it feels like, hey, it's just an issue of what do I do about this
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   one girl I like?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   What do I do about these multiple jobs and opportunities I have?
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.760]   What do I do about church decision?
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   Because a lot of you guys right now are in church decision.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:13.760]   Did you ask God and inquire of the Lord?
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.240]   Because that's the first step of wisdom.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.360]   That's the first step of discretion.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.960]   Even if you already anticipate, what's God going to tell me?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.280]   Even if in your mind, your fleshy mind, you're already anticipating like, I don't know, if
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.840]   I go out and ask my pastor, he's always going to say the same thing.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.520]   I don't know if I do this and that.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.720]   I can already anticipate what's going to happen, even if, and even then.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.180]   We need to inquire of the Lord because that is our first step towards wisdom.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:50.500]   So I hope we've tried to rightly or I guess thoroughly address why it's so important to
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.100]   seek and strive for wisdom.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.520]   The last, sorry, I'm going to add one more thing to that of why we need to strive for
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:04.820]   wisdom is because in as much as maybe some of us have tried so hard to insulate ourselves
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:11.340]   in the Christian community, you are always going to be attacked by falsehood.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.220]   Let me say that again, okay?
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.060]   No matter how much you try to protect yourself and no matter how safe you feel like you are,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.300]   you are always going to be attacked by falsehood.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.800]   Let me give you a wake up call to reality.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.020]   We are at Berean Community Church and our reputation has been we're trying to be as
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.540]   biblical as possible, right?
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   And I love this church.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.660]   I love the vision of this church.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.100]   I've bought into the vision of this church.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.180]   I've been a member here for 16 years or more, you know.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.860]   I love this church, okay?
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.740]   I want to preface that because the next thing I'm going to say is kind of like, what?
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.420]   Within this church, you're going to be attacked with falsehood.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:00.860]   Within this church, maybe you'll run across people, maybe you'll run across other individuals
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.180]   who in certain moments are walking in the flesh.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.180]   And as they walk in the flesh, they'll try to drag you down with them because that's
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.460]   how the flesh operates.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.420]   Misery loves company, so does sin, right?
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.340]   But the main point and the reason why I say that in terms of even within this church,
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.980]   you're going to be attacked with falsehood is because the falsehood is right here.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.260]   In you, there are times in which false thoughts come up.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.700]   I don't know how many times maybe someone has done something and they're like, "I feel
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.180]   judged by this church."
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   Really?
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.060]   Did someone come over and like, "What are you doing?
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   Why are you doing that?
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060]   Why are you wearing that?
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.060]   Why did you say that?"
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.060]   Did someone do that to you?
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.060]   It's like, "No."
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.060]   Then why?
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:48.780]   It's like, "I just feel that way."
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.700]   But no one's ever said anything to you, right?
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.700]   It's like, "Yeah."
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.100]   I think you lied to yourself.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   That's how I respond.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.460]   I think you lied to yourself.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.740]   You told yourself, "That guy looked at me with judgmental eyes, therefore he judged
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.100]   me, and now I feel judged.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.660]   I'm judged."
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.900]   So the only person who says, "I judged you," or "You are judged," is yourself.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   That's a lie to yourself.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.900]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.420]   There are lies in your own mind.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.560]   There are lies in other people.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.220]   This is the battle of Christian faith.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.660]   We're trying to fight falsehood and truth.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.660]   What is reality?
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:28.100]   Spiritual reality versus the facade of reality that we see with our physical eyes.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.900]   And this battle is going to happen no matter how safe you feel here in your home, no matter
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.300]   how much, again, you've protected yourself by only having good friends, good people,
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.340]   and how this world has tried to convince you, you can only surround yourself with people
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.020]   who are going to make you happy and support you and stuff like that.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.620]   Is that what the Bible says?
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.620]   No.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.620]   Okay?
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.340]   No matter how much you've bought into that, you're never safe from falsehood in this life.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:56.100]   As long as you live here on earth, you are in danger.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:01.860]   Externally, internally, we need to practice wisdom and discernment.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.860]   That's why.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   Okay?
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.860]   So now, how do we obtain this wisdom?
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.720]   How do we go about seeking it?
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.420]   First and foremost, we need to ask for it like Solomon did.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.140]   We need to ask for it like Solomon did.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.580]   Please turn your Bible over to 1 Kings chapter 3.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.980]   Okay?
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.100]   This is just a case example.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:30.780]   Before Solomon was like, "Oh, wow, he's the wisest king of all the area," and people were
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.860]   like the queen of Sheba was coming around like, "Man, I've heard of your wisdom."
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.060]   Before he was all that, he was just a wee child.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.740]   This is what the scripture says about it, 1 Kings chapter 3.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:49.700]   In the transition between King David and King Solomon, I'm going to read verse 10 through
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.700]   14.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   But this is what it says.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.700]   I think I lost my place again.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.220]   No, this happened first service too.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   Sorry.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.820]   Going to have to find my place here in the scripture.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   Okay.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:07.180]   Well, for the sake of context here, we'll just start reading from verse 3.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.300]   It says this, "Now Solomon loved the Lord."
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.300]   Okay?
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.580]   Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statues of his father, David, except he sacrificed
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.700]   and burned incense on the high places.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.380]   So there's a lot of things that Solomon was doing right, but there was a lot of things
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.540]   he was doing wrong.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.260]   "The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for there was a high priest."
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   Sorry.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.260]   "There was the great high place.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.300]   Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.740]   In Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream that night, and God said, 'Ask what
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.020]   you wish me to give you.'"
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.020]   Wow.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.020]   Okay?
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.420]   I just want you guys for just a moment just to imagine with me, so you can drop yourself
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.140]   down into the context.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.140]   Okay?
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.260]   Just first imagining King David was known as the greatest king for the nation of Israel.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.220]   He's the man after God's own heart.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.780]   He's a young boy who, when he was a young boy, defeated Goliath in front of the armies
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.660]   of the Philistines and all this kind of stuff.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.700]   Now imagine yourself to be the successor of that man.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   You're just a small child.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.380]   I actually don't think he's like a small, small child in this passage, but nonetheless,
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.380]   you're young.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.540]   You don't have experience, and you're about to fulfill one of the greatest seats known
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.540]   to your kingdom.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.980]   Okay?
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.940]   And then God says, "What do you want to ask me?"
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:19.940]   That's crazy.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:20.940]   That's just crazy.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.940]   Okay?
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.740]   And then in verse six, it says, "Then Solomon said, 'You have shown great lovingkindness
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:31.340]   to your servant David, my father, according as he walked before you in truth and righteousness
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.340]   and uprightness of heart towards you.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.620]   And you have reserved for him this great lovingkindness that you have given him a son to sit on his
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.540]   throne as it is this day.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:46.260]   Now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David, yet I am
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.540]   but a little child.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.620]   I do not know how to go out or come in.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.460]   Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people who
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.980]   are too many to be numbered or counted.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.260]   So give your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, to discern," here's
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.140]   our term, "between good and evil.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.020]   For who is able to judge this great people of yours?"
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.260]   That is quite challenging to me.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:18.140]   Because honestly, there is a question right now that is evaluating my heart.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:24.380]   When you are in moments of dire, whatever it may be, transition, need, suffering, difficulty,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:31.140]   whatever that may be, big moments in your life, what do you pray for?
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.780]   What do you pray for?
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.340]   Do you pray for the material blessings of money?
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.420]   If I had this, if I had that, if I had this, if I had that?
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.040]   Is it such an easy solution?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.380]   If I just had what that guy had, if I had what that girl had?
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.820]   Or are you searching for what the scripture says by spirit, by faith we understand that
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.740]   wisdom and discretion is more valuable than gold or silver and so seek for it in this
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.020]   way.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.580]   And when you see the response of God, it challenges hearts even more that God truly does delight
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.260]   in a wise man.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.620]   He delights in a wise man.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.900]   So verse 10, check it out.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.960]   It was pleasing in the sight of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.480]   God said to him, because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself long
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.120]   life, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked for the life of your enemies,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.960]   but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.760]   Behold, I have done according to your words.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.520]   Behold, I have given you a wise, discerning heart so that there have been, there has been
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.440]   no one like you before you nor shall one like you arise after you.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.240]   I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor so that there will not
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   be any among the kings like you all your days.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.520]   If you walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and commandments as your father David walked,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.160]   then I will prolong your days.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.440]   That's so cool, right?
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.920]   What God is saying was for us, for us, right?
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.320]   We're taught in the New Testament very similar things.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.440]   We are.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.820]   My first point essentially is if you feel like you lack wisdom, you should ask.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.400]   You should ask God.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.880]   You should ask God regularly, intensely, right?
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   And sincerely, you should ask him for wisdom.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.040]   Are any of you guys like me?
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.960]   To tell you honestly, again, for lack of better words, some days I just feel like naive.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.780]   Some days I feel kind of dumb even, you know?
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.800]   And sometimes when we have these team meetings or business meetings or logistics meetings
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.560]   and maybe someone might ask evaluative questions like, "Hey, what do we need right now?"
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.960]   I'm just like, "Hmm, what do you think we need right now?"
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.000]   Because sometimes I feel like I lack that wisdom to discern, to ask and analyze.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.680]   And then maybe sometimes, again, situations arise when people come to me and ask regularly,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.120]   "Hey, Pastor Mark, what should we do?"
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.500]   "What do you think we should do?"
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   Sometimes I feel naive.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.260]   I don't know what to say.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260]   What does Scripture say?
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:20.180]   If you turn your Bibles over to James chapter 1, that in the New Testament, this is a command
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:28.080]   and calling for us too.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.200]   In James chapter 1, I'm going to start reading from verse 2 through 5.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.480]   And it says, "Consider it all joy, my brother, when you encounter various trials, knowing
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.280]   that the testing of your faith produces endurance."
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.040]   So the people he's talking to are experiencing a huge amount of persecution.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.340]   They're experiencing difficulties in their lives that which probably you and I cannot
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.780]   even relate to.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.140]   Because they have, later on it'll say, the confiscation of their belongings.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.760]   They had the splitting up of their family and people were being scattered all around
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   the region.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.120]   And then verse 4, "And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect,
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.920]   complete, lacking in nothing."
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.280]   But, so this is all connected, right?
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:14.960]   "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all generously and without reproach,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   and it will be what?
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.280]   Given to him."
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.360]   This is an area and field to which I feel like I've wrestled and struggled needlessly
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.680]   for a long time when I should have been asking God.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.440]   And were there moments in your life, whether it be decisions, again, of your personal relationships,
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:41.280]   decisions of practical jobs, schooling, whatever it may be, do you ask the Lord, "God, in
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.280]   these moments, my friends have opinions, I have opinions, there's things I want, there's
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   things my parents want, there's things that everybody and anybody expects of me.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   Lord grant me wisdom in this.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.280]   Grant me direction and clarity."
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:04.320]   I hope, just imagine that every single one of us start to practice life that way.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.700]   Can you imagine a community of believers where we're starting to become truly in the biblical
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.000]   sense of one mind because we're going through this process of wisdom and discernment, asking
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.120]   the Lord, asking the Scriptures, analyzing the situation, making a judgment call, and
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.960]   being strong about it.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.600]   Can you imagine what the church would be like as a whole?
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   Right?
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.360]   We would be moving together in such tremendous ways.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.560]   But what's more, first and foremost, we need to ask with this kind of humble heart.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.580]   I find that when King Solomon is asking, you see his tone.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.800]   He says this, he says, "I'm a child, okay?
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.760]   I don't even know how to go in and go out."
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   That's what he says.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.400]   He says, "I don't know the going in or going out."
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.520]   It requires a level of that kind of humility for us to ask.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.040]   There was this one time I was working as a legal specialist.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.120]   I had no background in it and I just got a job.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.680]   After seminary, I just got this job and I was super thankful.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.160]   It was one of the most cool times that I had.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.320]   Great coworkers and stuff like that.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.280]   As a legal specialist, basically I was handling all the lawsuits.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.360]   I was handling all the paperwork.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.400]   I was collecting it, categorizing it.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.000]   And then whenever there were signatures needed, I would take these really sensitive documents,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.640]   take them over, have them signed by our president, all this kind of stuff.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   I was pretty young.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.400]   I think I was maybe 25, 26 at the time.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   So I was pretty timid.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.280]   One time, we're under lawsuit by Samsung.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.400]   We were an electronics company under a lawsuit by Samsung.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.240]   We get these huge files.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.480]   And then I had to get this document signed by the president.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.240]   But then for some reason, I read VP.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.080]   So I went over and I had the VP on.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.480]   I was like, "Hey, you need to sign this."
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   And he was like, "What is this?"
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.320]   And I was like, "Oh, I got it sent over from the legal counsel.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   Can you sign it?"
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.520]   And he had to initial every page and then he signed it.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.760]   And then I came back and the legal counsel was like, "Oh, shoot.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.160]   This is all time sensitive stuff.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.800]   We can't just make regular copies of it.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.920]   You have to go and contact and then have the president sign and then explain to the VP
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.440]   why you had him sign something he didn't know what he was signing."
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.760]   And I was like, "Oh, shoot."
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.800]   So here I am holding the thing.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.600]   And I'm not sure if you guys have ever done this where you're timid.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   There's fear in your heart.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.080]   So you kind of go through this door and you're like, "Nope, I'm not going in there."
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.680]   And then you go back and forth and you go back and forth.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.520]   And then you're kind of looking to see, "Maybe that guy can do it."
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:42.920]   And I bring that up because every time that we have something of a decision to make, there
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:49.840]   is always going to be an element where you want to defend and preserve yourself.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.360]   Always.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.040]   That ugly head always tends to rear itself.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.080]   But thankfully, King Solomon in this moment said, "You know what?
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   I don't know.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.640]   God, the truth of the matter is, right and left, I don't know.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   So can you please give me this wisdom?"
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.000]   It takes that kind of humility and willing to come before God.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.120]   And I want to encourage you, when you ask both people and God to exhibit that kind of
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.840]   humility so that that kind of instruction can be given you.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.960]   I want to challenge those of you, if those of you are in this room who have that kind
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.360]   of unteachableness, you have a little bit of stubbornness, where let's say someone comes
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.600]   over to try to give you instructions, like, "I know what I'm doing."
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.880]   And especially if that person is younger, you feel like that person doesn't know as
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.440]   much and you're just like, "Dude, I know."
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.120]   If that's your typical MO, like that's how you operate, let's make sure we humble our
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   hearts.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.520]   There are a lot of things we don't know.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.440]   And even if we did know, we could always learn, right?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.200]   That's the admonishment for the first wing.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.020]   How to get wisdom, you ask and you ask humbly.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.520]   Last point.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.440]   Last point.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:12.400]   The passages that we read made it very clear that the discretion and wisdom that God desires
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.280]   for us to have, it must be trained and exercised.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   Okay?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.840]   So the last point is this.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.120]   The wisdom and discretion that we're supposed to exhibit in our lives as Christians, it
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.840]   must be trained and exercised.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:31.240]   Coming back to that passage in Hebrews chapter five, I'm going to read verse 14.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:37.480]   That passage says this, "The solid food is for the mature, for those who have their
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:44.640]   powers of discernment trained by what constant practice to distinguish good and evil."
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   What does he say?
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   There is going to be a practice by which when you do it, you're going to have a better idea,
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.480]   better capacity to say, "That is wrong.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   That is right."
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.520]   You're going to be better skilled, maybe even quicker to come to judgment.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.400]   You're going to be able to better analyze because you've been doing it.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.760]   You've had your eyes open.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.160]   You've assessed stuff in your life.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.480]   And so even when your own emotions come out, it's not like, "Oh, what is this emotion I
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.680]   have?"
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.920]   I know what that is.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.160]   I've dealt with it before.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.000]   I've trained myself to think through those emotions.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.640]   Are we going to have battles of emotion, different thoughts?
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Yes.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.680]   But we're going to have regular training where we will address those things appropriately.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:30.080]   I want to highlight for you an interesting passage that comes from Titus chapter 2.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.560]   Titus chapter 2 verse 11.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.760]   If you guys can go there.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.440]   Titus chapter 2 verse 11, as he's talking about the grace of God.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.960]   He just got finished talking about how we're not saved by words, but we're saved by grace.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.640]   And then here in chapter 2 verse 11 of Titus, this is what he says.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:55.520]   He says, "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all the people."
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   Amen.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520]   Praise God.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   Okay.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:05.400]   But then he says, "Training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.320]   self-controlled upright godly lives in this present age."
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   Wow.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.800]   He uses the word training in terms of what the gospel and the grace of God that has come
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.840]   to us is supposed to do in our lives as we live in here in sanctification until the time
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.240]   of Christ's coming.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.520]   He says the expectation is that the gospel does not simply cause you to pacify your guilt.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.080]   It does not simply cause you to sit there and feel like, "I'm okay with God."
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.480]   Those are all great and grand truths that I don't want to minimize.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.240]   I just want to highlight that right now.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.040]   What he's saying is, this grace actually trains you.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:50.240]   This grace actually allows you to see, to analyze, to judge, and then to make appropriate
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:56.600]   applications according to the grace of God so that you can be godly.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.760]   This is what God expects of you.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:03.640]   To practice, to exercise your capacities for discernment.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:10.780]   There are times in which, again, I think people sometimes have a hard time with this because
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.560]   it is so hard to deny ourselves.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.880]   It's just so hard to fight against the desire of what I want.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.280]   So many times, sometimes when I counsel individuals, I'll walk them through and I'll say, "Hey,
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.600]   I think," or maybe I'll start off with, "What do you think you need right now?
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.680]   What is it that you think you really need?"
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   They'll give an answer.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.240]   I'm like, "Good answer."
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.720]   Then there's this question of, "What do you think you should do then?"
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   They'll answer.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   I'm like, "Good answer.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   Good.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   Good answer."
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.720]   That's typically how I counsel people.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.720]   I ask them questions.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   "What is it?
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   What do you think you need to do?
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.720]   What is the right thing?
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   What does God say?"
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   Then I'll ask that question.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   I'm like, "Okay.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   So are you going to do it?"
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   It's like, "I don't know.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.880]   I got to take time to think.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.040]   I got to take time to process."
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.080]   But what you realize is, no, it's not an issue of you need to think more, you need to learn
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.840]   more, you need to process things more.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.200]   In terms of process things, you already know what is right, what you should do, how to
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.960]   do it.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.040]   What's the issue?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.440]   I haven't asked, "What is it you really want?"
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.840]   Because in that moment, what you're battling is, "I know what's right.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   I know I should.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.840]   I know how, but that's not what I wanted."
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.120]   Right?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.480]   And I bring that up now in terms of the idea of training.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.840]   Because if you look through every epistle, the main facet of wisdom and discernment that
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.220]   you need to first exercise is the discernment and wisdom in training yourself to say no
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.540]   to your flesh and to say yes to the spirit.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.000]   To say no to your own personal, private desires and to say yes to the desires of God.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.300]   If this is what God desires, then this of what I want needs to take the back seat.
[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.140]   Go back there.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:03.540]   But that exercise of doing that, that requires regular practice.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.580]   The more that you practice giving into your flesh, the harder it becomes to exercise those
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.820]   muscles of exercising wisdom and discipline.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:15.820]   I want to wrap up by saying this.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:23.540]   The Lord Jesus Christ, in what he has afforded to us, we think of it in terms of many different
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.420]   facets of the gospel.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.060]   Redemption, reconciliation.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.260]   Right?
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.300]   But remember in the Gospel of John, as it described Christ coming down.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.700]   Do you remember how it described Christ?
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.420]   The light.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.100]   The light of men came.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.820]   Right?
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:48.420]   And what happened was that as the light of the men came, many men did not recognize it,
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.240]   did not concede to it.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.060]   My challenge essentially today is this.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.260]   When you even think about the gospel, the great privilege of what Christ has done is
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.820]   all of that redemption, all of that reconciliation plus more.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.820]   What is that more?
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.420]   He's given us light to be wise.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:12.220]   He's given us truth to be like him, to exercise judgment, to be like him in way of both mind
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.500]   and heart.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.020]   And so if we are not growing and desiring of this, there is a sense in which we are
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.700]   not becoming like Christ.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.180]   We will always be infantile.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:29.020]   So just like the scripture says in the book of Proverbs, wisdom calls out.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.540]   Wisdom is even calling you.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.140]   Go seek it more than treasure.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:40.020]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.820]   Father God, we want to thank you for the challenge from your scripture today.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:51.260]   And I pray Lord that you would continue to inspire within us a desire to walk according
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:58.340]   to your pattern, the desire to be striving after the full measure of Christ.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:04.020]   And Lord, as we think about how our Lord and Savior was so wise, so truthful, I pray we
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.620]   would be the same.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:11.820]   God, we confess that there are many times that we go through the ups and downs of life
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.380]   in such a kind of nebulous way.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.300]   A lot of times we feel lost.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:24.620]   But I pray Father God that as those who have such a great privilege to come to your throne,
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:29.860]   that Lord we would truly come to you asking the Lord of all wisdom to guarantee us direction
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:30.860]   and insight.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:36.940]   And Lord, again, would you cause us to be faithful children, teachable children, wanting
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.220]   and desiring your instruction into our lives.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.460]   Father, we thank you.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.700]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.100]   Amen.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.420]   (crackling)
