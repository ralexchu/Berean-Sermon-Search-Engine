[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   - Good morning, welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   Let me get started with a few announcements.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   First of all, our welcome lunch for newcomers
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   is happening next Sunday at 1 p.m.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   in the other building, the cry room.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   And if you are new to the church
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.640]   and you have some questions
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   and you wanna just meet some of the servants in the church,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.640]   that's a great opportunity to do that.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   So if you go on the church Facebook page
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   or just go to the welcome table
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   and just let them know that you're interested in coming,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   and they'll make sure that they have enough seating
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   for that next Sunday.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   Family ministry, again, those of you
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   who are not FAM245 and not Jubilee,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   and that's pretty much everybody else in between,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   next Sunday, sorry, Saturday at 10 a.m.,
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   there's gonna be a family ministry roll and stroll.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   Our brother Michael Chang is in charge of that,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   so if you wanna come participate,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   more information will be on the website
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   in the church app, so please visit that,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   and that's happening this Saturday.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   All church retreat, early registration
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   is gonna be closed this coming Sunday.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   So if you haven't registered and you are planning to go,
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   please do that as soon as possible, today if possible.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   Then next Sunday, we'll close the early registration,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   and after that, we're gonna have regular registration,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   which means it's gonna be a bit pricier
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   than it would be before if you do it earlier.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   So if you haven't done so,
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   please do that as soon as possible, today if possible.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   And then men's ministry, our quarterly men's ministry
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   is taking place on May 13th at 9 a.m. to lunch,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   and again, that's $10 for the lunch,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   and we'll gather together and wrestle
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   with certain things that are pertinent to men.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   So that's happening on May 13th.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   VBS, July 10th through the 14th
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   is the dates that are set for the VBS.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.640]   If you have children that you are going to send to that,
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   please sign up for that as soon as possible,
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   and they are still, I think, still looking for more volunteers,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   or they said...
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   Okay, I think they said they're set, okay?
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   Unless you want to come and just take the trash out,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   you're more than welcome to do that.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   They always need more help for that, okay?
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   One last thing.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   As I mentioned last week, we are having a special...
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.640]   Okay, this is a Korean flag.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   So some of our students who are going out to Korea
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   sacrificed their sleep and their grades
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.640]   to be able to make these flags.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   So you'll see.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   So these are being sold for $10,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   and then along with it, you'll have a hot dog
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   and homemade chili, okay?
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   So as I mentioned last week,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   as you go out, you probably saw them already.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   There's going to be hot dog stations,
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   and some of you guys saw those, you know,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   market canned chili over there,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   and then you were basically calling me a liar,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   saying that it's not homemade.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   None of those cans were opened, okay?
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   You can go check.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   It was--everything you're going to taste is homemade.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   So there's three separate people
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   who made these homemade chilies,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   and they're going to taste a little bit different,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   and we're not going to tell you which one they are,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   but in my opinion, all three of them
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   have their own little flavor, and it tastes great.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   It's worth $20, but we're going to be selling it for $10 today.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   So as you're going out, again,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   those of you who are members in the church,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   we have a members meeting today at 1:30,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   so if we give you time to go out and get the hot dog,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   eat it in the cafe,
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   there's going to be tables set out in the middle,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   so you can eat that.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   Again, even if you're not a member,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   you just want to buy that and then just eat it here,
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   you're more than welcome to do that.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.640]   Those of you who are going home immediately afterwards,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   it is going to be boxed with a lid,
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   so you can also just take it with you, again,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   and each hot dog will have these flags, okay?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   Again, for those of you, just a reminder,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   we have a team of 20 people
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   who are going out to Korea this summer.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   Again, some people may think,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   "Well, Korea's an evangelized nation,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   "so why do we need to send missionaries out to Korea?"
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   IMB, our denomination,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.640]   has relabeled Korea as a mission-receiving nation.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   Just in the last 100 years, Korea had a huge revival,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   and Christianity went from 1% to 33%
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   in about 100 years,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.640]   especially after the Korean War in 1950,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   but in recent study, they found out that Gen Z,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   the Gen Z generation,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   has dropped from 33% to less than 3%
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   within a matter of a couple decades.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   And so they're very concerned
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   about where Christianity is headed,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   and so our missionary contacts
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   have been asking us to come and join them in ministry
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   and reaching out to the college students,
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   the college camp, the younger generation there,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.640]   and so because we have a lot of young people at our church,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   and they are more open to talking about their faith
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   to non-native Koreans,
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   'cause they have a very negative view of Christianity in Korea,
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   but they're open to Christianity outside of Korea,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   so we're kind of in a perfect position
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   to be able to go there and help them out,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   and so we're hoping that our first year there
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   will open the doors,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   and we'll see if there's further work that we can do, okay?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   So that's why we're going out there,
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   and so the funds that we're raising,
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   will be used for that purpose, okay?
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   So let me pray for us.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   We'll give you a minute to give your offering,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   and then those of you who have physical,
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   again, we have a box in the back as you're heading out.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   It will be available, all right?
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   Let's pray.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   for the grace that we know,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   especially for the grace that we don't know,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   how you sustain us,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   and how you orchestrate all things
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   for the purpose of good to draw us closer to you.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   We pray that you would help us
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   throughout the worship, Lord God,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   that you would focus our attention,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   that you would set our mind and our heart
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   in a place where it needs to go,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   that our hope and our labor
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   would not be for temporal things,
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   but for eternal things.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   So we pray, Father God, that even in this giving,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.640]   help us to give it with a cheerful heart,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   may it be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   Hi, my name is Erica Pipkin,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   and this is my testimony.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   I'm a first year at UCI.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.640]   A little bit of background about me, I grew up in a Christian household,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   but I didn't really consistently go to church until my gap year after high school.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   Also, growing up,
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   I was a pathological liar.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   I can remember lying even as young as four years old.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.640]   Naturally, my parents
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.640]   learned really early on that they couldn't trust anything I said.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   At the time, I felt little to no guilt, but as the years
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   went on, I realized that I wouldn't trust myself either.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   To everyone else outside of my family, I presented myself as
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   the perfect child, the perfect big sister, the perfect student,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   while I knew that I was actually a disappointment to my family
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   and a sinner against the God I claimed to love and serve.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   It wasn't until I was 12 years old that I actually broke under the
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   weight of that sin. I was miserable, constantly in trouble,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   and feeling as if my life was devoid of love.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   Finally, my parents got through to me that the reason my life felt so loveless was because
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   it lacked God. I wasn't spending time in
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   prayer. I wasn't actually chasing him. And that night
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   was the first time I truly asked Jesus to forgive and change me.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   But even though I was saved that night, aside from
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   fighting against the temptation to lie rather than succumbing to it, I didn't do much to walk
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   with God. I wasn't praying consistently. I wasn't reading the Bible. And so,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   of course, I began to drift. High school
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   was really hard. A lot of things happened that
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   made me feel betrayed, unlovable, and worthless.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   I began to think that many people only loved me because I fulfilled a need or a role.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   And when COVID hit, there were many times when I felt
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   so hopeless that I considered the easy way out, even though I put up a mask
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   of happiness to those around me. Finally,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   during my gap year after high school, I became utterly entangled in my own wickedness and sin,
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   and I blinded myself through licentiousness, the justification of
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   sin by the cheapening of God's grace. So, when I came
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   into UCI, I came with a mindset that was utterly depraved.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   But praise God that He led
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   me to a gospel-reaching church.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.640]   He convicted me during the first Korean college
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   Bible study of the school year, making it known that as a Christian,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   I'm called to make Him Lord over my whole life.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   Anything that interferes with my relationship with Him is an idol that I'm
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   sinfully worshiping. And by His strength alone, I was
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   able to cut off those idols and sinful intentions I had coming into UCI
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   so that I could truly serve Him. And that was the first turning
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   point back to God. However, being hurt so many times
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   had caused me to become jaded, and I hadn't even known it.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   Even after redevoting my life to Christ during fall quarter, I trusted no one.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   I felt misunderstood, unseen, and unwanted by people.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   As I distanced myself from my new friendships, I quickly began to feel hopeless and
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.640]   lost in my relationship both with God and with brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   But the Lord brought people into my life.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   He challenged my faith in a good way, and encouraged me to start reading Romans,
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   just when I felt most hopeless.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   God brought me to Romans 5, 1-5, which says,
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   and we exult in hope of the glory of God. And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance, and perseverance proving character,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   and proving character hope, and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   within our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who was given to us.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   After all the darkness throughout high school, the Word gave me the first ray of light I've felt in years.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   It was the first time I experienced the true peace and overflowing joy that the New Testament promises.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   Romans 8, 28 promises that all things work together for the good of them who love God,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:31.640]   and I felt so much peace as he taught me that that good refers not to what I perceive to be best for me,
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   but to the perfect plan that God has in place. His will is what's best for me.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   This year I've been learning more about myself and the God who made me.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   I'm learning to rely on him, to submit to him, and to reflect his love and grace.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   Praise God that he is faithful even though I am not, and that he is still healing me.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   Praise God that he has graciously opened my eyes to the truth of the way and the life in Christ,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   and that I may truly pursue a relationship with my Creator. Thank you.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   [Applause]
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   [Water pouring]
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   Do you understand when you're going into the water, you're united to Christ's death?
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.640]   You're being united to his resurrected life. When I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   [Water pouring]
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   [Applause]
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   Thank you, Erica, for that powerful testimony, and for the gang of college students.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   Thank you for coming and supporting her. If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 5, 27 through 32.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   [Pause]
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   Luke chapter 5, 27 through 32, and reading out of the NASB.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   After he went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in a tax booth, and he said to him, "Follow me."
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   And he left everything behind and got up and began to follow him.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:34.640]   And Levi gave a big reception for him in his house, and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.640]   who were reclining at the table with them.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at his disciples, saying,
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:50.640]   And Jesus answered and said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   Let's pray.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   Father, we come before you asking for your guidance, your teaching, and your Holy Spirit to illuminate, and not just to inform.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   Help us, Lord God, to be changed by your word. Sanctify that our hope may be placed in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   All right, again, let me ask you a question. You don't have to answer it out loud.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   In fact, don't answer it out loud.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   What sin bothers you the most?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   One sin. What sin bothers you the most?
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   I want you to keep that question in your heart as we wrestle through the text of the calling of Levi.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   Levi, according to Matthew 9.9, he's Matthew, the tax collector, the one who writes the gospel of Matthew.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   We don't know when his name change takes place, but we know that this Levi is that Matthew.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   I remember years ago, because we thought, my wife and I thought we were going to be doing full-time homeless ministry.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   I thought it'd be best for me to find out what it's like.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   And I remember one particular Wednesday, I followed a group of friends that I made who are out on the streets.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.640]   And we followed them into a Catholic center.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   And it was known that every Wednesday they would open up to allow the homeless in that area to come and take a shower,
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.640]   get a warm meal, and then if you needed new clothes, they would give them clothes that were donated.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   And so it's a gathering every Wednesday that happens, maybe about 60 to 100 people, and they're always rotating throughout the day.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   And I happened to follow them that day to that center.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   And obviously, I'm the only outsider that was there.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:52.640]   But what I heard and experienced during that time really, really changed my perspective of the ministry that I was involved in.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   What happened while I was there was because they were not in the open, and they were nobody outside of me who was an outsider,
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:07.640]   they were speaking very freely and talking about what their week was like and what Monday was like, Tuesday was like.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   And I saw a group of guys who were huddled out in the corner, began to talk about what they did the night before and the week that led up to that.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   And some of them were talking very openly about how they raped some girls.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   Initially, when I heard that, I, you know, because this is not something that you commonly hear,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   and initially I thought maybe they're exaggerating, maybe they're joking.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   And as I was hanging around and just kind of hearing from the side what was happening,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:41.640]   and started to realize that it wasn't just one person, it was like a culture where this was an acceptable behavior.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:49.640]   And obviously, I was beginning to get very disturbed by what I was hearing when I realized that this is what it's like to be out on the street,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:57.640]   that a girl who is hanging out on the street is an open target, and she knows that this is coming.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   And so there was no sense of remorse, no sense of disgust, it was just a matter of fact that this was the culture.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:13.640]   And it began to dawn on me what I was observing prior to going to that, because whenever we saw a young girl come out on the streets,
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   because I've seen some girls who were 16, 17, 18-year-old young girls, blonde hair, blue-eyed girls,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   looked like cheerleaders at their high school, and then I could just see the natural deterioration,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   because somehow she got hooked on drugs, and then about two, three months later,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   you can just see her physical appearance begin to change, and they're usually men around them, just hovering around them.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   And it was a known fact that if you're out on the street as a young girl, and you don't get connected to some guy as your protector,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   basically you're going to get raped, oftentimes maybe gang raped.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   I was so disturbed and disgusted by what I heard that after that, I would come out to Tuesday, and we would serve,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   and I would see some of these same guys who was in that huddle eating, but prior to that, every time I would eat,
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   it's like, "Oh, these guys have hardship, they're out on the street, and we want to feed them, care for them."
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   But I really had to fight off my disdain for some of these guys, that this is what they do.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   And it was normal for them to be able to do that, and as we're feeding them, as we're trying to share the gospel with them,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   I had to fight this desire to do something.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   And after that, I had to make a rule that the younger girls who were coming out with us, that they're not allowed to leave our little circle.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   Before, they would go out and sit, and they would take the food, and they would go maybe a little bit away to get the food to them.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   And then after that, I was so disturbed by what I heard, I made all the students that I would bring out to the homeless center,
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   like, "You stick right next to me, where if I have to be able to see you, you're not allowed to go out of that."
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   I didn't really explain to them everything that I heard, because I didn't want to disturb them,
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   but I remember wrestling, going out there thinking, "These guys are not good people.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   These guys don't deserve to be loved."
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   The reason why I share this with you is because I want you to emotionally understand what the Pharisees,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   and why the Jews hated these tax collectors so much.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   The tax collectors, these guys were traitors to the country.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   These guys were not theoretically bad people.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   Almost every Jew has been disturbed in some manner because of these tax collectors.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   Romans, because they conquered so much land, they couldn't keep things in order,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   so in order to collect taxes, they used what was called the tax farming.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   Tax farming basically was, they would recruit the locals of whatever land that they conquered,
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   and they would auction off to the highest bidder, whoever wanted to collect taxes,
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   because they knew there was instant success, instant money, instant wealth that would come.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.640]   They would come, and you typically would attract shady people to come, and they would bid,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   and whoever is the highest bidder would get the rights to collect the money.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Now, that in and of itself, you can see how that would attract certain types of people,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   but the way that they did it was, there are two different categories of taxes in this tax farming.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   One was the fixed flat tax, and that was based upon a census.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   Remember when Jesus was being born, Joseph and Mary had to go back to their hometown to be counted in the census,
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   because based upon these census, they would tax the people, and that's a flat rate.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   If you exist, you get taxed, and there's no way to fudge that.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   So that was the flat tax.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   And then they had what's called the duties and tolls tax.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   Duties and tolls tax basically was just a loose set of things that you can tax, and that was spices.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   It could be tomatoes that you had. It could be cloth. It could be the horse that you're riding.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   It could be the road tax. It could be anything that you could imagine that they had the freedom to tax.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   So the way that the Romans did it was they would auction it off.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   Whoever bid, they would require of them the fixed tax to be turned in, and then they would have a certain amount.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   And then once they reached that, everything else that collect that's left over is theirs to keep.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   So this whole system itself was a setup for corruption.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   It was so rare that a tax collector was not corrupt that they would highlight that this tax collector is trustable.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   In fact, they were known to be corrupt that by their own law, they forbid tax collectors to be witnesses in the court of law in the Jewish community.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   They weren't trusted. It was like getting a drug dealer to come and testify.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   He said that because of his proven immorality, we can't trust his testimony.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   That's how the tax collectors were seen.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   They were able to get anybody.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   That's just a maybe you're pregnant, you're on the way to the hospital, and they say you need to pay a road tax and collect money.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   Whatever farming that you had and you collected and you're going out and give it away or sell it, they can stop that and tax it.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   And it was a frequent act that if you were on your way, they would ask you to open up your bags,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   open up whatever you have on your horse, whatever you're carrying, and anything that they saw,
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   they said it could be taxed.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   And if they couldn't pay it, what they would do is pay it out of the generosity of my own heart,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   and I'll pay it to you, and then they would charge them exorbitant amount of taxes or interest,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   which oftentimes they couldn't pay.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   So they would come and they would confiscate your property and take away things.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   So imagine just how much disdain that every single Jew would have encountered a tax collector at some point.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   And then if they couldn't pay the taxes and pay them back, they would hire thugs to go after them.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   And so tax collectors typically were surrounded by thugs and gangsters who were going to do their duty of force the taxes upon them.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   So imagine what they were like.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   And the best places to collect taxes is wherever there's a lot of people gathered together.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   So imagine every time you gather together to go to the synagogue, there's a lot of people there,
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   so there would be a tax booth set up there.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   If you're a fisherman, anywhere you docked, there would be a tax collector sitting there.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   If there was a large road, there would be a tax collector because you know there's a lot of people traveling.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   If there is an arena where a bunch of people are going to come together to be entertained,
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   there would be a tax booth there to collect money.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   In fact, you can see how much they were hated in Luke 18.11.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   It says, "The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   'God, I thank you that I am not like other people, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, even like this tax collector.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   Of all these sinners, detestable sinners, thank God I'm not like this tax collector.'"
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   Matthew 21.32, "For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him."
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   Like all these righteous and upright people, but to highlight the worst of sinners,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   even they believed, they mentioned prostitutes and a tax collector.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   So you can kind of see in their mindset how they viewed tax collectors.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   They hated them. They had disdain for them.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   Matthew 18.17, talking about church discipline, he said,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   "If he refuses to listen to him, tell it to the church, and if he refuses to listen even to the church,
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   A Gentile is somebody who's outside of the kingdom in rebellion, pagans, idol worshippers.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   And he said, "Treat him like a Gentile who's not in the kingdom and like a tax collector."
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   This is how they looked at tax collectors.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   In fact, what's interesting about this is this takes place in Capernaum.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   Capernaum had a large road called via Maris Roman Highway.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   And so this was a place where there was a lot of commerce taking place.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   And as a result of that, there was a lot of money being exchanged back and forth.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   And so whenever they deemed this an important route for the Romans,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   they would send Roman soldiers there to make sure they're protected.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   So a tax collector would have become very wealthy in this place because there's a lot of money being exchanged.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   And the tax collector had the freedom to do whatever he wanted because whatever he did, they had Roman soldiers around.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.640]   So even if the locals hated the tax collector, they couldn't touch them because they were guarded by the Romans,
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   because the road was so important. This is where Levi is being picked up. This is where Matthew is being picked up.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   This is where Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector, resided.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:25.640]   So the fact that they were hated people, and it only highlights even further how much more disdain they may have had toward Matthew.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   But why Levi? Why is this story even here?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   So whenever we study the bio, especially the narratives, we know that Luke is the one who at least made an effort.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   That's what he says in the beginning, that he is writing this letter to Theophilus to give an orderly account of the life of Christ and what has happened.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   It's important for us to note that what happens right before this, because even though it may be two separate stories, it is connected in theme.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   So remember, what did we talk about last week? I know it's last week, and usually you just kind of like,
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:10.640]   you may remember the funny stories, but let's see how many of you remember. What happened last week?
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   The healing of the paralytic. They come, go through all that trouble to get healed, and Jesus says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   And then the Pharisees, "How can you say this? A mere man. Only God can forgive sins." Remember that's what happens?
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   And then so Jesus, as a result of that, knowing what was in their heart, he says, "In order for you to know that I have authority,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins," he says, "get up and walk." And the paralytic is healed.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   And the whole reason why he says he does that is so that you would know that he has power to forgive sins.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   And so if you remember, the paralytic gets up, he glorified God, goes home, the rest of the crowd, they're in amazement,
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   and then fear falls on them because they encounter God, but it tells us nothing about the Pharisees.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   The only thing we are told about the Pharisees is that they had disdain for Jesus for saying that your sins are forgiven.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   And then the very next scene, in verse 27, "After that, he went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax booth."
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   So this is not by accident. He comes out after saying that, knowing it's in their heart, "How can this man blaspheme a mere man,
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   saying your sins are forgiven?" And then he comes out and he sees the vilest sinner, that they would have been disgusted to be even in his presence.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   And what was he doing? He was sitting at a tax booth. He was in the middle of doing his job.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   He was in the middle of collecting taxes. So this is possibly the worst person to forgive, and he doesn't even just forgive.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   He says, "Come, follow me." Makes him his disciple, Matthew.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   This is not by accident, because this was the whole mission of Christ.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   This is the whole mission of Christ, to seek and save sinners. And he chooses the worst of sinners in order to practice this.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   Remember Apostle Paul, when he explains about his calling in 1 Timothy 1, 12-15?
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.640]   He says, "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he considered me faithful, putting me into service."
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   Now if we stop right there, you might say, "Oh, because Paul was faithful, right?
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   Because he was a Jew and he was faithful, and that's why he was called. He earned it."
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   But right after that, it says, "Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor,
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief."
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   Paul's not saying that because he was faithful, he was called.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   He's saying that God called him to be faithful, despite the fact that he was a blasphemer and a sinner.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   And then he goes on to say, verse 14, "And the grace of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all."
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   Paul says the reason why he was chosen is because he was the worst of sinners.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   And why? Why was he chosen? Not because of his great learning, not because of his righteousness,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   but because he was the worst. For what purpose? So that God would receive the glory.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   Not Paul. You know, our natural tendency is, if we see somebody being used, we want to study that man.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   If a church is growing, we want to study that church.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   If something good is happening, what method is he applying? What gifted men are around this?
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   What is happening in this church? And so we want to copy the work of man and then try to reproduce that.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   Because our natural tendency is to give glory to man rather than God.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   So if you just simply say, "You know what? Why is your church growing? Why are you bearing fruit?"
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.640]   It's because, you know, we're just practicing what the Bible says.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   So you don't want to share.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   "But I, of course, I, of course you have to pray. Of course you have to be obedient. Of course you have to study the Bible.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   But what are you doing?" We all do that. But we're not growing, so what are you doing?
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   So we have a generation where we have marketed certain churches that seems to be reproducing.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   If we do what they do, maybe we will produce what they produce.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   So, suddenly, we give glory to man rather than God.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   But Paul says he wasn't chosen because he was a scholar. He wasn't chosen because he had Roman citizenship.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   He wasn't chosen because he was more determined or disciplined or more gifted.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   He said he was chosen for the very opposite reason.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   He said he was chief of sinners.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   In order that people may know that it was God, not man.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   It was all God, not man.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   I'll bet you, if Paul was being honest, and maybe before he met Christ,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   and maybe before he was aware of his own sin and asked Paul, "Who's the chief of sinners?"
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   I think Paul would have said, "Levi."
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   He probably would have said, "The chief, oh yeah, yeah, there's actually one guy worse than me.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   You know, that guy. You know what that guy did for a living?
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   You know the kind of people that he ticked off?
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   You know, this young poor farmer who was going and she only had a few dollars
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   and he came and took all of that. That guy. That guy's the chief of sinners."
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   Remember when they were at the Passover meal, Jesus in his last meal,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.640]   and he says, "You know, the one of you is going to betray me?"
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   And all the disciples are looking around.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   "Who is this?"
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   I'll bet you, inwardly, they were thinking, "Oh yeah, that's Matthew. For sure."
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   Now they didn't want to say it because, you know, Jesus is around,
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   and so they need to be godly and humble,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   but I'll bet you, inwardly, they were saying, "We told you. We told you."
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   Of course he was going to turn. You know who he was before?
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   People don't change. Matthew. It's got to be Matthew.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   They didn't say that, but I bet you some of them were thinking that.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.640]   Matthew was chosen for a reason.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   You say, "Well, Matthew was chosen because he's a tax collector
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   and he would have been a great record keeper,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   and he would have been the best person to write the book of Matthew."
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   All that may be true,
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   but the real reason is to demonstrate what he just told those people.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   "I came to forgive sins."
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   And this worst of sinners.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   Not only did he forgive him, he said, "Come. Come, follow me."
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   And made him his disciple.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   Now why is this so important?
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   Because that's the root of man's sin.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   That disdain for other sinners prevents us from seeing our own sin.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   You know, we always talk about being gracious.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   We need to be full of grace, and we judge other people when they're not being gracious.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   Until you get wronged.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   Until somebody hurts you personally, or your children, or your wife, or your husband,
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   and all of a sudden, justice.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   We can be as gracious as we want to be when it doesn't personally affect us.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   We pass out grace, pass out grace,
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   but when they hurt me, or my child, or my family,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   how dare you allow them to get away with that?
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   We need to do something.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Or sometimes we demand justice.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   We've got to be righteous. We've got to be holy.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   We can't just let them get away with that.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:10.640]   Until the sin happens to somebody that you genuinely love,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   your child, your wife, your husband,
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   then all of a sudden, we're gracious.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   The way we practice grace, the way we practice justice, sometimes,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   is also self-centered.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   It's self-centered.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   We cling to grace when it serves us.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   We cling to righteousness when it serves us.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   As soon as it doesn't serve us personally,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   we can be as generous as we want.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   We can be as righteous as we want.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   See, at the root of our resistance against God,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   the root in that is our self-righteousness.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   See, the sin that is being pointed out to us,
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.640]   to the Pharisees,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   is a struggle that every single one of us have.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   Even in the context of practicing grace,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   even in the context of practicing righteousness,
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   it is self-centered if we're not careful.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   Levi, Matthew, hears the calling.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   He left everything to follow him immediately.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   Everybody was probably shocked.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   How can you call Matthew to follow you?
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   Peter, Andrew, John, I can understand.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   Even Judas, I can understand, at least at that time.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   But Matthew, how are we going to walk with him?
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   How are we going to sleep with him?
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   How are we going to trust this guy?
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   How are we going to go to sleep with this guy,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   this robber, this thug?
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   He beats up people to take money from innocent people.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   How are we going to sleep and rest with this guy on the boat?
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.640]   But of all the people who must have been shocked,
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   my guess is the person who was shocked the most
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   was Matthew himself.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   Matthew himself.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   He knew who he was.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.640]   He knew how people viewed him.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   So the fact that Jesus turned and gave him an opportunity,
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   he was probably weighed down with sin.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   I am not deserving of this.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   No one's going to ever possibly call me.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   When Jesus said, "Follow me," he immediately drops everything.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   In Luke 18, verse 13, when Jesus tells a parable
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   between the attitude of the Pharisee
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   and the attitude of this worst sinner and tax collector,
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.640]   this is what he says.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   The tax collector standing some distance away
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.640]   but was beating his breast saying,
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   "God, be merciful to me, the sinner."
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:47.640]   The vilest of sinners who recognizes his sins and repents
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   is far better off than somebody who kept the law all their life
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   and does not recognize his sin
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.640]   because our righteousness comes from covering of his blood.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   And what invites the covering of his blood
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   is a recognition of our own sins.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   And when we stand before God beating our chest over our own sins
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   is when we are forgiven, when we become righteous.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   He who knew no sin became sin so that we may become
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   the righteousness of God, not my own righteousness
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   but the righteousness of God.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   And what invites that is when we are aware of our own sins.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   As soon as this happens, he invites the other tax collectors to come.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.640]   I mean, think about it from a Pharisee's perspective.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   If one tax collector is that vile,
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   imagine what that would have incited
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   when a bunch of them got together to have a party.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   I know some of you guys can't stand cockroaches.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.640]   Imagine one cockroach.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   Then you open the bathroom doors
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   and there's a swarm of them coming out of your toilet.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   Is that disgusting?
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   Yeah, I wanted you to feel it.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   Imagine, my guess is that Pharisees are looking at the swarm of these cockroaches
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   and like, "What?"
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.640]   They're disgusting.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   You're going to be in the midst of that?
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   See, at this point, he gathers all those people because
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   Matthew is the best one to bring those people to Christ.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   Often, the sinner who has been forgiven
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   is the best witness for Christ
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   because they're more sympathetic and compassionate toward other sinners.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   Those who have been forgiven much, they're more sympathetic.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   Those people who have been walking righteously for a long time
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   or natural inclination is like, "This is disgusting people."
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   It's one thing to be outside the home, but they're invited to our house.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   Matthew was just there himself.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   He's sympathetic toward them because he understands.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   Instead of being disgusted, he's compassionate.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   He understands their plight.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   He understands how people view them.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   They are the greatest witness because they're not just regurgitating information.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   The gospel is presented to them in power by his own changed life.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   Evangelism isn't just learning a set of facts and making sure that we're theologically correct
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   and we get that correct information transferred from one person to another person.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   That's not evangelism.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   The witness that he called us to be is when we are affected,
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   when we are broken for our own sins,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   and we beat our chest because of the filth in us.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   It gives us compassion for other sinners because when we look at them,
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   we see ourselves in their shoes.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   This is who I would have been.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   This is where I was headed if Christ didn't have mercy on me.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:06.640]   And so when we share the gospel, we share about the power of how it changed me,
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.640]   not because I was trained theologically correct.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   I mean, theology is, of course, very important,
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   but transferring information is not what he called us to do.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   He called us to make disciples.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   And in fact, someone who recognizes their plight and their forgiveness tend to be the boldest too.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   They tend to be the boldest.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.640]   In contrast, look at the Pharisees.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   Luke 5, 30, "The Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at his disciples,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   saying, 'Why do you eat and drink with these tax collectors, these cockroaches?'"
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   Instead of seeing the mercy of God, he said, "Why do you do that?
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   Why do you--because we were intrigued and we're considering following you,
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.640]   but if you allow these people to come along you, how can we--if I become friends with you,
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   that means I have to be friends with them too."
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   So they're forced to be in a situation like we--maybe you're the Messiah,
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   but if you're going to have these people follow you, how can we follow you?
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   That's the same response every time in Luke chapter 51 and 2.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   You know the parable of the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son?
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   It all was started because they saw Jesus hanging around with tax collectors and sinners.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   By that time, Jesus had given plenty of evidence as who he is,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   but they just couldn't get over the fact.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   You've given so much proof of who you are, but how could you be with sinners like them?
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.640]   And it's in that context he gives the parables.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   You don't know God.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   If you don't know what I'm doing and you don't know why I'm doing it, then you don't know God.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   Same response in Luke chapter 19, 5 through 7, the chief tax collectors, the Kaos,
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.640]   going over to his house, that this is--if Levi was bad, Zacchaeus was the chief of them.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   How can you possibly do that?
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   This is not new in the New Testament.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   All of a sudden, like, you know, God changes himself.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:19.640]   In Isaiah 65, 5, it says, "Who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am holier than you.'
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   These are the smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day."
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   When a sinner has disdain for another sinner's--because in your eye, their degree of sin is greater than yours--
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   he says, "That's what causes the smoke in his nostrils.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   That's what causes his anger."
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   You know, typically, the way we dismiss our sins and focus on other people's sins--
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   you know the typical language?
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   And I'm not saying every time you say this that that's what you're guilty of,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   but a lot of times we will say this, "I know I'm not perfect."
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   Many of you are already smirking because you know what comes next.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   "I know I'm not perfect.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   I know I'm not righteous.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   I know I'm not perfect."
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   What comes after that?
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:17.640]   "But I know I'm not perfect, but I'm not like them.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.640]   I'm not like him.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   I'm not like this person."
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.640]   So basically what we're doing is, "Yeah, I have sinned, but it's not as bad as theirs."
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   So let's focus on what's really the problem.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   So our natural tendency is to dismiss the sins of our heart--bitterness and anger and rage--
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   that resides in our hearts.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:48.640]   We dismiss that and say, "Well, I know I'm not perfect, but them, but those people, but that guy."
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   And so we have a tendency for righteous indignation for other people's sin,
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   and we have learned to accept ours is not as bad because we're not as perfect.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   "But at least I'm not like that sinner."
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   Tell me if that doesn't sound like a Pharisee.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   "Thank God. I know I'm not perfect.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   Only God is perfect. Only God is holy.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.640]   But thank God I'm not like those swindlers and robbers and prostitutes and tax collectors."
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   Tell me if that doesn't sound similar to sometimes what we do.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:39.640]   This sin of self-righteousness is a problem inside of all of us if we're not careful.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   In Matthew 7, 3 to 5, it says, "Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,'
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.640]   and behold, the log in your own eye?
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye,
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.640]   and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eyes."
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   Now, he's not saying there isn't time for judgment.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   He's not saying that there isn't time for us to recognize what is right and what is wrong.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   But he's talking about somebody who is unaware of his sins.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   Or dismisses his own sins.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   And he says, "Why are you so focused on the sins of other people
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   when you've got a log stuck in your own eye?"
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   You know, it's a log because if you have something stuck in your eye, that's a log.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   Even if it's a little splinter that's stuck in your eye, that's a log.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   But the fact that it doesn't bother you that it's stuck in your eye,
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.640]   that it's impeding your vision, and you've gone through gymnastics to somehow dismiss that.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   Let's not focus on this.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.640]   That's pricking my eyes.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   If it's pricking your eyes, there's blood coming out of yours.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   Let's forget that for a little bit.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   Anybody that's going to encounter you and say, "Look at that guy."
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   Say, "You're bleeding.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:10.640]   You've got something stuck in your eye." Say, "Yeah, I know. I'm not perfect.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   I'm not perfect."
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.640]   We should be concerned about them.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   That's what he's referring to.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   People who are so focused on the shortcomings of other people.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   Jesus responds to them by saying Luke 5, 31-32.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   "And Jesus answered and said to them,
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   'It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   I have not come to call the righteous, but the sinners, to repentance.'"
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   Now, does this mean that the Levites were sinners and Pharisees were righteous?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   Okay, I better answer that correctly.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   Of course not.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   In that statement, he's indicting the Pharisees.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   And his indictment is, "They recognize their sin. You do not.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   They know they're sick, but you do not."
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   He's not saying that they're not sinners. He's not saying that they're righteous.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   The Bible makes it clear. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   Not one sins God. Not even one.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.640]   So he's not saying they're righteous, so we need to go after the Levites since you guys are okay.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.640]   What he's saying is, "You don't recognize that you're a sinner.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.640]   You don't recognize that you're unhealthy.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   You don't recognize the log in your eye."
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:28.640]   So the only people that are going to come to me are the people who recognize they're sinners
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   and in need of a Savior.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.640]   Do you remember why the law came?
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   The law was given to the nation of Israel for 1,500 years.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   For 1,500 years they had the law.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   Do you remember what Paul says that the purpose of the law was?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   To make sin what?
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640]   Utterly sinful.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   Now what does that teach us?
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:05.640]   He patiently waited for 1,500 years for Israel to get that they're sinners.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   For them not to simply say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   I'm not perfect. Yeah, I recognize that."
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   No, so that it would become utterly sinful so that they would be like the tax collectors
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.640]   beating their chests.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.640]   When the Messiah comes, "I am in need of forgiveness. I need a Savior.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.640]   Woe is me. Woe is me.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.640]   I am a man of uncleanness from a people of unclean lips.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   Woe is me." 1,500 years waiting patiently to get them to that point
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   that they recognize that they're in need of a Savior.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   And when Christ comes, He came to collect the people who recognize their sins.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   You know what that means?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   It is very, very, very, very, very, very, very difficult to get sinners to recognize their own sin.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   It's very easy to get sinners to recognize other people's sins.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   Very easy to get self-righteous people to march against other people's sins.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   Very easy to get in a group and point fingers at what other people are doing wrong,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   what other people are not getting right.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   But it is very, very, very, very difficult for sinners to recognize their own sins.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   A church that is filled with self-righteous people is an ugly place to be,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:59.640]   where everybody is uncomfortable with what other people are doing.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   They're not living up to what they ought to do.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   And then it begins to erode the fellowship of the church.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   People don't feel safe to share their weaknesses.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   You highlight what other people are doing is wrong and how we need to change these other people,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   how we need to change the program, we need to change this, so that they can change
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.640]   and fully unaware of what's going on in their own hearts.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   True worship, true fellowship is when we have a room filled with people,
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   a community of people beating their chest.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   I'm unworthy of this grace.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.640]   I'm unworthy of your love.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.640]   I'm unworthy of salvation.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640]   And it inspires in us fellowship, compassion, grace.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   That's the genesis, and that's the foundation of a biblical church.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640]   We need to be careful.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   We need to be careful that we spend more attention on what's going on outside of us
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   and be so dense about what's happening inside of us.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   Let me give you some practical things before we conclude.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   People who are in danger of Pharisees, those who grew up in the church,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:29.640]   because you heard the gospel so often and you repeated it, you went to VBS,
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   you heard it at home, memorized scripture, you've been inoculated by the truth.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   So you measure everything by what you see on the surface,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   not being aware of what's happening in your own hearts.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   You are in danger of Pharisees.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   Those who have been successful in some capacity, maybe in the secular field,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   maybe it was in the church, maybe you've led people to Christ,
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   maybe you were bearing a lot of fruit.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   And as a result of that, your purview of everything going around us is these are people.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.640]   Everybody that you see are people that should follow you so that they may also have success.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:29.640]   And if you're not careful, that slight bit of pride causes you to be dense to your own sins
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   and be so sensitive to other people's shortcomings.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   Those who serve more than other people.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   You're so busy in the background always serving people,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   and then eventually what ends up happening is how come other people are not serving the way I'm serving?
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   And you measure other people by what I'm doing, what they're not doing.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   And then that becomes a stumbling block to you because you see everybody measured by where you're at.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   So if you pray a lot, eventually it turns into why aren't they praying?
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   If you evangelize, eventually it turns into why aren't they evangelizing?
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   If you give a lot, why aren't they giving?
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   If you study a lot, why aren't they studying?
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   So every good work that we give, Satan puts a little bit of pride in,
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   and it turns your good works into comparison and then to disdain for others who are not doing the same.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   And then your good work and praise turns into what's wrong with these people.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.640]   And if you're not careful, that can turn into Phariseeism.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   Those of you who know more than others, you've studied a lot more,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   and you're talking to other people and they don't understand, they don't know as much as you do.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   So your next statement is, "What's wrong with you?
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   Why aren't you studying like I am? Why don't you know as much?
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   Isn't theology important to you?"
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   Every good thing that we do turns into judgmentalism when you stick in some pride in there.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   And you know who are in the greatest danger of Phariseeism?
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   Our leaders. Leaders.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.640]   I know this better than anybody else because I've been a leader in some capacity since I was 19.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   There is a temptation to think that because I'm a leader, I'm more mature than you.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   Because I'm leading in life.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   And people think, "Pastor Peter must be more mature in every area of his life because he's leading. He must be."
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   Being able to exposit the text to you doesn't make me stronger than you.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:59.640]   I'm more experienced than you. I may be more older than some of you.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   But doing this doesn't make me more mature than you.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   This doesn't automatically mean that I pray more than you.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   This doesn't automatically mean that I'm more humble than you.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   Some of you are far more generous than I am.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.640]   Some of you pray a lot more than I do.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   Some of you are much more evangelistic than I am.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.640]   Some of you are so much more giving and serving than I am.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   Some of you are so much more humbler than I am.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   This doesn't make me a spiritual person.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   So the person that is in greatest danger of Pharisaism is leadership.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   Because as soon as you become a leader, you put on this hat of teaching everybody.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   I got to teach you. I got to show you.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   And the moment that you stop becoming a student, you stop growing.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   You spend the majority of your time examining other people and not your own heart.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   If we're not careful.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.640]   You see why this is at the center?
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.640]   You see why this is so important for us to know and to practice this?
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   Because the danger of self-righteousness is the root cause of the decay in the modern church.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   Even when you're right, Satan can easily twist that.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   Just a tinge of pride and you are ruined.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   God is looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   Every sinner who stands before a holy God should be beating his chest.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   Because the stink in me is the closest to me.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   If we're aware.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   Because the faucet in me, I know better than you.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.640]   I know who I am.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   I know how you see me because I'm up here, but I know who I am.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   I know what I struggle with.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   And so if I'm aware of my own, I should be the one more than anybody else beating my chest before a holy God.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   Because he gave me salvation that I did not deserve.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   I didn't deserve it in the past.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   I won't deserve it in the present and I won't deserve it in the future.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   My sin bothers me more than your sins bother me.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   Because it affects me personally.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   If we're not careful, Phariseeism will creep in.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.640]   And once that comes in, we are ruined.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   I want to introduce him that you know very well.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.640]   And I think this goes at the core of modern day problem.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   And I'm going to ask the praise team to start coming up.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   You know, in modern day church, there's a separation between theologians and worship leaders.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   Right?
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   So people who are very passionate and emotional and they're great at leading worship.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   But they're not, they're very loose with their theology.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   But let me ask you a question.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.640]   And don't answer it, okay?
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   Just think of it in your head.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   Would you rather go to a church that is high in theology?
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.640]   I mean, the leaders know the Bible so well.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   They are scholars, they're doctors, they're PhDs in these subjects.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   But they're dry.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.640]   A lot of knowledge, a lot of speaking truth.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.640]   But they tend to be dry.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   Or would you rather go to a church where it's very, people are passionate, crying in worship, and it's just awesome.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   But they're not theologically astute.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   Which church would you go to?
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   Don't answer it because I'm going to end up correcting you.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.640]   Which church would you prefer to go to?
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.640]   Neither.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.640]   Neither.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.640]   Because he didn't say God is looking for people who will worship Him in spirit.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   He didn't say that.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   He said, he didn't say I was going to look for people who will worship Him in truth.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   No, he said he's looking for people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   Dry theology does not honor God.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   Passionate worship that is not centered on the Word of God does not honor God.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   What God desires are people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   You know what's interesting is if you look at the whole hymns that were written in the past,
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.640]   hymns were written by pastors and theologians.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   The most astute, most educated, the people who knew the Bible the best, people who knew the theology the best,
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   they were the most passionate for God and so inspired them to write hymns.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   But for some reason today we have the songwriters in one church and the Bible teachers in the other church
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   as if they are separate.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   But in history, almost every hymn that you know, almost every hymn, not 100%,
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   almost every hymn that you know in the past was written by a theologian or a pastor.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   People who knew the Word of God, knew the truth, but they were broken over their own sins
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.640]   and they were inspired to put it into music.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   Isaac Watts, John Wesley, Charles Wesley, Martin Luther, Robert Lowry,
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   he's the one, a Baptist pastor in the 1850s, wrote "I Need Thee Every Hour."
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   Elisha Hoffman, and I can go on and on and on, but this is a song that I want to sing to you this morning.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   Reverend August M. Toplady.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   Again, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly, but that's how it's spelled.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   1762, a reverend theologian penned this hymn that we all know, "Rock of Ages,"
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   and he wrote it in the midst of a severe storm and in order to preserve his life,
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.640]   he had to hide behind this boulder and waited until the storm passed by.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   And in that, clinging for life, praying to God for survival, he's inspired to write this hymn.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:33.640]   "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee, let the water and the blood,
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   from thy wounded side which flowed, be of sin the double cure, cleanse me from its guilt and power."
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   He's aware of his own sins.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:52.640]   "Lord, cleanse me before change them, before disciple them, before correct them, change me.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   Not the labor of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands, could my zeal no respite know,
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone, thou must save and thou alone.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling, naked come to thee for dress,
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   helpless look to thee for grace, foul eye to the fountain fly, wash me, Savior, or I die.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   While I draw this fleeting breath, when mine eyelids close in death, when I soar to worlds unknown,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee."
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   Let's all stand together for this closing praise.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:39.640]   [ Applause ]
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   [ Music ]
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   >> Rock of Ages.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   >> Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   Let the water and the flood from thy wounded side which flowed, be of sin the double cure,
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:22.640]   save from wrath and make me pure.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:37.640]   Not the labor of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands, could my zeal no respite know,
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:53.640]   could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone, thou must save and thou alone.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   [ Music ]
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   >> Nothing in my hand.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling, naked come to thee for dress,
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   helpless love to thee for grace, foul I to the fountain flout, wash me, Savior, or I die.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:23:05.640]   [ Music ]
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   >> While I draw this fleeting breath, when mine eyes shall close in death, when I soar
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   to worlds unknown, see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages, cleft for me, let me
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   hide myself in thee.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   [ Music ]
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.640]   >> See nothing in my hand.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling, naked come to thee for dress,
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   helpless love to thee for grace, foul I to the fountain flout, wash me, Savior, or I die.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   >> Let's pray.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your word that has been implanted in our mind and our hearts
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   will continue to bear fruit in our lives.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   Help us, Lord God, to see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   Lord, we know your grace.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   We've accepted your grace.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   We've sung, Lord, repeatedly about your grace.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   But teach us, Lord, what it means to truly be under your grace, that we may have compassion
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   for those who are in dire need of you.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   Lord, if there's any self-righteousness in us, help us, Lord God, to beat our chest like
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   the tax collector in need of forgiveness, in need of cleansing, in need of renewal,
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   that we may truly be a community that reflects what you have done for us.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.640]   Wherever you send us this week, help us to be the aroma of Christ.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.640]   May Christ and Christ's name alone be exalted through us and in us.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   >> God sent his Son.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   They called him Jesus.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.640]   He came to them.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.640]   He lived and died.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.640]   To my, my heart.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.640]   An empty grave is there too.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   My Savior lives.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Because he loved me.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.640]   I confess tomorrow.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   Because he lives.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.640]   All fear is gone.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.640]   Because I know.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.640]   He holds the power.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   Because I know.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   He holds the future.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   And life is worth the living.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.640]   Just because he lives.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640]   >> Amen.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.140]   (bell chimes)
