[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.720]   First Timothy-- I've got to get my notes.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.320]   Give me one second.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.360]   I lost my notes.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.960]   There it is.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.560]   That's a preacher's nightmare.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   I don't know--
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.040]   I don't know how many times I dreamt about coming up here
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.280]   and then not having my notes.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.800]   Almost came true.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.280]   Thank you.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.880]   Thank you, God.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.120]   All right.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   First Timothy, chapter 2, 12 through 15.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.280]   And I know some of you guys are looking at the text.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.660]   It's like, wow, this guy's crazy.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.200]   Why would he choose this text for Mother's Day?
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.440]   Hopefully, at the end of the sermon,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.600]   you wouldn't hate me as much.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   First Timothy, chapter 2, 12 through 15.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.040]   "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.680]   over a man.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.040]   Rather, she is to remain quiet.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.800]   For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.360]   And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   and became a transgressor.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.760]   Yet she will be saved through childbearing
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.080]   if they continue in faith and love and holiness
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.040]   with self-control."
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.540]   Let's pray.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.120]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for today,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.320]   especially as we remember and honor our mothers who
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   are laboring and sacrificing so much, Lord God,
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.480]   for our families.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.760]   I pray you would strengthen them, reward them,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.620]   Father God, with your grace, that they would feel loved,
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.560]   Lord God, as they work every single day
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.720]   to take care of our children and our homes.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.760]   I pray that our families, Lord, in our church
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   may be strengthened, that it would
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   be the foundation upon which we build our community.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.600]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing and the Holy
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Spirit to use your word to bless and strengthen and sanctify
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.360]   your church.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   Amen.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.040]   You know, it's kind of awkward every year
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.960]   when we think about Mother's Day that we don't want to sidetrack
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.480]   and say, you know what?
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.520]   All the other time of the year, we're
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.240]   going to be celebrating Jesus.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.800]   But today, we're going to be celebrating Mom.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.720]   And I think that would be wrong.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440]   It would be unbiblical to say, you know what?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.960]   At least we need one day to reserve.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.160]   And Jesus, move aside.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.700]   We're going to be praising Mom today.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.840]   So we want to be careful that we're not doing that.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   In the context of celebrating and honoring our mothers,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.920]   that we recognize ultimately that in celebrating our moms,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.480]   that we are celebrating Christ.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.880]   And that can never be two separate things.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.080]   But if there was anybody in our lives, or say people groups,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   that is deserving of honor, I would say it would be mothers.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.560]   And I'm not just saying that to kiss up to all the moms today.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   And I think if we were to really think
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.200]   about one person in our lives who is a Christ figure,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.320]   it has to be our moms.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.000]   You talk about unconditional love.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.500]   I don't think human beings actually
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.960]   practice unconditional love.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.080]   Even moms, even dads, I don't think
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.880]   we ever fully practice unconditional love,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.800]   because we're selfless.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   We're all fallen creatures.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.480]   But if there was any person in our lives
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   that comes to closest unconditional love,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.920]   I would say it's moms.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.200]   Moms have to practice grace, because we're not deserving.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Especially, I mean, those of you who are parents,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.360]   you know when they're young kids,
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.920]   you send them off to be babysat by the uncle or some friend,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.480]   and then you let them watch video
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   till 11 o'clock at night and have fun for a couple days.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.580]   All of a sudden, they come back and say,
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.720]   I want that person to be my mom.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.080]   And it's like, oh my gosh, you don't know all the stuff
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.360]   that I've done for you, every sacrifice I've made.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.240]   But you give them enough candy, their loyalty
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.480]   can change just like that.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.560]   But you don't see any mom say, well, then go.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.640]   You want them, then go.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.520]   See what it's like.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.320]   We don't do that.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.440]   The moms don't do that.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   They can't do that, because obviously, without love,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.680]   without what we consider to be unconditional love,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.640]   our children would not live.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.760]   And in fact, all your life, you sacrifice for the children.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   At the end, if you've done a good job,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.000]   they'll pack up their bags and they'll leave.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.880]   They're not going to stay there and say, well,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.000]   you poured into me, now how can I pay you back?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.720]   All of us, once our parents have done their job,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   you pack up and say bye, and then you pour out
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   to somebody else.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.760]   And then you pour out to them, and then they're
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.220]   going to pour out to somebody else.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.760]   So if there's any job in this world that
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.600]   is as closest to what we can think of love of Christ,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   it would probably be our moms.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.880]   And it is a tough, tough job.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.040]   And again, I'm not saying this because it's Mother's Day.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.800]   I actually stayed home with my first son, Jeremy,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.240]   for a year and a half.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.320]   When we had Jeremy, Esther was working as a schoolteacher.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.240]   And I didn't have much income at that time.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.520]   I didn't have health insurance.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.200]   So she had to go to work because that was
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.560]   the only way for us to survive.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.200]   So a year and a half, I stayed home with Jeremy.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   And I could tell you that a year and a half probably
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.480]   should not have happened.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.280]   I was thinking in my mind that if I keep going down this path,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.000]   my kid's going to become a Neanderthal.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.280]   Because it's just not nurturing, that aspect.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.880]   I don't know.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.840]   Some of you guys are better than I am.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.760]   But when a kid falls down and he hurts,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.000]   immediately my thought is not, oh my gosh,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.560]   I need to go take care of this kid.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.960]   The immediate thought that I have
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.320]   is, is that bad enough for me to get up?
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   You know, like, is that--
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.560]   The world is hard.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.200]   If I come up and take care of him every time he falls,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.680]   he's going to become a sissy.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.920]   He's got to toughen up.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.720]   Those are the kind of thoughts that I have.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.400]   I've got to train him to be a soldier.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.320]   So I remember a year and a half that I was at home.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.160]   It was just so draining.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.080]   From the outside, you look at it, and it's like, whoa,
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.360]   they just wake up, make breakfast,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   and change their diaper.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.880]   And they can go out and play.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.520]   I mean, it looks pretty easy.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.680]   But taking care of a kid that's next to you, like, 24/7,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.040]   you can't take their eyes off, even for a minute.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.120]   You can't go to the bathroom.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.040]   I'm not kidding.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.160]   You can't go to the--
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.000]   you have to take your kid into the bathroom.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.240]   Because that one minute that you take your eyes off of them,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.920]   they could put their finger into the socket.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.320]   They could go into their diaper, put that in their mouth.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.640]   I mean, all kinds of stuff can happen during that one minute.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.320]   So even bathroom, you've got to take them into the bathroom
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.960]   and watch them.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.760]   So it is exhausting.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.360]   And I can imagine some of the parents who have twins,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.120]   what it's like.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.800]   It is a tough, tough job.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.920]   So I remember after the year and a half,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.280]   Esther would come home around 3, 3.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.120]   She'd try to come home as soon as possible,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.360]   and come home and relieve me.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.440]   But literally, around 3.30, me and Jeremy--
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.200]   I would have Jeremy in this little basket,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   and I would sit at the door.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.920]   She opened the door, boom.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.440]   All right, I'm out.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.280]   It is a tough, tough job.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.840]   And it is a thankless job at times.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.040]   So I think if there's any individual in our lives that
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   really deserves to be honored and to be celebrated,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.080]   it's our mom.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.960]   They need to be strengthened.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.000]   They need to know that even though they don't hear it
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.320]   every day, and day to day, they may feel like it's thankless,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.600]   that at least today, to let them know we appreciate them,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.280]   and that they may remember this.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.760]   All the more why this text is so strange.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.600]   After saying all of that, you're really going to say this?
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   Yes, she will be saved through childbearing.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.120]   This is a context where Paul is describing
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.280]   how to behave in the church, and the order that God has created.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.160]   And people can just easily read this and dismiss this,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.640]   and say, oh, this is ancient.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.080]   God didn't really intend this to be practiced.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.160]   How can you possibly think in this day and age
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.640]   that this is going to be relevant?
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.840]   Who would possibly read this and say this is from God?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.800]   But the problem is the rationale behind why he says this,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.400]   he goes all the way back to creation,
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.280]   that this was God's intention from the beginning.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.000]   If we understand this text, not understanding
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.720]   the redemptive history, the large picture behind this text,
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.440]   we can just see that and say, oh, this
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   is oppressive to women.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.680]   This is male chauvinism.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.040]   Why would anyone ever be attracted to this?
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.680]   And all the more why we need to understand the bigger picture.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   What is happening here?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.000]   Why is Paul saying this?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.320]   What does this have to do with the gospel?
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.040]   Clearly, when he says in this text in verse 15,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.760]   yes, she will be saved through childbearing,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.560]   the word saved here cannot mean salvation, justification.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.720]   Because obviously, Paul is not saying
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   that men are saved through faith because of the blood of Christ
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.640]   and that women are saved if they do a good job having children.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.560]   Just like in the English, when we say the word saved,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.720]   it means all kinds of stuff, like I save money
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.920]   to go on a trip.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.200]   Or somebody would say, oh, I saved a cat.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.740]   When somebody says they saved a cat,
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.120]   it doesn't mean that they got salvation.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.320]   It means that you saved them from danger.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.880]   You got them off a tree or something.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.400]   So in the same way in the Greek, the word for saved
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.560]   is not always referring to eternal life.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.360]   It's referring to eternal life in heaven.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.280]   In fact, in some texts, that same word here
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.960]   is used for deliverance, to make something whole,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.640]   to persevere, to make something safe from danger.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.920]   So clearly, he's not talking about justification here.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.800]   He's talking about preservation.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   He's talking about the ramification, maybe,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.680]   of salvation here.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.520]   But to really understand what's going on,
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.920]   we have to see the larger picture of why women were called
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   to the task and why it preserves them and makes them whole
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.840]   and saves them from danger.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   Turn your Bible all the way to Genesis 3.16,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.640]   because these verses are directly related.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.800]   So if you don't understand one, it'll
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.680]   be hard to swallow the other.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.560]   Genesis 3.16.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.800]   Now, you know what happens in Genesis 3.16.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.360]   God creates Adam and Eve.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.400]   God tells them to not eat of the tree of knowledge of good
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.200]   and evil.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.540]   If you do it, you shall surely die.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.640]   So prior to this, Eve gets tempted by Satan.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   And then Eve, after she eats of it, introduces it to Adam.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   And they both eat of it.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   And they fall from the grace of God.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.160]   And as soon as their eyes are open, they see their nakedness.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.240]   And they hide from each other.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.320]   And then God shows up.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.600]   And they are in fear.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   And then God begins to speak to them.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.240]   And prior to this verse, it's a description
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.200]   of the fall and the judgment on Satan.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.700]   And then after this, there will be
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.580]   a description of the judgment for the man.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.020]   And it's a longer description of that.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.380]   But in this text in 3.16, it's a specific description
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.900]   of the ramification of this fall to the women.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.380]   And he says this, verse 3--
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.900]   chapter 3.16.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.860]   "To the woman, he said, I will surely
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.100]   multiply your pain in childbearing.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.740]   And in pain, you shall bring forth children.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.220]   Your desire shall be for your husband.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.220]   And he shall rule over you."
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.040]   There are two words here that are used
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.520]   that are extremely important for us to understand.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   And again, connected to what's happening in 1 Timothy.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.120]   The two words are the word "pain" and "desire."
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.960]   And those are the ramifications of the fall.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.600]   The curse that came upon the woman was pain and desire.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.880]   Now, if you remember, the very reason
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.640]   why God created Eve in the first place
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   was God created Adam and said, you
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.280]   shall be fruitful and multiply.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.520]   And you will subdue the land.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   You're going to be the caretaker of my creation.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.880]   But as soon as the fall happens, what happens?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.640]   God's intention for Adam and Eve gets corrupted.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.680]   It is not destroyed.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.500]   It gets corrupted.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.280]   God created Eve for the purpose that she
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.680]   may be a suitable helper so that he can multiply.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.100]   So if you look at the curse here,
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.000]   the two reasons why Eve was created
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.840]   was to be a suitable helper and so that she may multiply.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.680]   So if you look at the curse, there's
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.560]   two things that get corrupted-- her relationship
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.920]   with her husband and the process of multiplying.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.440]   In other words, you will continue to multiply,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.400]   but you will do it in much pain.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   And second, your relationship with your husband
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.120]   is going to be strained.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.080]   So these two words describe the curse
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.840]   that comes upon the woman-- the fruitfulness and desire.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.760]   Now today, our point is not to get into the word "desire"
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.680]   because we're not going to get into the corruption that
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   came into husband and wife.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.320]   Maybe in the future days, we'll talk about that.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.420]   But I want to focus on the word "pain"
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.240]   because it is directly related to what we're talking about.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.160]   If you notice in verse 16 that there are two words--
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.280]   the word "pain" is used twice.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.120]   "I will surely multiply your pain and childbearing"--
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   first time-- "and then in pain you
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.560]   shall bring forth children"-- the second time.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.840]   Well, if you look at the Hebrew text,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   the two words are not the same.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.440]   In English, it's translated both "pain."
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.920]   But the first word for pain is "hesabon."
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.440]   And it is not referring to physical pain.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.320]   In fact, the better translation for that
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.080]   may be "anxiety" or "concern" or "worry."
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.580]   It's not referring to physical pain.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.160]   The second word is "heseb," and that's
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.440]   the word for physical pain.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.120]   So when he says, "I will surely multiply your pain,"
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.600]   he's saying, "I will multiply your anxiety, concern."
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.800]   There will be sorrow in childbearing,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.120]   and then in pain-- physical pain--
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.240]   "you shall bring forth children."
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.720]   Again, to properly understand the curse that
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.280]   came upon the woman, first we know
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.680]   that he's not just referring to physical pain.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.900]   He's talking about the sorrow, the anxiety, that's
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.000]   going to come in childbearing.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.760]   But the very word "childbearing" in and of itself
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.360]   is not referring to giving birth.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.520]   That same word is to describe when a father becomes
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.400]   a father of a child.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.480]   It's not talking about the delivery itself.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.120]   It's talking about the father becoming a father.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.960]   That same word is used to describe Moses
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.440]   as the father of Israel.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.320]   That out of Moses came the nation of Israel.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.000]   So when you put all of that together,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.640]   the curse that comes upon the mom isn't just the pain.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.440]   Obviously, typically when the woman goes into labor
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.960]   and they experience pain, we say, oh, it's because of Eve.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.560]   Eve did it.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.840]   And if it wasn't for Eve, the giving birth
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.000]   would be so easy-- maybe.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.640]   But he's not just talking-- it's not
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.160]   limited to the physical pain.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.040]   Understanding all of it, the curse
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.240]   is the whole process of motherhood
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.320]   is going to be sorrowful, painful, and difficult.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.960]   Now again, those of you who are mothers now,
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.720]   and you're trying to make the best of it,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.220]   but you already know probably the toughest job you've ever
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.360]   had in your life is after you became a mom.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.760]   A lot of times people ask, what's
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.560]   the best way to prepare for motherhood?
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.080]   Sit down and make a bucket list of all the things
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.600]   that you would desire in your life, and then burn it.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.880]   That's the best way to prepare for motherhood.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Basically, what motherhood is, you had your life,
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.000]   and then now you're going to pour it out to somebody else.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.520]   Now you might-- man, that's just a negative way
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.960]   to describe motherhood.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   Ask any mom if that's not a good description.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.040]   But God gives us grace.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.720]   And I can tell you that probably no mother in this room
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   would trade what they're doing, though.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.180]   As difficult, and as hard, and as sacrificial
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.240]   as it may be, the rewards of loving your child
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   is the greatest gift, greatest thing that we have,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.120]   as difficult as it is.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.400]   But it is a good description, because the scripture says
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.600]   the whole process of becoming a mother, raising children,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.360]   is going to be painful and difficult.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.320]   And the main reason why is because you're
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.640]   going to be bearing fruit to sinners.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.920]   You're bearing fruit to sinners.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.400]   And you know, in life, if you have somebody who's selfish,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.040]   and they say crass things, and they do things,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.400]   and you say, you know what?
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.520]   We'll just become acquaintances, but we
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.080]   don't need to be good friends.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.580]   So even in a church like this, we
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.000]   have certain people that we're close to
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.580]   and certain people we're not close to.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.040]   And we kind of do that, and we justify it.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   We just keep our distance from certain people,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.540]   and good friends with certain people.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.880]   You can't do that with your kids.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.080]   No matter what it is, no matter how selfish they may behave,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.320]   you can't do that.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.240]   Not because they deserve it, but because without you,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.960]   they can't survive.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   It is difficult, because now you are directly
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.400]   connected to another sinner.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.200]   And the more they age, the more that sin
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.240]   is going to be prevalent.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.000]   See, the whole thing about being fruitful and multiply
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.120]   has become tainted.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.720]   We are still bearing fruit in some way.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.880]   We're still multiplying in some way.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.840]   But it says the curse that has come upon mankind
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   has made it difficult.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.880]   In fact, if you look at the book of Genesis,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.440]   the history of Israel, the history of Israel
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.200]   and history of mankind is the overflow of this curse
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.800]   and how it affected nations, how it affected families,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.640]   how it affected kings, how it affected prophets,
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.480]   how it affected religion.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.160]   The whole history of mankind is how this curse
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.520]   is being played out.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.440]   Right off the bat, as soon as Adam and Eve has children,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.600]   they multiply.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.640]   Well, what happened?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   You guys know.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.360]   The first kid they have is Cain.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.760]   Second one is Abel.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.600]   I can't think of anything more excruciatingly painful
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.160]   than to have parents watch their child die,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.120]   to experience that.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.360]   If you read the account of Cain and Abel,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.240]   obviously, something horrendous happens.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.200]   The fall happens.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.660]   And then the immediate ramification
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.920]   is Cain is jealous over Abel.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.440]   And Cain actually ends up murdering Abel.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.520]   There is no story behind where you would,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.280]   where there's, Adam and Eve,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.520]   you don't hear anything about it.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.720]   There's no mention of them.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.400]   They don't bury Abel.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.720]   There's nothing.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   But we can imagine.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.800]   Not only did they lose their second child,
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.040]   but they lost him in the hands of the first child.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.000]   There is no justice that can be carried out
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.440]   that's going to compensate for their loss and their pain.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.320]   So can you imagine this pain?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.000]   But there's silence.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.760]   We see the same picture in Leviticus chapter 10,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.800]   a similar picture where, you know, Aaron,
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.080]   he makes a huge blunder.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.840]   And he's the one who creates the golden calf.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.080]   And as a result of that, judgment comes upon a nation.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.360]   And they get judged.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.240]   And then later on in Leviticus 10,
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.520]   God establishes the sacrificial system.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.360]   And the first priest that comes to sacrifice
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.520]   are his two sons, Nadab and Abihu.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.000]   They sacrifice a strange fire.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.800]   And as a result of that, God comes and consumes both of them.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.760]   And they die.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.480]   And you know what it says right after in chapter 10, verse 3?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.080]   He said, Aaron held his peace.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.000]   That's all it says.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.480]   It doesn't talk about how Aaron pleaded with God,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.640]   like how could you do this?
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.480]   He said, he just stood there and just took it.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.560]   And he knew because he made the same mistake.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.280]   See, this is the curse upon man.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.720]   Everything that-- all the ramifications
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.760]   of a sinful world that you and I have experienced,
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.400]   our children will also experience.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.040]   See, but that's the whole gospel.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.280]   And this is where the hope comes in.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.040]   In Genesis 3, 13, it says, Christ
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.580]   redeemed us from the curse of the law
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.520]   by becoming a curse for us.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.040]   For it is written, cursed is everyone
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.560]   who is hanged on a tree, every single one of us.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.000]   We were born into this curse.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.600]   Every man was born into this curse.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.560]   Every woman was born into this curse.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.080]   Every child, no matter how cute and precious they are,
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.040]   were born into this curse.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.840]   But the scripture says that Christ redeemed us.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.400]   And he absorbed this curse upon himself
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.720]   that this curse may be reversed.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.280]   That's why every time we have a wedding ceremony,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.800]   the whole wedding ceremony, this whole drama--
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.160]   and it is drama.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.000]   All the money and time and everybody flying over
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.880]   from everywhere to participate in this wedding, right?
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.960]   In fact, I've seen some of the biggest fights in couples
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.120]   happen because of this wedding.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.840]   And I know some of you, you kept your peace
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.380]   until you went to your honeymoon.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.680]   And then you came back, and like, why you?
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.800]   And that was the beginning of your wedding, your marriage.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.480]   I mean, it is drama.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.040]   But the whole purpose of the drama
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.600]   is to physically illustrate redemption of mankind.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.520]   See, the woman doesn't come down the aisle
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.680]   because she lived a perfect, pure life.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.760]   The scripture says in Ephesians 5
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.320]   that Christ redeemed her and made her white by his blood.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.920]   She represents the church.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   The groom represents Jesus.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.560]   And then the two parties represent the covenant
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.240]   relationship with God.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.360]   And all of it is to illustrate that now this curse
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.640]   is being reversed in this marriage.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.280]   Well, this curse is reversed in the home in particular.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.920]   This is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.400]   When we're talking about living up
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.280]   to the gospel of Jesus Christ, where this redemption is played
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   out, first and foremost, it's between a husband and wife.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.840]   And then secondly, it happens with the parents
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.560]   and their children, in particular, the mom
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.840]   and their kids.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.640]   This is where the rubber meets the road.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.840]   Our revelation of our redemption doesn't always show here.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.000]   Because you're only here for an hour and a half,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.800]   two hours at most, right?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.640]   If you hang out, if you're really religious,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.160]   you'll be here for three hours, four hours, right?
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.600]   And then during the week, you're there another two, three hours.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   You put it all together, you're talking about five,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.200]   six hours a week that you've got to put on your best face.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.920]   Don't curse.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.200]   Don't get drunk.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.880]   At least during those five hours, just come.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.920]   And then don't be a jerk.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.280]   So you can put on the best face for about five hours
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.240]   of the week.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.440]   But who we really are is what we are the rest of the time.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.940]   It's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.840]   We can put on a good face outside of our home,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.160]   especially at church.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.520]   But at home, who are we?
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.040]   In particular, in our relationship
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.400]   with our children, mother and child,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.920]   that's where the gospel must first be preached.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.720]   It must first be practiced.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.480]   It is a grave mistake for us to think
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.680]   that if we protect our children from other bad kids,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.160]   that our kids will be fine.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.240]   Typically, that's what happens when you have a kid
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.960]   and you try so hard to protect them.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.320]   And you don't use foul language.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.360]   You don't watch bad stuff.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.400]   And they're so good.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.640]   And all of a sudden, you start taking them to preschool.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.360]   And they come back.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   And they got this language.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.520]   They're saying all of this stuff.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.920]   And all of a sudden, they don't want to share their toys.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.640]   And the first thought that a parent has
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.560]   is, who did this to my kid?
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   And then you start looking at the preschoolers,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.840]   like, that kid's so selfish.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.120]   He's learning from that kid.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   And they go to school.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.520]   And they start saying things that they didn't say before.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.520]   It's like, oh, he's being corrupted by that kid.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.240]   We've got to keep him away from him.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.520]   We've got to keep him away from her.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.720]   And then we want to live in a place
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.680]   where we're going to feel safe.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.840]   And it is a grave mistake for us to think
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.320]   that we can weed out sin in a child's life
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.480]   if we protect them from all the corruption.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.280]   But here's a mistake.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.040]   Scripture clearly says, Jesus said,
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.920]   it is not what comes out of-- it is not
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.080]   what you put into a child that corrupts him.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.760]   Obviously, it says a man.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.960]   But a child is no different.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.080]   It is not what you put into a child,
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.540]   but it's what comes out of a child.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.040]   In other words, what is he saying?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.480]   He says it's in him.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.280]   Sin is not in him.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.480]   It's not you walking around.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.440]   You stepped on sin.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.200]   Or you went to the wrong neighborhood.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.240]   You got exposed to the wrong kids.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.600]   He says, no, that corruption is in that child.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.840]   See, the whole point of the gospel, first and foremost,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.960]   is when we recognize we are sinners,
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.840]   and it's no different with our children.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.720]   If we think that our children are angels,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.000]   and they're born good, and if we just keep them good,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.160]   if we don't expose them to sin, that's
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.280]   going to somehow become these good citizens who
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.360]   are going to love Jesus.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.760]   It is a grave mistake.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.000]   Just as you and I met Christ when
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.800]   we recognize our sin, as parents,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.920]   we need to first and foremost recognize
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.000]   that they were born with a corrupt nature like us.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.720]   It is a mistake for us to think that if we parent them,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.000]   if we somehow show them good behavior, teach them early,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.520]   get them advanced, if we don't watch certain programs,
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.560]   and if we allow them to do certain things
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.280]   and advance them in their language,
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.680]   and somehow all of these things are going to make them great,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.440]   they may read better than other children,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.480]   they may be more athletic than other children,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.040]   they may have better behavior, they may be unselfish,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.640]   but in the end, at the core, it does nothing
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.680]   for their salvation.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.040]   First and foremost, we must recognize that this curse
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.960]   is upon all of us.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.760]   In particular, we need to recognize this at home.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.880]   Whenever we have somebody who does something horrendous,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.000]   like Ted Bundy, I mean, that's from my generation.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.480]   That was the most immediate thing I can think of.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   He just murdered dozens of females
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.680]   just because he was sexually tempted.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.440]   And then at his death sentence, before they killed him,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.840]   the capital punishment, they did an interview,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.040]   and they went back, and they're trying to comb through his life
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.440]   of what happened to this guy.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.360]   How can our society have created such a monster?
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.160]   I went back and talked to the parents,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.600]   and found out they were normal people.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.920]   They're very nominal Christians who attended church,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.560]   who was raised in Sunday school.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.920]   He was a very articulate man, studied law.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   And yet, they couldn't figure out.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.440]   So, it was just an enigma.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.760]   Like, he didn't fit a mass murderer.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.240]   He didn't have strange tattoos.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.800]   He wasn't saying strange things.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.200]   He was very articulate.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.440]   If you met him out on the street,
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.200]   you would think he'd be a professor of a school
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.080]   or something.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.600]   See, but what our society doesn't understand
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.000]   is that this corruption inside of all of us,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.200]   you can't weed out sin with good behavior.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.640]   You can't weed out sin simply by good example.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   You can't weed out sin by memorizing certain scripture.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.520]   You're not going to weed out sin by advancing them
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.720]   and living in a certain neighborhood.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.680]   First and foremost, what does this teach us,
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.600]   and how does this relate to what we're talking about
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.920]   in 1 Timothy?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.560]   We must first and foremost be the evangelist to our children.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.440]   First and foremost.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.920]   We can live all our lives protecting them,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.040]   providing for them, spending all our time vacationing,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.560]   providing the nicest house.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   But in the end, if they did not know Christ,
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.560]   what is it for?
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.400]   When Jesus says, "What is a profit
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.800]   "if you gain the whole world and forfeit your soul?"
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.160]   What benefit is it?
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.240]   That they lived in a nice home, parents loved each other,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.520]   went to church, served the church, had Sunday school,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.280]   and yet they do not know Christ.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.360]   See, Paul says to Timothy, 2 Timothy 1.5,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.400]   "I am reminded of your sincere faith,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.800]   "a faith that dwelled first in your grandmother Lois
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.440]   "and your mother Eunice, and now, I am sure,
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.320]   "dwells in you as well."
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.480]   He didn't just talk about Timothy.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.080]   He said, "Timothy, don't forget that your faith
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   "was because God was faithful to your grandmother
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.160]   "and then to your mother, and now you."
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.440]   And that's why he reminds him in 2 Timothy again
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.760]   to persevere in his faith.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.600]   2 Timothy 3.14, "But I ask for you, continue
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.280]   "in what you have learned and have firmly believed,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.560]   "knowing from whom you learned it
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.760]   "and how from childhood you have been acquainted
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.200]   "with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.520]   "for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.960]   There is nothing more important for the work of a mother
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.920]   and a father than to be the first evangelist
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.760]   to our children.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.880]   You know, we typically think of like, you know,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.840]   the people, the testimonies we wanna hear
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.680]   are people who used to be ex-gangsters,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.560]   or, you know, they came in and out of prison,
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.520]   got all these tattoos, "I murdered somebody,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.840]   "and Jesus saved me."
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.880]   It's like, "Oh my gosh," you know?
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.120]   It's so glorious, God changed you.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.680]   But whenever we hear of testimonies,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.160]   it's like, "Yeah, my mom shared the gospel with me,
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.640]   "and at five, I accepted, and I got baptized when I was six."
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.480]   Right?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.840]   And then, you know, our typical response is,
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.480]   "Oh, okay, okay, thank you for your testimony.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.360]   "So encouraging, next."
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.720]   Right?
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.680]   But the longer I live, the more I experience
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.160]   just what a tremendous blessing that is,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.960]   and how rare that really is.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.800]   You know, everybody talks about how,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.680]   "Zach, you know, I strayed, I didn't know God,
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.640]   "and later on, I went to campus ministry,"
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.400]   and all this, but every once in a while,
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.920]   I hear somebody saying, "My mom shared the gospel with me.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.760]   "My dad, it was my home, and they were an example to me,
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.120]   "and I became a Christian, and I've been walking
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.160]   "with the Lord since I was six, or seven, or eight, or nine."
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.080]   What a tremendous blessing that is,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.480]   that for every parent, our first and foremost priority,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.640]   before we think about, like,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.280]   "What am I gonna do for God in China?
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.200]   "What am I gonna do for God in India?"
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.080]   That we need to become evangelists,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.900]   and to be a faithful evangelist,
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.640]   we need to first recognize that we are dealing with sinners,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   not out there.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   So when they're selfish, when they're self-centered,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.520]   it's because they're sinners.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.560]   And just like a church, when people come with sin,
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.420]   said, "That's why you're here,
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.000]   "'cause that's why we're preaching the gospel,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.220]   "so that you would recognize
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.760]   "the only cure for sin is Christ."
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.320]   So first and foremost, we are called to our children
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.360]   to be evangelists.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.640]   Second, do not make a mistake
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.080]   of making our children our idols.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.960]   Luke chapter 14, 26 to 27, and another verse
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.480]   that is appropriate for Mother's Day.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.640]   "and mother, and wife, and children,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.880]   "and brother, and sister, yes,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.200]   "and even his own life, cannot be my disciple."
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   That's another great verse to look at for Mother's Day.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.680]   It says, "Not to honor, but to hate your father,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.920]   "hate your mother."
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.560]   So if we stop the sermon here,
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.920]   and go home and say, "What'd you learn today?"
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.760]   It's like, "Well, it says to hate you."
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.520]   (audience laughs)
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.800]   That's what we read, it's biblical.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.120]   But you need to understand this, again,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.720]   in the context of the larger message that Jesus was giving.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.280]   Right after this is when Jesus says,
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   "If you do not pick up your cross and deny yourself,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.000]   "you cannot be my disciple."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.840]   He's not simply talking about how a Christian should live.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.480]   He's talking about salvation.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.800]   When he's talking about, "Be my disciple,"
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.080]   he's not talking about, "Here's a level one disciple
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.340]   "who comes to Christ, and the level two disciple
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.000]   "doesn't come to Christ.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.600]   "Here's this level one disciple who picks up the cross,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.720]   "and here's this other disciple
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.000]   "who chooses not to pick up the cross."
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.160]   He says, "No, anyone who comes after me
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   "must pick up his cross.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.880]   "You cannot be my disciple if you do not hate your father,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.120]   "mother, or children."
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.960]   What does he mean by that?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.160]   And again, when you look at it superficially,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.760]   you know, like, he's the one who tells us
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.640]   to honor our father and mother.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.920]   And now he says, "Hey, it seems like a contradiction,"
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.400]   but in reality, that's not what he's saying at all.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.520]   Obviously, he's not saying that.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.800]   What he is saying in this text, in the context,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.640]   is kind of, and I shared this with Bible study one time,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.680]   it's kind of like, you know, when you get on an airline,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.840]   they tell you when you're in trouble and you need oxygen,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.160]   that oxygen mask comes down, what do they tell you to do?
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   First, if you were traveling with a child,
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.040]   put it on yourself, right?
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.760]   And why do they tell you to do that?
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.120]   Because you shouldn't care about your kids, right?
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.960]   That's why they're telling you,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.760]   because all the airlines hate children, right?
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.440]   And so they want you to hate your kids, too.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.200]   That's why they're doing it, right?
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.080]   So superficially, you can read this verse,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.800]   like, is that what Jesus is saying?
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.440]   Obviously, that's not what Jesus is saying.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.960]   Why they tell you to put it on?
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.240]   Because until you breathe, until you're okay,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.400]   you can't help your kid.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   So if you don't help yourself, not only is she gonna die,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.000]   you're gonna die, and there's nobody to help anybody.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.840]   What is Jesus saying here?
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.420]   Anything that prevents you from coming to Christ
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.680]   is going to lead to death.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.720]   Anything, even father or mother, even children.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.040]   If you make them your greatest priority in life,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.880]   not only will you die, but so will they.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.960]   The only way of salvation is Christ.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.920]   He said, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.400]   "Nobody comes to the Father but through me."
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.760]   You know, we don't come to Jesus and get saved,
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.200]   and then they don't get saved because they come to us.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.880]   It is not our love that saves them.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   It is not our good example
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.640]   that will cause them to go to heaven.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.760]   It is not our protection.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.560]   It is not our neighborhood.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.160]   It is not a great marriage between husband and wife
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.200]   that's going to save them.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.740]   Salvation is found in one person,
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.380]   one person only, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.820]   So when Jesus says this, he's saying,
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.380]   "No, whatever prevents you from coming to me
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.120]   "will result in death."
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.240]   So it is a grave mistake to think
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.080]   that somehow if we provide the best,
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.300]   if we have the best marriage,
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.920]   if we give them the best gift,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.580]   if we give them the best house,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.980]   that somehow they're gonna be better off
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.060]   than everybody else.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.580]   What is a prophet?
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.260]   If you give them the whole world,
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.940]   and yet they forfeit their soul.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.080]   And that's why he's saying, first and foremost,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.200]   we need to be evangelists.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.320]   But to be an evangelist, we need to recognize
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.120]   that the greatest gift that we can give them is Christ.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.000]   Sometimes the good gift that we give them
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.440]   ends up becoming an obstacle to Christ,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.700]   because they depend so much on your protection,
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.220]   they depend so much on your love and your gift,
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.220]   that they may grow up thinking that they don't need Christ.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.300]   And the third and final thing,
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.580]   that we need to be the first evangelist at home,
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.700]   secondly, that we don't make them our idols,
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.740]   that Christ is first in everything.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.880]   Third and finally, if we're not careful,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   we can inoculate them with the gospel,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.580]   that when they grow up, the gospel has no effect on them.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.440]   See, the two greatest commandments in the scripture
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.780]   is love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.040]   soul, mind, and strength.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.840]   See, the point of what Jesus is saying
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.540]   is not simply love the Lord
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.120]   with your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.820]   His point is with all your heart,
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.560]   with all your soul, with all your mind,
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.960]   with all your strength, all of it.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.080]   He's not simply talking about what's the strength,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.360]   what's the heart, what's the mind.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.800]   We get into all of that, but really,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.200]   one point that he's making with everything,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.220]   everything that you have, right?
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.980]   Just like Paul said, if you're gonna run this race,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.300]   run to win.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.220]   Some of the people who are the hardest
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.020]   to share the gospel with are people
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.720]   who grew up in nominal Christian homes.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.220]   You can go on Google and you can type in and see
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.900]   how many people who are antagonists to the faith
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.620]   grew up in church-going homes.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.220]   Joseph Stalin grew up in a nominal Christian home,
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.740]   went to church all his life.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.960]   In fact, he started in his early education
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.100]   in a theological school.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.360]   Charles Darwin grew up in a very nominal Christian home.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.680]   His dad was a very successful businessman
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.400]   going from town to town, never missed Sunday school,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.220]   memorized gospel scripture.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.000]   In fact, when he first went into school,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.740]   he went in to become a priest of an Anglican church.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.720]   But they turned away from God
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.940]   because they grew up in a very nominal Christian home.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.920]   They memorized scripture.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.420]   They may have prayed before meals.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.260]   And they lived in a home.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.660]   They had a form of godliness, but there was no power.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.020]   It was just surface.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.060]   It was just religiousness.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.620]   They just went through the motion, but it wasn't real.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.860]   See, for first-generation Christians,
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.540]   when we become dry and difficult,
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.780]   we always have our past.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.480]   I remember when I was back in college,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.900]   when I was younger, when I used to be,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.820]   and that kind of anchors us.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.660]   And even at times when we want to drift away,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.180]   that anchors us so that we don't shift from that.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.940]   But second-generation Christians
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.900]   who grow up in nominal Christian homes,
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.940]   they don't have anything to anchor.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.780]   All they know is what they see at home.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.420]   So when they begin to drift, there's nothing to hold them
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.460]   because the only thing they knew was nominal Christianity.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.980]   So when they begin to drift,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.480]   their memory of Christianity is go to church,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.700]   memorize scripture, don't curse,
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.700]   serve the church, pay tithe, don't say bad things,
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.620]   do good things, be a good citizen,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.580]   go to Sunday school, participate in VPS.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.480]   So some of the greatest memory they have is in the church,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.380]   but they don't have a personal relationship
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.480]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.580]   We can work so hard
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.400]   to kind of get the gospel into the kids.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.720]   And if we're not careful,
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.220]   all we are doing is inoculating them with the gospel
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.540]   so they become numb.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.420]   And so when they hear the gospel,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.860]   it's like, "I've heard it a thousand times.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.660]   "I've heard it when I was three, I heard it when I was 10.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.420]   "I've been to VPS, I never miss Sunday.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.300]   "I know all of that."
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.620]   So there's nothing that can be said
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.660]   that they have not heard before.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.020]   And all they've done is kind of like during flu season,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.660]   we get shots and we get just enough bacteria inside of us
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.460]   so that it builds an immune system
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.920]   so when the real flu comes, they're inoculated.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:46.160]   If we follow Christ nominally at a distance,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.280]   going through religious motion,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.400]   the very first place where you will see a fruit of that
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.240]   is with your children.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.680]   Not maybe when three, not five,
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.480]   but when they get older, you will see
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.200]   that they're not anchored in Christ.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.260]   Always learning, but never ever able to come to the truth.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.140]   As I said, and I said this before,
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.820]   some of the hardest people to share the gospel with
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.060]   are former missionary kids and former pastor's kids.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.940]   They grew up all their life around this religiousness
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.460]   and they're just so numb
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.140]   until something tragic happens and then they wake up from it
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.540]   and it would be the greatest tragedy in a Christian home
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.480]   to raise children with all kinds of religious things
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.780]   around this and yet not know Christ.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.840]   See, that's a challenge to each one of us
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.720]   'cause I know ultimately, no matter what I say,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.640]   no matter how many worship services and scripture we read,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.280]   that my children are gonna watch me
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.000]   and they're gonna know who Christ is
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.400]   through what they see in me.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.080]   I shared this before, this last weekend,
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.280]   Esther went up north to be an encouragement
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   to the Troy family and I'm the one always leaving.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   So in the last 18 plus years,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.220]   I've been away from home sometimes a week or four weeks
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.080]   or for long periods of time.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   So when I leave, it doesn't skip a beat.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.840]   It's like, oh, dad's going,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.920]   just make sure you bring something back.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.340]   And that's usually the amount of preparation
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.620]   that goes into me leaving.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.080]   But when Esther leaves, it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.540]   we're gonna eat, we're gonna starve to death.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.920]   So Esther's out, she's cooking
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.400]   and she got all these things prepared
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   and it was so encouraging 'cause after she left,
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.360]   and it's like, my thinking is,
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.840]   why don't we just go to McDonald's?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.480]   If we don't know what to eat, we're going to McDonald's.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.000]   That's what she was concerned about,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.580]   that we're gonna end up eating McDonald's for four days,
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.880]   which is most likely what would have happened.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.940]   Well, I mean, so I didn't know.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.080]   So she was instructing Faith in the background saying,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.160]   hey, make sure you guys do this.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.960]   These boys are completely helpless without you.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.540]   So you're gonna have to get up.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.620]   And so Faith woke up in the morning
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.760]   and she was cooking breakfast.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.520]   And what was so interesting to me was,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.480]   like, Faith probably didn't even know, you know,
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.040]   but everything that she was doing was just mimicking Esther.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.700]   She may not have even done it consciously,
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.680]   but what does it mean to be a good wife?
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.660]   She learned from Esther.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.280]   So she would wake up early in the morning, you know,
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.680]   and she would make sure to have the coffee ready.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.420]   And I remember one particular morning,
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.800]   she gave me the coffee and she asked me,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.360]   Daddy, is there enough cream?
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.400]   You know, and then so I was drinking,
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.360]   oh, that's good, good, thanks, Faith.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.400]   And I just thought it was the cutest thing
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   because, you know, that's what Esther says,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.000]   asked me after she gives me coffee.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.200]   She's like, oh, is there enough cream?
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.760]   So yeah, I got enough cream.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.960]   And it was nothing,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.400]   but I bet you Faith did that just subconsciously
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   because that's what she observed.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.360]   That's how she knows, that's how she was trained, right?
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.160]   No matter what we say, no matter what we sit down and say,
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.980]   this is who God is, this is what the scripture says,
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.200]   in the end, they're gonna mimic us.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.060]   And so the best gift that we can give our children,
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.360]   love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.480]   soul, mind, and strength,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.840]   If you become a lover of God,
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.320]   your children will be the first to benefit.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.920]   You can't switch that off.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.400]   You can't be a nominal person and then say,
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.120]   I hope my children will be better than me.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.300]   The greatest gift that I can give to my children
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.720]   is to be the best example
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.920]   of what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.640]   So I pray on this Mother's Day, again, like I said,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.120]   I don't think there's a single group of people
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.520]   that is more deserving of encouragement and honor,
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.560]   humanly speaking, than mothers.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.960]   And so I thank God that God gave me that year and a half
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.860]   with Jeremy so that the rest of my life,
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.040]   I can say, thank you.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.800]   Thank you, all the moms for taking care of us.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.240]   Thank you, my mom in particular,
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.000]   because I get to say that 'cause I'm a peer,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   you know, and when I was younger, I did not appreciate,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.600]   you know, I was a typical rebellious teenager.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.960]   You know, all I understood was what I wasn't getting,
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.280]   and I didn't understand at all the sacrifice
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.000]   that went into raising a kid like me, you know.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.880]   And so for the rest of my life, I'm thankful.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.000]   I'm thankful for Esther.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.880]   I'm thankful for every single mom in here,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.800]   and I know the struggle that you go through
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.160]   and sometimes feeling unappreciated
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.040]   and the difficulties that you go through,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.120]   but, you know, your labor doesn't just affect you
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.200]   and your children, it affects the next generation.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.240]   You know, and so as our church is going
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.300]   through the next stage of our lives,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.640]   even though we've been around for 18 years,
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.760]   you know, only recently we're starting to think like,
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.720]   you know, all these kids,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.000]   like what are we gonna do about our buildings,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.640]   Sunday school, you know, teaching, what are we gonna do?
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.680]   As we think about how is our church,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.300]   what is our church gonna look like in the next 10 years
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.280]   when our little ones are in high school
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.760]   and they go to college?
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.200]   And then our college students become leaders in our church.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.680]   Like what is our church gonna look like at that time?
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.560]   And so as we think upon and as we begin to plan
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.280]   and implement certain things
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.680]   that we're not just thinking about today, right?
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.720]   How is my behavior, how is my worship,
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.400]   how is my love and my sacrifice gonna affect
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.280]   how this church is gonna look like in the next 20 years?
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.860]   And for that end, we wanna encourage all the moms, right,
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.700]   to persevere in what you're doing.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.100]   Your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:21.940]   Let's pray.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:27.380]   And as a praise team comes up,
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.500]   we're gonna give you some time to think carefully,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.980]   to pray deliberately for all the fathers,
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.300]   to pray for your wives especially,
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.180]   that God will strengthen them.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.940]   And all the children, pray for your moms in particular.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.400]   And don't forget to thank them today
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.440]   for their labor in your lives.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.400]   And to pray, and even the ones who don't have children.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.800]   You don't have to be,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.900]   have a physical child to be a good mother.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.480]   Be a mother to every child, everybody younger than you,
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.600]   that we may be responsible collectively as a church
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.480]   for the next generation.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.840]   So let's take some time to pray
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.920]   and ask the Lord to strengthen us in this way
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.320]   as our praise team leads us.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
