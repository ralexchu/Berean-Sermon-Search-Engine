[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Jesus, your mercy is almighty.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.480]   I have no defense.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480]   My guilt runs too deep.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.960]   The best of my works pierced your hands and your feet.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:22.440]   I know that my Redeemer lives.

[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   Worthy.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   Worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   We live for you.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   Oh, we live for you, Jesus.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.280]   Jesus, the name above every other name.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.280]   Jesus, the only one who could ever save.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   We live for you.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.760]   Oh, we live for you.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.240]   And holy, there is no one like you.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.720]   There is none beside you.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.200]   and lead me in love to the holy.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Oh, holy, there is no one like you.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   There is none beside you.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   Open up my eyes in wonder.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.680]   and lead me in love to the holy.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.180]   Good evening.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.560]   As you guys come in, we still have about a minute or two
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.240]   before our praise and prayer will begin.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.880]   But per other times that we have had praise and prayer,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.240]   the first couple rows are going to be removed halfway
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.280]   into the praise and prayer evening
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   so that we can kneel, be expressive in prayer.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   So if you want to take a moment to move forward,
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   you can do that now.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   Again, we have about a minute or two before we begin,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   so we'll start shortly.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   Surround me.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   Lead me in your love.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:28.280]   Lead me in your love.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   And I will build my life upon your love.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   It is a firm foundation.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   I will put my trust in you alone.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   And I will not be shaken.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   I will build my life upon your love.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   It is a firm foundation.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   I will put my trust in you alone.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   And I will not be shaken.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.280]   There is none beside you.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   Open up my eyes in wonder and show me who you are.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   And fill me with your heart and lead me in your love.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   You are holy, holy, holy.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   Holy, there is no one like you.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   There is none beside you.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Open up my eyes in wonder and show me who you are.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   And fill me with your heart and lead me in your love.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   I will build my life.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   And I will build my life upon your love.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   It is a firm foundation.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   And I will put my trust in you alone.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   And I will not be shaken.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   All my life for you, Lord.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   All my days for you, Lord.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   You can have it all.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.280]   You can have it all.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   You can have it all.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   Good to gather together as the first praise and prayer of 2024.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   So as we begin our worship here, we're going to sing together for you,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   our holy, as we approach our holy, holy God.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   (Music)
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   Sing together, oh God.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   Oh God, there's none like you in all the earth.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   In all the earth.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   Oh God, who can compare to you, to you.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   Only you have no beginning.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   Only you can make the skies.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   Only you are truth unending.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   Only you are always wise.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   Lord, there is none like you.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   For you are holy.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   You are holy.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   For you are holy.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   Lord, you are holy.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   Oh God.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   Oh God, there's none like you in all the earth.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   In all the earth.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:30.280]   Oh God, who can compare to you, to you.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   Only you are never sinning.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   Only you have never lied.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Only you cannot be tempted.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   Only you can never doubt.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   Lord, there is none like you.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   For you are holy.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   You are holy.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   You are holy.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   Lord, you are holy.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   For you are holy.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   For you are holy.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   For you are holy.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   Lord, you are holy.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   Okay, good evening again and I want to welcome you guys to Praise and Prayer.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   What an encouragement to join together in corporate prayer.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   And just by way of mentioning again that just like in previous occasions,
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   we are going to be removing the white chairs at the front.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   So if you want to take a moment right now to move forward into those chairs, you can do that.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   But also just as an encouragement to you, I know sometimes actually in service or what not,
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   our congregation generally is a little bit expressionless.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   But as an encouragement, you can be expressing your adoration, love for God both verbally and non-verbally as well.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   Don't be afraid to raise your hands.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Don't be afraid to express your love for God and your praises as you sing.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   And so we're going to dim the lights so that you can be encouraged to do so, okay?
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   Well, let's take a moment to pray as we go continue in worship.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   Heavenly Father, we recognize, God, that it is truly, truly your grace that we can approach you.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   With prayers, Lord, to express to you our love, express to you our gratitude and more.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   And Father, God, we recognize that in some sense, in reality, this is the scariest thing to do.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   But also, Lord God, just also indicative of pure faith that we can exercise.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.280]   Where we're lifting to you our thoughts and our words, believing that you from above hear.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   We believe, God, that your presence is everywhere with us.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   We believe, God, that you are sovereign.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   And Lord, whatever is impossible with man, Lord God, you have said we need to pray.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.280]   Because, Lord, it is possible with you.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   We ask, God, that in your mercy you would hear us tonight.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   And what's more, the gathering of the church and our heart and our worship and our song may be pleasing in your sight.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   Church family, let's stand together as we worship our God.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.280]   Again, if you need to make some room, you can.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   But again, as Pastor Mark mentioned, that we are able to maybe feel more comfortable in a darkened environment to express a little bit more.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   [Music]
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my plea.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   I have no defense, my guilt runs too deep.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   The best of my works pierced your hands and your feet.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my plea.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   [Music]
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my boast.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   The goodness I claim, the grounds of my home.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   Whatever I lack, it's still what I need most.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my boast.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.280]   [Music]
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   Praise the King who bore my sin.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   Took my place when I stood content.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   Oh, how good you've always been to me.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.280]   I will sing of your mercy.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   [Music]
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my rest.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   When fears lay me down and enemies press.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   Comfort I cling to in life and in death.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my rest.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   Praise the King.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   Praise the King who bore my sin.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   Took my place when I stood content.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   Oh, how good you've always been to me.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   I will sing of your mercy.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   [Music]
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my joy.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.280]   Forever I'll lift my heart and my voice.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   To sing of the treasure no power can destroy.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:25.280]   Jesus, your mercy is all my joy.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   Praise the King who bore my sin.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   Took my place when I stood content.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   Oh, how good you've always been to me.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.280]   I will sing.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   Praise the King who bore my sin.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   Took my place when I stood content.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   Oh, how good you've always been to me.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.280]   I will sing of your mercy.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   [Music]
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   [Music]
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   When the music fades, all is stripped away.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   And I simply come, longing just to bring
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:03.280]   Something that's of worth that will bless your heart.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   Is not what you have required.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   You search much deeper within, through the way things appear.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   You're looking into my heart.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   [Music]
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   King of endless.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.280]   King of endless worth.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   No one could express how much you deserve.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.280]   Every single breath with you.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.280]   I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   Is not what you have required.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   You search much deeper within, through the way things appear.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:00.280]   You're looking into my heart.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.280]   I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.280]   I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   Okay.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   Please take a moment to turn your Bible over to 2 Samuel chapter 12, verse 7 through 14.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:42.280]   And we're looking to the Scripture for encouragement as devotional, leading us into time of prayer.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   And we're going to be meditating and thinking about a very familiar situation and passage
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   involving King David, his moral failure and sin, leading to his repentance and contrite spirit.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:07.280]   So as we turn to this segment, we know the familiar story.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   It was essentially King David when there was already a lot of success.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   He should have still nevertheless been out with his soldiers.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   He should have been out with the military.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.280]   And yet he was resting on the roof of his palace.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   And upon looking at a beautiful woman, he exercised and abused his authority to take.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   And then in a scheme to cover it up, he planned to have the husband of that woman killed by the sword of enemies.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   And so, as you know, that story climaxes into a point where God uses Nathan the prophet
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   to go and do a setup by a simple, small little story.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   That there was a wicked man who was willing to kill a small young farmer and to take his wife
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   and to destroy everything he had.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   And if you remember, this was the setup that Nathan used to convict and then to rebuke and then to correct.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   So here is 2 Samuel 12, verse 7-14, where Nathan says to David, "You are that man."
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:31.280]   "Thus says the Lord God of Israel, 'It is I who anointed you king over Israel, and it is I who delivered you from the hand of Saul.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   I also gave you your master's house and your master's wife into your care, and I gave you the house of Israel and Judah.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   And if that had been too little, I would have added to you many more things like these.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.280]   Why have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in His sight?'"
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   When you hear these words, you hear God and His expression of feeling so offended
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   because King David, whom He loved, despised His word.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   But not only despised His word, He took it as a personal offense because He belittled His grace and His love.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.280]   "I would have given you so much. Was that not enough?"
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   That's the corrective, rebuking, and convicting words from God through Nathan.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   And so, what's crazy about this is we know that King David, his idea, his thoughts, and his intentions were actually to hide.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   And if he succeeded, he would have been experiencing so much destruction, shame, and pain.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   Take a look at the next portion.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   Nathan says, "You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, have taken his wife to be your wife,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Anan.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house because you have despised me."
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   And so, we hear again in God's words, He took personal offense to the sin that David thought he could cover up.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   He says, "You have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife,
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   and thus says the Lord, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own household.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   I will even take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion,
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.'
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   Indeed, you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and under the sun."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   What threat of great shame and display of what King David wanted to cover.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   And he says, "Then David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord.'
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   And Nathan said to David, 'The Lord also has taken away your sin; you shall not die.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   the child also that is born to you shall surely die.'"
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   I want to highlight that if, again, David succeeded at what he was trying to do,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   which was to try to just go on,
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   which was to, in his sinister scheme, make it seem like all was as it should be or all happened naturally,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   in some sense, in his eyes, that would have been success,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   but in another sense, he could have immediately died on the spot.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   He could have incurred incredible destruction to his entire kingdom,
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   and therefore, to David, this harsh threat,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   this correction that came with a pointed finger, "It's you!"
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   That was to King David mercy and grace, amen?
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:54.280]   That was to King David light, truth, and in many sense, a blessing.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   And so tonight, I want to challenge you.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   If there are any unresolved sins in your life by which you have not taken it to the Lord and said,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   "Here it is out on the table for you to see.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   I know you see it, but I'm acknowledging you see it.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   I know you see it all, but I am voicing that I have done wrong."
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   If there are any sins you thought, "You know, I know I failed today, but tomorrow I'll just do better,"
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:28.280]   and you have thought falsely in your mind that tomorrow things will just go back to normal,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   I want to challenge you that those things must be addressed
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   because by bypassing that kind of repentance,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   by bypassing that kind of confession and being bare before God,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   you completely bypass His grace.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:52.280]   You completely bypass His healing, His comfort, renewal, restoration,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   all of that which comes after, you bypass all of it.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   And so, turn your Bibles now to Psalm 51,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   and we'll take a moment to see how King David unpacked
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   the kind of restoration he was seeking from God through confession.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   And through this, we'll have some instruction and model of contrite prayer before the Lord.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   So as we take a look, the first point that I want to highlight to you comes from verse 1-2.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   Let's take a moment to read it.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   And King David goes before the Lord and he says,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   "Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your loving kindness,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   according to the greatness of Your compassion.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   Blot out my transgressions.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin."
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   And so as a point of instruction, we know in prayer we ought to appeal to God's mercy.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.280]   At the very beginning, the first words out of our mouth when we go before the Lord,
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   we need to appeal to God and His mercy.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.280]   You look at all the way that he is speaking and he says,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   "Be gracious according to Your loving kindness,
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   this great compassion You have, blot out my transgression."
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   It's amazing to me that this is written for us, for all the generations to hear, to read.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   And what's more, if you look at the little superscript above this,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   it says this was given to the choir director when Nathan came to David when he went into Bathsheba.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   He was willing to go and expose himself. Why?
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   Because God's threat isn't, "Therefore comes destruction," but rather, "In exposure there comes light."
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   And in this way, we should make sure that for us,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   we are not in any way trying to weasel, trying to maneuver, or trying to go about it another way.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   What I mean by that is, I think every single one of us can feel conviction,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   and every single one of us can feel remorse,
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   but sometimes, even though we know we ought to,
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:07.280]   we don't actually use the words of request, asking, or beseeching, or appealing.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.280]   What do I mean by that?
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   I think there are often times when we would use more diminished words.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.280]   Oftentimes, even between two individuals who are in some kind of conflict,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   the very words of, "Will you forgive me?" is hard to say.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   And so we often use the words of, "Hey, if I hurt you, I am sorry," right?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   Or, for a bunch of guys, we just say, "My bad." That's it.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   Thinking that so long as you know I feel bad about it, that's enough.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   What I'm trying to say is, here, even though between two individuals it's hard to say, "Will you forgive me?"
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   What we actually see is King David using words after words to say, "Purify me. Wash me. Heal me.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Would you please forgive me? Give me your grace."
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   It's a humble posture, and we don't presume that just because we walk to him,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   just because we have our head down, or just because we have puppy eyes,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   that God would automatically wash us.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   So, the first point being that we need to appeal to God's mercies,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   and we need to make sure that we actually ask.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   Point two, let's look at verses three through five.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   And what I want to exhort us to do is make sure that we're confessing things as God sees it.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.280]   Confess the things that are in our lives as the way the Lord sees it.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   Verse three, it says, "For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   Against you, you only, I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   so that you are justified when you speak and blameless when you judge.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in my sin my mother conceived me.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   Behold, you desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part you will make me know wisdom."
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   What I want to say here is notice how King David is describing his sin.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   Now, in reality, there are multiple layers.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   In reality, there were different things that he did.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:24.280]   Not only his lust, not only his selfish desire that moved him just to go and get for himself,
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   but everything that included trying to do cover-up, murderous intention,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   his arrogance and pride to tell Nathan, like, "There was a wicked man who did what?
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.280]   That guy should die!"
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   Yes, self-righteousness. There are so many different layers.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   But what King David did here is not use euphemisms for his sin.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   He doesn't say, "Oh, you know, it was a slip-up."
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   He doesn't have a wall of defense to say, "You know, I was so tired from the war.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   I was so weak. It was in a moment of weakness.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   You know that I didn't mean to?"
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   No, what he said was, he used these different words.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   Everything from transgression, which intentionally speaks to the breaking of law,
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   evil and wickedness, which talks to his moral depravity,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   iniquity, which is immorality and perversion,
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   his sins, which is completely missing the mark, and more.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   The exhortation simply is, when we look at our sins,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   let's make sure that we're thoroughly thinking through it the way God does.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   If we recall, the sins that King David committed, God came and did not say,
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   "How could you hurt these people?"
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   He said, "How can you despise me?"
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   The reach of our sin we have to consider.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   The effect of our sin and how deep it goes we must consider. Amen?
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   Third, we take a look at verses 7 through 12.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   King David continues to pray and he says this,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   "Purify me with hyssop and I shall be clean.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Make me to hear joy and gladness and let the bones which you have broken rejoice.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.280]   Hide your face from my sins and blot out my iniquities.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   Do not cast me away from your presence and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   Restore to me the joy of your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit."
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   If you take a look at this portion of this psalm,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   what King David is doing is he's trusting God for all the fruits,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   for all the treasures of being close to God.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   He is trusting God for cleansing.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   He is trusting God for comfort.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   He is trusting God for healing, renewal, and joy. Amen?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   If you look at what he's saying,
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.280]   King David has faith that if God purifies,
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   the emphatic point is then I'm going to be clean.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   If God washes, then I will be whiter than snow.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   If God speaks to me and I hear his voice, then I am going to rejoice.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   This is trust.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   You see, our issue, a lot of times our struggle is,
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   sometimes after we sin, sometimes after we have some type of failure,
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   we are going to feel lots of emotions, including feeling dirty and shameful.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.280]   We're going to feel remorse, and we're going to wonder,
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   "Ugh, why do I struggle with this?" Right?
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   We're going to feel a level of disappointment with ourselves,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   and it's in those moments there has to be this trust to say,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   "The fruits of what I want to see in me,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   the frustration that I feel of my own sins,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.280]   the desire to overcome, I trust God with all of that.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.280]   If he washes me, I will be clean."
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   We know we need perseverance.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   We know we need to be steadfast.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.280]   Sometimes we doubt, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   Am I going to sin again just in the next month?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   I'm going to completely, completely trip over myself and sin again?"
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   In those times, what are we supposed to think?
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   We're supposed to pray, and we're supposed to trust,
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   "Lord, you will sustain me with a willing spirit."
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   That's the level of trust we're supposed to have.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   And finally, King David prays.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   Verse 13, "Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   and sinners will be converted to you.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation,
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   that my tongue will joyfully sing of your righteousness.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   O Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare your praise.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.280]   For you do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   You are not pleased with burnt offering.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise."
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   One of the key things here is King David's trust
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   that moves him to be resolved to obey.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   But I want to give a very, very important distinction.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   Because I think I hear some people, and even my own heart, talk like this.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   When it comes to obedience,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   there is a huge difference between trusting yourself and trusting God.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   But how does that difference sound?
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   How does that difference sound if you're trusting in yourself versus trusting God?
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.280]   On one hand, if you're trusting in your own flesh,
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   you'll be saying things like this,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   "I promise you, I promise you, I'll never do it again.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   I promise you, I promise you, I won't ever lay a hand on another woman.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   Better yet, I won't even look at another pretty girl."
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   Do you hear King David say that?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   Now, is there something wrong with saying something like that?
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   No, that's expected.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   King David should never, ever do anything like that again,
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   even if he feels like he has every right to as a king.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   Even if he feels like he has all the power, and he has all the authority,
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   and even if he feels like he can point to any other king and say,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   "You know what? Other kings do it."
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   And he says, "No, I won't ever do that again." Right?
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   But the difference here is, he says,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   "When you teach me, then I will sing."
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   The emphatic point here, he says,
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   "When you have washed me, when you have delivered me, then I will sing.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   When you place joy in my heart, then I will sing."
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   The difference here is, it's not just simply, "I wish I was better.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   I wish simply that I get over this. I wish I don't struggle with this anymore."
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   He's not just simply thinking about exactly what he says,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   just offering goats, bulls, and burnt offering.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   What he's thinking about is his clarity of his conscience,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   that his heart is filled with the praises of God.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   That's a huge distinction.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   And so I hope that when we think about
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   what it means for us to move from our sins,
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   that we're thinking about what it means to be restored with joy.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   And the reason why I'm saying this is because
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   if you've ever struggled and wondered,
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   "Why don't I feel the kind of joy?
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   Why don't I feel the kind of clarity?"
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   Then maybe it's because we haven't gone through this kind of process with God.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   You guys know there is no shortcut to feeling reconciled,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   whether it's between you and somebody else,
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   like your wife, your friend, your sibling, your parents.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   No reconciliation, even amongst human relationships, goes from,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   "Hey, you know I feel bad. We're good, right? Okay."
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   But rather there's this interaction,
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   trusting, requesting, receiving, believing,
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   wanting more than just simply the overcoming of my woes,
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   but rather sweetness of fellowship.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   If we've sinned against God,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   if we've done reconciliation with God correctly,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   we should be at a much more elevated degree of intimacy with Him.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.280]   If we've sinned this week,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   then tonight is an opportunity for us to go even further with God.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   Deeper trust, deeper love, deeper reconciliation. Amen?
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   Let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Heavenly Father,
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   this is an example from the past that we are well familiar.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   And God, it humbles us to remember that even such a mighty person,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   even such an individual as accomplished as King David,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   would be so weak to the flesh and fall before you.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   And then we can see the ramifications of sin.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   We pray, Father God, that we too would humble ourselves
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   and recognize just the depth of our sin.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   But Lord, help us to make sure that we do not run,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   we do not hide, and we do not become defensive.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   Help us, Father God, to not scheme our own devices to cover up our filth.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   But God, knowing, Lord, that you are the God of all mercy and all grace,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   I pray, God, that our repentance would be thorough,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   that our confession before you, God, would be deep.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   And Lord, tonight, as we have opportunity to do so together,
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   would you lead us by your Spirit?
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   As we have the background music for prayer time,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   I want to encourage all of you guys.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   We're going to just put up the several points of how we can pray through this psalm.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   And at this point, if those of you guys who are up at the front could help us,
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   we're just going to remove the first couple rows of the white chairs into the stacks.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   For those of you guys in the back, you can go ahead and start praying.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   And then we'll give you guys about five to ten minutes to pray before the Lord on this psalm.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.280]   Thank you.

[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.280]   I want you to say a prayer for us before we move to the next portion.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Heavenly Father, as we each individually bow our heads before you
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   to examine our heart and take time to confess,
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   Lord, I pray, God, that you would truly shed light
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   because, God, when you shine light on us
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.280]   and we actually take time to examine our hearts,
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   there's so much, not only fleshly lust,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   not only ambition, not only idolatry,
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   finances, whatever it may be, but there's fear of man,
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   there are deep-rooted sins.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   But all these things, Lord, God, we are so grateful
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   because we know it is your desire and your design
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   to wash us from each one of these things.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   And so thank you.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   And we pray, God, that through the ministry of the Spirit,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.280]   through the ministry of your powerful Word,
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   that our church will be sanctified from these things.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   We know, God, that you desire to see your church be holy.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   We know, God, that residing within this place,
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   you want it to be filled with the things of Christ.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   And so we pray, God, that we would cut off and put away
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   all that is ignoble, all that is distasteful in your eyes,
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   so that, God, we would continue to experience your grace fully.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:46.280]   And the next slide, if I could ask the AV team
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   to just focus in on the common areas of sin.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   Okay.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   Yeah, the one on ongoing corporate prayer topics,
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   the list that's on the left side.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   So I want to just highlight that, you know,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   when we think about the will of God,
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   the will of God is to build up the church.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   And it has been our conviction,
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   everything from 1 Corinthians chapters 12 through 14,
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   Romans chapter 12 through 15,
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   God has said in this time he wants everything to be done
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.280]   for the edification of the church,
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   meaning he is pursuing the sanctification of the body, right?
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   That we are speaking truth to one another in love,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   we are speaking words of exhortation, correction, rebuke,
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.280]   love, encouragement, comfort, and more,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   singing spiritual songs and hymns
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   so that we mutually edify.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   And so at this time, let's focus our attention
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.280]   first on the things that are on your left,
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   the common areas of sin.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   Please think about, within your circles,
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   the people you're talking to,
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   what are the areas that people are wrestling with now?
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.280]   I would, you know, venture to assume
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   that a lot of people, they might not be
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   in some kind of gross compromise,
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.280]   but perhaps their main prayer request is,
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   I am so not focused.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   I kind of waste a ton of time, I veg out,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   the day is long, I'm tired, I'm fatigued,
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   and so I turn to this form of rest.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   A lot of things that are completely vain, useless,
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   and then sometimes it's just desensitizing you to the spirit
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   and therefore Satan is winning,
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   causing us to be luggish, right?
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   So let's pray against those common areas of sin.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   Let's think about our church
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   and the push for the discipline of prayer.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   I mean, we're doing it now, we've been talking about it,
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   but let's pray that each individual
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   knows what it means conceptually
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   but also is practicing walking in the spirit
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   and praying in the spirit, amen?
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   And then let's also pray anything that you've heard
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   of the people that you're in connection with,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   if they're in need of prayer for perseverance,
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   if they're going through trials,
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   if they're going through hardship because of loss,
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   because of their own just ailments
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   or maybe people in their family,
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   let's lift them up, okay?
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   So for the next five to ten minutes,
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   let's pray over these things together.

[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   >> I'd like to introduce the next set of prayer topics that we can lift up together.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   In one sense, the retreats are just awesome events for us to come together, have extended time together in our affinity groups, and to learn.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   But in another sense, I mean, without prayer, without preparation, we can essentially go up to the mountain, have a great time, and come back, right?
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   So we want to really pray. Actually, the retreats are supposed to be times when we purposely leave behind all the distraction, focus our minds, and in many ways, actually, if we have deep moments of sobriety, deep moments of seeing God's perspective, we could have a huge shift in worldview.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   And that would be amazing. That would bear so much fruit.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   So let's pray for that. And if you look at the topics, college ministry, youth group ministry, and also our band ministry, all the topics are kind of similar.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Just getting our minds ready so that for the college ministry, you know, life outside of the college context, being prepared and ready for what's coming, right?
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   The challenges that are going to come, let's pray for fruit in that.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:42.280]   The youth group ministry, I'm going to be preaching lessons talking about how if we have the right worldview, we are constantly being attacked, and we're in a battle.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:48.280]   We are in hostile grounds against the entire world, our own flesh, and our enemy, and more.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   So we need to be in a fight for the faith.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   And the band ministry is going to be talking about knowing that this is the end times, meaning that next on the agenda is the coming of Christ.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   We have to be sober. We have to be self-controlled.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   So let's pray that those times would be really impactful times where all of our minds would be properly adjusted.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   Our worldview would be set to be more biblical, okay?
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   Let's also pray for the India trip.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:28.280]   They are coming back tomorrow, but let's then pray that all the people they came in contact with, the students who came to VBS, the people in the villages that came to the clinics,
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   let's pray that they were either impacted deeply, they heard the gospel, and pray for their salvation.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.280]   Let's continue to lift up the pastors there who are continuing to do the work.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:49.280]   And then also our team member that they would leave a lasting witness for the Lord in their word, in their conduct, in their behavior, even through the travels, even to their drivers,
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   that they would have left an impression of Christ while they were there.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   And then, please, please lift up the children's ministry from our youngest babies up until our high school.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   Now, I know actually when you think about our church right now, because we're growing, there's needs like all over.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:15.280]   We can be praying for marriages, we can be praying for, you know, family ministry, etc.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:27.280]   But what the area where there's actually a booming growth and actually right now can be such a growing area of our affinity is our young children.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   At a church our size, that ministry is growing so fast, and you guys probably feel it.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.280]   That the generations, how it changes from one generation to the generation is so fast.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.280]   Even if you're not a whole lot younger than, let's say, the high schoolers, you probably look back and be like, "Whoa, things are different."
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:58.280]   You could almost feel the world coming after them, the influences of society, the lurements of desire, whatever is available to them.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   And so, let's pray that God will protect them.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   Let's pray that since they're in our midst, that the Lord will provide spiritual insight for them, conviction at a young age.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:17.280]   Let's pray for their salvation and the young ones who are receiving faith, that they would have assurances that are set.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:26.280]   Let's pray for their discipleship, and let's definitely lift up all the teachers, and particularly the parents, where the teachers are supporting them.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.280]   Coming alongside and praying for their kids.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   Let's ask that God would strengthen and empower and embolden our parents to preach the gospel and model it in their homes.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:44.280]   Let's pray for that together now.

[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   to a friend, and just ask them, "Hey, can you pray for me and share?" But also the pastors
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.280]   and elders will be up here at the front stairs. For the next five to ten minutes, if you'd
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:29.280]   like to come, let us know how we can pray for you. We'll take some time now to pray
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   for each other before we close the night. Thanks.
