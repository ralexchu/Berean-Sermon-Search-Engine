[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:10.140]   - Hello everyone.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.040]   We're gonna be starting our Bible study week,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.320]   number 10 on Ephesians chapter three,
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.840]   verses seven through 13.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.600]   Now I do wanna make a quick announcement
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.440]   that this week we'll have this Bible study
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.920]   and then the following week starts our Easter services.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200]   And so as you recall,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200]   there is going to be Monday through Thursday,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.040]   evening 7.30 p.m. devotions.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120]   And then, excuse me, on Friday,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.520]   there's going to be our Good Friday evening service at 7.30.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800]   And then we'll have one Easter service at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.080]   And then we'll pick back up
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.700]   onto the Ephesians Bible study the week after.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.000]   Would you take a moment to pray with me
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160]   as we begin our study?
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.240]   Lord, we thank you God for your grace.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.800]   Thank you Father for your love and mercies.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   Thank you God that you have allowed us
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.820]   to be a part of your redemptive plan.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.040]   You have allowed us Father God,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.620]   such great privileges and blessings in your salvation.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.660]   And I pray Lord that by faith,
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.900]   we would continue to grasp
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800]   and understand the depth of our privilege,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.520]   the depth of our blessing to greater degrees.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   We thank you Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.400]   Okay, as we take a look at the passage,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840]   what I would like to do is take a moment
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.760]   to read verses one through seven.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.360]   So please take your Bibles and follow along with me.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.840]   What I'll do is set up my PowerPoint really fast.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.360]   In verse one, it says,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.920]   for this reason, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780]   for the sake of you Gentiles,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.000]   if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.200]   which was given to me for you,
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.660]   as I wrote before in brief.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.360]   By referring to this, when you read,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140]   you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.360]   which in other generations was not made known
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.060]   to the sons of men,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.680]   as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.060]   and prophets in the spirit.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.640]   To be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.400]   and fellow members of the body
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.800]   and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.200]   through the gospel of which I was made a minister
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.640]   according to the gift of God's grace,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.240]   which was given to me according to the working of his power.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.720]   We take a moment to pause there
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.380]   and review what he's been saying.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.280]   Recall that the end of chapter two,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   apostle Paul said that Christ has made us into one.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.960]   And as he was talking about the ramification of the gospel,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.920]   he emphasized that the church is a building,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.040]   it's a household, and importantly, it is a temple of God.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.200]   And that signified God's dwelling place.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.360]   That signified that God was building a place
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.160]   for by which he could meet his people.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.560]   And so that has incredible significance for us.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.320]   And what's more, in this passage that I just read
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920]   in verse one through seven, he's emphasizing this truth.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.240]   If you really understand this,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.040]   this is an incredible mystery about the church.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   That what constitutes this temple and household of God,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.360]   surprisingly, is not just the chosen people of the old,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.620]   but rather it is inclusive of those
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.640]   who have previously considered without God so far,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   including all the Gentiles.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.400]   And so with that said,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   apostle Paul essentially challenges the audience
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.160]   and asks, do you actually understand?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.520]   And last week I made much of this point
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.760]   that apostle Paul is taking a moment
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.800]   to pause and ask the question, do you really understand?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.160]   Do you understand that in receiving this powerful gospel,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.880]   we receive the power of God to break every dividing wall,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.800]   the incredible wall that exists between us and God,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   and also the walls that exist between ourselves.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.080]   And so consequently, we recognize
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.600]   that what God is doing with the church
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.360]   is absolutely incredible, but also we recognize
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   that the church therefore is precious in God's sight.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   As we know that in scripture,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   our Lord Jesus Christ talks about in the gospels
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.220]   how he is building the church, right, Matthew 16,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.200]   how even the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.340]   The church is founded upon, established upon God's power.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.600]   It is established for God's glory.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.760]   It is empowered by the love of Christ,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.560]   and it continues to serve God's purpose.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.800]   And so the church is both vital
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.760]   and it's precious in the sight of God.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.880]   And what we see is that in Paul's attitude and perspective,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.360]   it's therefore precious in Paul's sight as well.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.400]   And so the passage that we have connects
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.080]   as apostle Paul speaks of his perspective
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.680]   in his ministry and servanthood towards the church,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.320]   towards the administration of the gospel.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.200]   Okay, so with that being said,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.160]   I'd like to read the passage for today.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.600]   I'm gonna read again verse seven and work our way down.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.840]   And the scripture says,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.000]   of which I have, sorry, of which I was made a minister
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   according to the gift of God's grace,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.500]   which was given to me according to the working of his power.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.180]   to preach to the Gentiles,
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.460]   the unfathomable riches of Christ,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.740]   and to bring to light what is the administration
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.280]   of the mystery, which for ages has been hidden in God,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.940]   who created all things,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.900]   so that the manifold wisdom of God
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.020]   might now be made known through the church
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.460]   to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.300]   This was in accordance with the eternal purpose,
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.060]   which he carried out in Christ Jesus, our Lord,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.400]   in whom we have boldness and confident access
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.020]   through faith in him.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.180]   Therefore, I ask you not to lose heart
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.400]   on my tribulations on your behalf,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.640]   for they are your glory.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.900]   I wanna begin by just giving you a brief kind of outline.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.180]   I've broken this section down into three parts,
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.240]   verse seven through nine,
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.420]   where it speaks of the apostle Paul's responsibility.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.100]   Verse 10 through 12, the grand purpose of God,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.900]   and verse 13, the encouragement that Paul gives.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.000]   Beginning with the first one,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.960]   Paul's perspective on his responsibility,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.320]   which was given to him by grace, okay?
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   Paul's perspective on his responsibility
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.360]   given to him by grace.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.040]   Let's take a look at this passage one more time.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.720]   It never hurts to read the passage again.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   And it says, "Of which I was made a minister
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.280]   "according to this gift of God's grace,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.240]   "which was given to me according
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.680]   "to the working of his power.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.320]   "To me, the very least of all the saints,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.000]   "this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.360]   "the unfathomable riches of Christ,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   "and to bring to light what is the administration
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.880]   "of the mystery which for ages has been hidden
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.920]   "in God who created all things."
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.520]   Okay, one of the observations that we make is,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.200]   throughout this passage, verses one all the way down,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   apostle Paul has various labels
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   or descriptions about himself.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.680]   And so one of the study questions is,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   let's label, or at least identify,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.720]   all of these descriptions.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   And what it really describes is apostle Paul's perspective
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.040]   on who he is in relationship to the gospel he's received.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.900]   Who he is in relationship to how God
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.160]   is going to now use him.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   And what I'd like to do is have you look at your Bibles
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.040]   and scan again with me, starting from actually verse one.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   Remember this section, verses two through 13,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.320]   was one paragraph, it's one long thought.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.720]   And within it, he has a lot to say about, again,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.080]   his perspective of where he fits.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   Verse one, he says, "I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.480]   "for the sake of you Gentiles."
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.360]   Right?
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.880]   And we have to take a moment to remember
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.100]   that he's literally in prison.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.920]   That's not a figurative statement.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.400]   That's not saying I'm so devoted.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   No, he's literally in prison, and it's not for two weeks.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.880]   It's not confinement or quarantine for just several weeks.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   We're talking potentially years here, right?
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.100]   Some commentators think it's up to four years
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.760]   that he's already been in prison.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   Verse two, he says, "If indeed you heard of the stewardship
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.440]   "of God's grace which was given to me for you."
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.480]   And so what you have then is Apostle Paul being a steward.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.960]   And I'm gonna highlight these for you here.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.000]   Apostle Paul is a steward.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.120]   He's a steward of the grace for the people.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.620]   Verse three, "That by revelation there was made known
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.840]   "to me this mystery as I wrote before in brief."
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.940]   And so then he becomes essentially a writer and a scribe,
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.680]   jotting down all that God has given him.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.760]   In verse seven, in this passage he says,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.680]   "Of which I was made a minister according to the gift
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.280]   "of God's grace which was given to me."
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.360]   So Apostle Paul is a minister by the grace and power of God.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.860]   And then in verse eight through nine, he says,
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.840]   "To me the very least of all saints, this grace was given
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.420]   "to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.420]   "of Christ and to bring to light what is the administration."
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.280]   So Apostle Paul clearly recognizes what is his calling,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.100]   what is his job, responsibility.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.120]   What God has given him by grace,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.100]   and that is to be a preacher.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.600]   Essentially a man who is to speak, open his mouth,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.120]   and be loud, to be an incredible light
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.040]   of the gospel of Christ.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.280]   And that much is very clear.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.340]   Now, as we think about this then,
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:08.280]   when we see Apostle Paul's perspective on his role,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.240]   that altogether is very challenging.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.740]   As Apostle Paul sees the stewardship,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740]   the ministry of the gospel, the administration
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.620]   of the gospel and the grace of God,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.660]   he recognizes then that he's a prisoner to all that.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.900]   He recognizes then that he's a minister to all of that.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.120]   And I want us to take a moment to dwell on that
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.440]   for a little bit.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   Because what that shows us is in his sight, the cause,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.900]   the responsibility is massive.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.040]   The magnitude of what God has called him to,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   already in his sights, he is showing to us
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.920]   what he sees and understands.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.400]   And what he says is profound,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.160]   because he says that he has been made a minister.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.960]   I want to highlight something here.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.140]   If we look up the word minister,
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.080]   it's the Greek word diakonos.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.520]   And that's where we get the word deacon.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.400]   But essentially, when that word was used
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.160]   outside of the church context, it meant servant.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.880]   It meant somebody who was a lowly servant,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.800]   who was more like a busboy.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.120]   It was somebody who was like a waiter, so to speak.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   It was somebody who would clean up after the mess.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.960]   And so when you think about this,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.240]   it's not some classy leader.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.000]   He's not a spokesperson.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.520]   He's not deemed as a great guest speaker.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.400]   He is seeing himself as a role subservient
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.960]   to the great cause of the administration of God.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.800]   And that's exactly how he actually tells the church
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.200]   to consider him.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.740]   Take a look at 1 Corinthians chapter four,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.960]   verses one through two.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.320]   Apostle Paul says this.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.700]   "Let a man regard us in this manner,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.280]   "as servants of Christ and stewards
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.400]   "of the mysteries of God.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.280]   "In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.760]   "that one be found trustworthy."
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.600]   Here in this passage, Apostle Paul takes it
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.120]   even to another step, where he describes himself
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.380]   as hupertest, which just simply means you're an underling.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.240]   He sees himself as a servant of the stewardship
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.560]   of these great mysteries of God.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   And the way that I want to think about this is,
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.280]   you know, a lot of people make much of
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.640]   being a part of a great cause.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.280]   And it makes them feel like, wow, that was so rewarding.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.680]   Even if, let's say, they weren't paid for it.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.360]   And you know what I'm talking about.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.560]   People in this day, they talk about being a part
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.160]   of a great movement that really inspires them.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.440]   And yes, those are inspiring, especially, let's say,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.720]   if we're talking about disaster relief movements,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.820]   when we're talking about crisis scenarios,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.280]   and we're willing, because the cause is so great,
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   then to take a moment's pause from our daily activities.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.400]   People, when they are willing to sacrifice
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.600]   the security of their jobs, they let it go,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.960]   and they go join a cause, is that a bad thing?
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   No, that's actually a great thing,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.520]   especially if that cause is something worthwhile and noble.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.000]   What's really interesting to me is that people do that
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.720]   for lots of different causes.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.600]   If they get a chance to, let's say, travel on tour
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.040]   with the band that they love, with the team that they love.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.800]   And sometimes, I've been seeing right now,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.320]   there's a lot of game shows, reality TVs.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   And people are straight up willing to risk their job
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   so that they devote full time into something
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.000]   like American Ninja or something like that.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.200]   Now, if that was your dream, I'm not trying to crush it,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.400]   but here's what I'm saying.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.320]   Apostle Paul, here and now, is showing to us,
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   in his perspective, his sight, his appreciation
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.440]   for the grandeur of God's call,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   for the absolute, just sheer magnitude of a cause so big,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   it just naturally causes us to lose sight
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.400]   of our little significance.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.120]   See, Apostle Paul, he's not elated, he's not grateful,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.880]   because he was a leader before, clearly, right?
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.080]   When he was a Pharisee, when he was a Sadducee,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.680]   when he was a leader amongst leaders,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.560]   and thank goodness, now he gets to become another leader.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.520]   Now he gets to become a spokesperson.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.360]   No, that's not what he's thinking.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.120]   What he's thinking is the cause of God is so great,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.640]   it absolutely makes him subservient.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.280]   It causes him to be a servant of the cause of Christ.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.040]   And so he recognizes the ministry of God is so massive.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.520]   You see, one of the things I want to challenge us
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.840]   in that moment, then, is to ask,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   last time we recognized that Apostle Paul
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.800]   was teaching about the gospel,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.080]   and again, how mind-blowing it should be,
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   to take us from dead to life, to take us from far to near.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.880]   And that shift, we have to regularly stop and ask,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.520]   do we actually appreciate and understand
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.480]   the magnitude of the gospel?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.280]   Otherwise, all of these roles that I just highlighted
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.880]   for you, being a prisoner, a steward, a writer,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.520]   a minister, and a preacher,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.520]   none of these things will be privileges for you.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.560]   None of them will be worthwhile.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.320]   All of the things actually could be
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.440]   very well a burden to you.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.600]   And as a matter of fact, if I come to you then,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.920]   and you actually don't understand and grasp
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.840]   with Apostle Paul,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.960]   the incredible cause that we are a part of,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   then if I come and say, hey, can I ask you to do something?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.760]   Then your first response wouldn't be, yes, what can I do?
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.600]   Your first response would be like, oh, what is it, right?
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.360]   There would be hesitancy.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.040]   You would have to start asking, like, is it worth it?
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.720]   But what if these questions were asked of you
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.920]   to be a small part, perhaps, to be in God's wisdom?
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.000]   Remember how this church was called a body,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.400]   and within the body you had presentable parts
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   and unpresentable parts?
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.520]   The parts that you want to show off, you know?
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.800]   And the parts that you just kind of want to hide?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.040]   I share with people all the time,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.200]   I have really ugly hands, right?
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.560]   They're very fat, they're like, it almost looks,
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.000]   one time someone looked at my hands
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.680]   and they turned around and asked me, like,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.720]   your hands are swollen, and I said, oh no,
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.520]   it's not swollen, that's just the way it looks.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.280]   And we just had a fun laugh, right?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.520]   But think about that for a moment.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.800]   For the great cause of highlighting
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.520]   the great redemptive privileges in Christ,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.680]   the glory that we have in Christ,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   should God ask you, be the hands, the calloused hands,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.280]   be the feet, the sweaty feet.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.960]   Is that to us a privilege because we understand
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.160]   the greatness of what God is calling us?
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   Or do we have hesitancy to think, like,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.880]   I want to be a steward, but I don't want to be a steward
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.320]   of the janitorial supplies, I want to be a steward
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   of the proclamation on the pulpit, right?
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.740]   Like, what are we actually willing and wanting,
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.160]   because we understand the magnitude of the cause.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.720]   And we also know that in the future,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.160]   Apostle Paul is going to call us.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.680]   This is not just for pastors,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   this is not just for the preachers.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.080]   He's going to call every single one of us later on
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.680]   in chapters three, four, and five, chapter four and five,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.320]   what we should be in imitation of Apostle Paul,
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.720]   but even greater, of God himself.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   Now, in thinking about this then,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.800]   there is this challenge, which is,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.640]   Apostle Paul, in his perspective,
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.560]   he has a response and an attitude that shows forth.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.880]   And his attitude I summarize as,
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.080]   I humbly and greatly accept.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   Okay, I humbly and greatly accept.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.900]   You see, when we think about our possible responses,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.960]   Apostle Paul was not necessarily, like, given choices.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.680]   Do you want to be the spokesperson,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.800]   or would you like to be the background player?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   God didn't give him those choices.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.440]   Apostle Paul says, "God gave me this privilege."
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   Now, what's interesting is,
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.160]   there are different responses, perhaps.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.240]   For example, someone could have this impervious attitude
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   and say, "You know what?
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.500]   "Yes, I get it, the Lord gave me a call.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.580]   "Like, how am I supposed to respond to that?
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.080]   "You know, I don't really have a choice here, right?
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.520]   "I just have to be like, well, thanks, big guy,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.120]   "and then I got to do it, right?"
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.800]   And they might have just this really kind of
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.440]   bitter, unfair mentality and attitude.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.040]   Or we can do a Moses.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.400]   You know, "Lord, no thank you.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.480]   "I stutter."
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.560]   You know, like, that's what Moses did.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.220]   Or on another scene, Moses went,
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.800]   "I got a better idea, what about that guy?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.180]   "You send him.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.100]   "I've got good ideas.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.320]   "I like to play the supportive role.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.360]   "We'll send Aaron."
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.240]   Right, like, we could have different kind of responses.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.760]   Or Apostle Paul, he essentially almost, like,
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.560]   repeats multiple times, starting from verse two.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.440]   He talks about this gift, this grace.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.800]   I highlight for you here in verse seven, he says,
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.440]   "According to the gift,"
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.240]   like, this is grace, okay, grace given.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.440]   "And according to the working of his power."
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.040]   Think about that.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.700]   When you say this is a gift, an intentional gift of God
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.040]   and the working of his power, that precludes,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.580]   that excludes them, like, "Oh, God,
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.360]   "did you, like, accidentally, you know, tag me?
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.600]   "I think you meant to tag him."
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.640]   Like, there's none of that.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.760]   This is God's intentional giving of grace to us.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.960]   And you have to understand that this intentional gift of God
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.720]   includes Apostle Paul being a prisoner, right?
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.840]   And what's crazy is if you look at Philippians 1:29,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.040]   Apostle Paul essentially states this.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.160]   He says, "Not only have we been given the privilege
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.900]   "to know the gospel,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.000]   "but the privilege to suffer for the gospel."
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.920]   This is God's gift.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.400]   "And the way he receives it is humbly
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.280]   "and gratefully, I accept."
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.260]   He says, "Oh," like, almost like, "Me?"
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.100]   Take a look at verse eight.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.660]   "To me, the very least of all the saints."
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.760]   I mean, think about the contrast of attitude.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.600]   On one side, it's like, "Did you get this right?
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.440]   "Like, did you mean to call on me?"
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.060]   But Apostle Paul on the flip side is like,
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.680]   "Oh, wow, like, me, you wanna use me?"
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.880]   This is an entirely different kind of attitude.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.900]   And what's more in humility, he considers,
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.480]   "Lord, I am the least of all the saints."
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.800]   Now, again, Apostle Paul here at this moment,
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.880]   he didn't just get converted.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.600]   He's already been, like, traveling, preaching.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.840]   He's been standing up to the Jews.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.400]   I mean, throughout so many different instances,
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.800]   he preached with authority and boldness.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.200]   Some people hailing him, some people hating him.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.400]   He's not, essentially, he's not a noob, right?
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   From the time that he was converted,
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.080]   many people actually believe
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.280]   that more than 10 years has passed.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.320]   So that means he's not necessarily
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.600]   at the beginning of his ministry.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.340]   He's in the latter part.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.120]   And for him to say, "I'm the least of saints,"
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.480]   what he's doing there, he's not just being, like,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.240]   overly dramatic.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.840]   He has the right perspective.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.140]   Is he worthy to have this privilege?
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.200]   Is it because of his merit, his know-how,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.640]   his prestige, his reputation,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.760]   and how everybody already knows him?
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.280]   No, it is not.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.480]   He recognizes that the grace to be a part
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.760]   of the gospel ministry is just that, it's grace.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.360]   He's not deserving of this and that.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.280]   So what humility?
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.120]   Like, I love it.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   What kind of, like, realistic, God-honoring humility?
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.520]   And this kind of humility flies against
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.940]   what I think modern kind of leadership training
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.480]   is all about, where it's like,
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.680]   you need to exercise your full potential,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.880]   and you need to have those opportunities
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.360]   to showcase your giftings of, come on.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.740]   Like, that is not the way Apostle Paul
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.560]   is thinking about this privilege.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.520]   He's thinking about how he is a servant of the church.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.240]   He's a servant of the household of God.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.160]   And as a servant, then, he is also willing
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.480]   to be slave and prisoner.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.880]   He loves the church, cherishes the church.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.180]   He cherishes the people of God.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.320]   And to their glory and to their benefit,
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.560]   he is willing to be like a mother, a father,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.500]   a brother, and worse, busboy.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.840]   And his delight is to serve the church.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.240]   He sees it as a unique privilege.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.520]   And so by way of conviction, I want to say,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.960]   Apostle Paul has this kind of attitude,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.000]   the way I like to summarize it is, I get to.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.220]   It's not a do I have to?
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.900]   It is an I get to.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.320]   I get to preach the unfathomable riches of Christ.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.720]   Brothers and sisters, if you're in the habit
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.440]   of being all apologetic, when you encourage people,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.640]   like, God loves you, you know,
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.600]   or even the, you need to turn to God, right?
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.120]   And when you preach the gospel to unbelievers,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.080]   please don't be so apologetic,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.720]   where perhaps you've come to them,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.280]   saying, I don't want to bother you.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.840]   I'm sorry to bother you.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.060]   You know, if you're telling somebody
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.300]   that you have an opportunity to be rich
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.460]   underneath the loving, the fatherly love
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.340]   of the master of the universe, the king of the world,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.220]   I'm not sure you have to be apologetic, right?
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.460]   But rather, you should be ecstatic.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.580]   You should be joyful.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.740]   You should be eager.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.980]   Now, Paul says, I get to preach
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.680]   the unfathomable riches of Christ.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.440]   You know, we have a lot of teachers within our church,
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.400]   and so shout out to you guys.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.060]   We appreciate you.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.240]   We, you know, encourage you and support you,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.760]   especially in this time when things are crazy.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.680]   And the thing about it is I love it when teachers say,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.000]   like, man, you know, there are these students
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.880]   who you see their eyes go bright,
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.740]   and they have those aha moments,
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.820]   and, you know, even beyond all the endless nights
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.620]   of grading papers, you know, I relate to teachers
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.700]   because lesson prep, you know, lesson prep is so hard.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.540]   There's no end.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.740]   I mean, like, you could always think of a better example.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.700]   Sometimes you get done seeing an example,
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.260]   and you're like, I don't even know
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.380]   if that came across right, and it's hard, right?
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.660]   But isn't it rewarding?
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.740]   Isn't there, like, this intrinsic rewarding privilege
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.900]   to bring to light?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.020]   And that's what Apostle Paul says.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.440]   Like, he is going to be bringing to light
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.660]   what is the administration and the mystery,
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.300]   the dispensation, the management of God,
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.700]   and that to him is his delight.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.500]   He gets to do this for the people.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.180]   And so, therefore, again, we see Apostle Paul's mentality.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.540]   He's not saying, sorry, sorry I get to teach you
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.460]   and shed light to you in your dark world.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.660]   No, Apostle Paul, to him, this is a privilege.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.020]   And so, again, I spent a lot of time on this
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.860]   because I believe this is the emphasis.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.640]   We, brothers and sisters,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.680]   are a part of something so massive,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.600]   it transcends time, space,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.840]   and even whatever we think are the limits.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   It just transcends everything.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.460]   And so, to that, I want to move to the next section.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.640]   We are a part of something so grand,
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.680]   and God reveals to us that he has
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.940]   this grand intentional purpose for the church.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.020]   I'll read for us verse 10.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.300]   It says, "So that," again, highlighting,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   whenever you see the so that, you should pause and say,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.100]   okay, purpose statement, purpose clause.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.780]   I should understand what God is intending to do.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.840]   What's this for?
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.260]   The manifold wisdom of God might be now,
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.180]   sorry, might now be made known through the church
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.400]   to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.300]   This was in accordance with the eternal purpose
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.020]   which he carried out in Christ Jesus, our Lord,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.260]   in whom we have boldness and confident access
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.260]   through faith in him.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.200]   Wow.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.300]   I asked this question as a Bible study question.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.260]   What is God's intended role for the church?
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.260]   And it's really clear, right?
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.540]   We don't have to necessarily go look up word study
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.500]   and things like that.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.740]   What is very clear is that there is an overarching,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.380]   umbrella vision of God for the church
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.100]   that he desires to make known his own wisdom
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:34.100]   to everything, to the heavenly places, to the world,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.800]   that the revelation of God, the character trait,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.220]   not just one trait, but the manifold, multiplying
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.740]   wisdom of God be made known through the church.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.060]   And so the way I labeled it in your handout is
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.740]   this is a cosmic showcase.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   Two, and what's interesting here, are the heavenly beings.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.980]   This is very interesting.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.660]   I'm not gonna make more of it than I can
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.680]   because this is like an opening of a door
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.860]   where he's giving us sight into God's plans
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.780]   beyond what we can see with our eyes.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.900]   We recall that our significance in the world
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.960]   is even smaller than sometimes we think
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.260]   because the world as we know it is just so tiny.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.300]   But the world as God knows it is massive.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.780]   There are heavenly hosts, right?
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.220]   Hosts.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.660]   There's myriads and myriads, scripture says.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.740]   There are angels, there are mighty ones of God,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.540]   there are seraphim and cherubim
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.020]   and all kinds of heavenly beings.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.620]   And then there are those who are rulers and authorities,
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.380]   those enemies of God perhaps.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.540]   Ephesians chapter six describes there are these like circles
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.060]   and hierarchies of the demonic forces
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.580]   and there's legions of them, right?
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.780]   There's legions of them.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.540]   Understand this, this is profound,
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.160]   but again, perhaps we won't know too exhaustively.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.180]   God is going to showcase his church
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.220]   as a means to shame the enemies of God
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.140]   and to show forth his amazing power
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.940]   and his rich love through the church.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.980]   He is going to showcase his wisdom through the church.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.420]   Here's an interesting passage.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.620]   First Peter chapter one, verse 12.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   It was revealed to them, that's the angels,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.980]   that they were not serving themselves but you
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.420]   in these things which now have been announced to you
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.380]   through those who preach the gospel to you
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.220]   by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.900]   things into which angels long to look.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.860]   The redemptive plan of God is so profound,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.220]   it's so amazing that even the heavenly hosts
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.380]   carefully look into.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.100]   And so what I want to highlight is not only
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.700]   is there this heavenly purpose for the church,
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.420]   but there is also an eternal purpose.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.140]   God has for the church an eternal purpose
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.200]   where he says that this was in accordance
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.020]   with the eternal purpose carried out in Christ Jesus,
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.060]   our Lord.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.980]   The redemptive plan, the history that we see,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.660]   all of it, although it's been riddled
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.860]   with sin, waywardness, destruction, and hardship,
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.500]   all of that, throughout all of that,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.260]   God was still sovereignly working his redemption.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.900]   I want to highlight some interesting passages for you.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   In Ephesians chapter one, Apostle Paul says this,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.940]   and he put all things in subjection under his feet
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.700]   and gave him as head over all things to the church,
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.060]   which is his body, the fullness of him
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.540]   who fills all in all.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.780]   Just take a moment to recall.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.580]   The Jewish people, the people of God,
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:49.580]   have been waiting so long for somebody to come over them,
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.900]   for a king, for one who would provide,
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.180]   who would be their provision, their protection,
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.220]   who would be their leader.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.220]   We essentially have that in Christ in the church.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.060]   And what's more, in verse 27, it says,
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.900]   "And he raised them up and seated us with him
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.780]   "in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.020]   "so that in the ages to come,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.860]   "he might show the surpassing riches of his grace
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.860]   "in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus."
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.420]   You know, what's pretty amazing
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.860]   is that God is not just going to use the church
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.460]   for a season, during hardships,
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.980]   maybe in 2020, right, he's gonna use our church.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.540]   No.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.140]   Those who are redeemed, God has chosen to use us
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.980]   to showcase his rich, rich love for all eternity.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.060]   In heaven, we are going to be singing
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.220]   with united voices, perfected voices,
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.900]   the glories of God's grace, his love and his mercies.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.940]   It's gonna be amazing.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.420]   And I think about this, the privilege within this passage,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.020]   Apostle Paul highlights this incredible privilege
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.100]   that we are going to be able to approach God,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.420]   that we are going to be able, with boldness
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.220]   and with confidence, access God.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.260]   And that to us is an incredible privilege
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.020]   and a great, great mystery.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.260]   That to us is also a wisdom of God,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.100]   that God would create an avenue
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.860]   by which unholy, evil, wicked individuals
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.460]   would be able to approach a holy God without dying.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.180]   It's going to be through union with Christ.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.460]   Now, I want, just to highlight that one thing
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.140]   for a little bit, I want you to think about this.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.900]   We're thinking about stuff that's like beyond us, right?
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.380]   Heavenly realms, angels, you know,
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.820]   the authorities and the rulers.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.460]   Think about the incredible scene of Isaiah 6,
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.620]   where there are the host of angels around God.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.660]   The train of his robe is filling the temple.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.900]   The glory is shining greatly.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.420]   And even the angels, they have their eyes covered.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.780]   Now, think from their perspective, looking at us.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.740]   It's like, what?
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.260]   I am actually one of God's holy creatures,
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.340]   but I need to cover my mouth.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.580]   I need to cover my feet.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.260]   How is it that you, human,
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.220]   that you boldly and confidently approach God Almighty?
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   Right?
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.700]   The angels probably instinctually would be like,
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.900]   "Stop, holy ground."
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.540]   But I imagine this is all just reading in between the lines.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.340]   To angels, this would be quite the incredible thing,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.060]   to see humans who were once broken,
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.100]   lower than the angels, right?
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.540]   Now be raised to even greater than them.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.460]   That'd be pretty incredible, wouldn't it?
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.180]   A sight to see.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.100]   And so you think about this, God eternally desired.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.740]   Man, this part is really crazy.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   God eternally desired to show forth His incredible mercies,
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.140]   and He desired to do that in you.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:15.380]   Because God in His nature, with His fatherly love,
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.580]   desired to create and then be one with that creation
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.140]   as a father.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.500]   That is all initiated, thought out.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.820]   That's all from His heart.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.340]   That's all from His character.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.620]   And that's why He is good father.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.100]   To me, it's just like crazy to think about.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.740]   And so as we're thinking today
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.020]   and reflecting with Apostle Paul,
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.100]   the manifold wisdom of God is going to be shown forth
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.620]   for us who are but vapors in time,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.540]   for us who are but a breath,
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.660]   like a breath we see on a cold day.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.180]   God is going to eternally use us
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.140]   to showcase His wisdom and love.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.220]   And so I want to move forth into this kind of reflection.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:08.340]   For us then to appreciate this,
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.020]   we are again like trying by faith
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.260]   to see beyond our case, right?
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:18.100]   For us right now, as we look at our own time,
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.060]   our own kind of situation,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.380]   perhaps maybe you don't necessarily see it that way.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.860]   Like how am I a showcase of God's love, right?
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.900]   But here's an encouragement for you.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.580]   Verse 13, Apostle Paul says,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.580]   "Therefore I ask you, do not lose heart."
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.580]   Okay, why would they lose heart?
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.500]   Because they're looking at tribulation, right?
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.180]   Like they're looking at Apostle Paul's tribulation.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.700]   They're looking at their own tribulation.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.220]   So I want you to take a moment to think about this.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.220]   Across history, there has been incredible suffering.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.860]   And even secular historians would say
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.260]   our history throughout time is just a simple record
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.740]   of kings and kingdoms and the war in between.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.380]   That's what one historian said.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.900]   Another historian said,
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.500]   "Essentially our history is just riddled
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.740]   "with kingdoms and moving the map,
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.020]   "moving territories, moving the battle, so to speak."
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.900]   And then a not so famous historian,
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.140]   Henry Ford once said,
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.060]   "History is just one poopy thing."
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.100]   I say poopy, but he used another word I'm not going to say.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.140]   Just one poopy thing to another poopy thing.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.580]   That's what he said, right?
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:29.420]   In thinking about that, even in Ecclesiastes,
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.900]   the wise King Solomon said,
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.980]   "Listen, what is the point?
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.660]   "What is advantageous for a man
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.700]   "in all his work under the sun?
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.940]   "Generations come and generations go.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.380]   "The sun rises, the sun sets."
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.100]   And he goes on to say,
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.700]   "But still we cannot tell.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.700]   "We're not satisfied.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.740]   "We're not seeing and not hearing.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.460]   "We're not filled.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.020]   "And no one remembers.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.340]   "'Cause who can say there's anything new under the sun?"
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.180]   There is such a vanity in this world.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.260]   There is just so much pointlessness in this world.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.180]   And when we look at history,
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.740]   we might be tempted to think the same.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.220]   If we use our human eyes to evaluate our own lives,
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.380]   we're still surrounded by pagans.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.540]   There's still sin in the church.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.340]   There's still our weaknesses.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.740]   And if we're thinking about the church at Ephesus
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.620]   in this time as the readers of this letter,
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.820]   the guy who's preaching to them and saying,
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.020]   "Look, chapter one, God has blessed you.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.580]   "Look, chapter two, in the gospel you have life.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.060]   "You have completeness.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.540]   "You have redemption.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.420]   "You who are far have been brought near."
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.940]   And he's trying to show them the incredible love of God.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.220]   God loves you.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.700]   But they're hearing this from a guy in prison.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.540]   If we are only using our human eyes,
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.740]   none of this makes sense.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.820]   But through the eyes of our faith,
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.460]   we are learning.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.300]   Brothers and sisters,
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.900]   do not lose heart at the tribulations
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.060]   because we are a part of something huge
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.860]   that includes all of history as we know it.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.540]   For the secular individual,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.260]   all of history is just from one event to another.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.140]   All we can do is track kings and kingdoms and wars.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.220]   For us, we're seeing the intentional hand of God
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.660]   move all of history towards Christ
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.980]   and then the gospel that is going to redeem.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:34.100]   What we see is a masterful, powerful, loving God
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.740]   moving throughout history, but also moving in you.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.220]   God is going to use you eternally.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.180]   If you are in Christ, your life is eternal
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.460]   and you have absolute life, indestructible in Christ.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.740]   And therefore, we have then glorious expectation.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.300]   Well, what Apostle Paul is saying is,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.580]   yes, perhaps right now, suffering first.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.540]   Yes, perhaps right now, tribulation.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.740]   But remember, glory would come through suffering for Christ
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.500]   and likewise for us, it's the same.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.420]   And so Apostle Paul says, these tribulations,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.500]   they are serving to the end for your glory,
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.540]   that you be able to glory in Christ.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.940]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:24.500]   Lord, we thank you again for these encouraging words
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.820]   from your scripture.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.740]   We pray, Father God, that by faith, we would recognize,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.020]   Lord, that we have an indescribable privilege,
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.180]   an incredible weight of glory with Christ.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.740]   And Lord, that cause of sharing that light,
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.700]   the cause of sharing in the ministry of the gospel,
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.340]   Lord, that is the greatest privilege.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.260]   Father God, that is the singular cause
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.100]   where it would be appropriate to just jettison
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.540]   and forget everything else.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.340]   And I pray, Father God, that we would then share
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.020]   in the joys of the I get to's with Apostle Paul.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.980]   Lord, we thank you so much.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.580]   And I pray, God, that you would strengthen our faith.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.140]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.900]   Have a good week, everyone.
