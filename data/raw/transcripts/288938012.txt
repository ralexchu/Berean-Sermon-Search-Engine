[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Where are we going? Japan!
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Woo!
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [Music]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Your glorious cause, O God, engages our hearts.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   May Jesus Christ be known wherever we are.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We ask not for ourselves, but for Your renown.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   The cross has saved us, so we pray, Your kingdom come.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   so that everyone might know Your name.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   until Your sovereign work on earth is done.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Let Your kingdom come.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   [Music]
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Give us Your strength, O God, and courage to speak.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Perform Your wondrous deeds through those who are weak.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Lord, use us as You want, whatever the test.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   By grace we'll preach Your gospel 'til our dying breath.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   so that everyone might know Your name.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   until Your sovereign work on earth is done.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Let Your kingdom come.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   so that everyone might know Your name.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   until Your sovereign work is done.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Let Your kingdom come.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Let Your will be done, so that everyone might know Your name.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   until Your sovereign work on earth is done.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Let Your kingdom come.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Let Your kingdom come.
