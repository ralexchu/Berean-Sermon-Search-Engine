[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   All right, well, let me get started.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.200]   So we're in the book of Titus, and it's 46 verses, and there's a lot of fun stuff in
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.560]   here.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.500]   And before we begin, let me just open us up in a word of prayer, and then I'll give you
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.080]   some helpful informational little tidbits before you guys have a discussion, okay?
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.380]   Father, would you bless our study over the next few months, and would you teach us how
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.480]   to appropriately respond to your truth?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.720]   Help us to just grow, not just in knowledge, but in greater love for you and for one another,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   and that as we adorn ourselves with good deeds, and as we work hard to give you the glory
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.120]   that you do, I pray that you would bear fruit, and would you magnify yourself through the
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.280]   teaching of your word just this season?
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.080]   We entrust tonight into your hands, and there's going to be a lot of different awkward, clumsy
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440]   moments where we're trying to learn how to study your word.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.560]   Would you give us insight?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.920]   More than anything, would you cause our hearts to hunger for more of you?
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.240]   Would you guide the discussions, and would you instruct not just our heads, but our hearts
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.240]   as well?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.040]   All right, just there are two things that I want to just introduce before you guys get
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.920]   broken up into your small groups.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.400]   I'm going to be looking at Titus the man, the person, because we don't know too much,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.440]   okay?
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.000]   And also, he's on the island of Crete, and so just some helpful background that some
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.680]   of you guys might have already done, but some helpful background so that when we're reading
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.400]   the book of Titus, contextually, certain things make better sense, okay?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.520]   So for Titus, Paul likely met Titus on a second missionary journey of three, but Titus is
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   not mentioned at all in the book of Acts, so that's a little bit â€“ so it's a little
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   difficult to discern exactly when Titus came into Paul's life, but he's an important
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   figure.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.480]   And he's such an important figure that in 2 Corinthians alone, he's mentioned nine
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   times, okay?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.160]   And he's called like a partner and fellow worker.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.240]   There aren't many people who have as much praise heaped on them as Titus and Timothy
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.360]   by Paul, okay?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.120]   So Titus is a very important figure in the early church, even though he's not even mentioned
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.560]   in the book of Acts.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   So he was born a Gentile convert, and if you guys look at Galatians chapter 2, Paul doesn't
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.720]   circumcise him, but he does circumcise somebody else, right?
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.600]   Anybody know who that is?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.640]   Timothy.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.560]   He circumcises Timothy, who is a half Jew, half Gentile, but Titus, he leaves him be,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   okay?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080]   And I'm sure Titus was grateful for that.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.360]   So he's a born-again Gentile convert, left uncircumcised, and he's also very trustworthy
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.880]   most likely because you don't give the funds and a large amount of funds to someone who's
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   not trustworthy, hopefully.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.960]   And so just in 2 Corinthians, the whole chapter on generosity and God loving the cheerful
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   giver and how we're not supposed to give begrudgingly, but just from gratitude and
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.520]   from a cheerful heart, Titus is mentioned in that chapter on two different occasions,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.560]   and he's the one being put in charge for the collection.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.040]   So he is an important figure.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.560]   His origins, when Paul meets him and all of these things, we don't really know.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.720]   In 2 Timothy, he's mentioned, and the only note there is he's gone to Dalmatia, okay?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.400]   But so Titus is a very important person to Paul, and he writes what we would call the
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.000]   pastoral epistles, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus to this man.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.960]   So the book of Titus takes place in Crete.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.000]   Can you guys see this okay?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.120]   So here's Philippi.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.280]   We studied that a couple years ago up here.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.800]   And then you have Thessalonica.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.560]   We studied that during the quarantine in the Macedonian area.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.520]   Galatia, Colossae, Ephesus, and Corinth are kind of all over here, but if you guys see
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.560]   where Crete is, Crete's right here.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.960]   It's kind of like the Australia of the Mediterranean Sea, all right?
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.580]   Just like at the bottom, okay?
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.240]   And there's a reason why I call it the Australia of the Mediterranean.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.160]   It's this little stretch of land, okay?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.760]   So hopefully, just geographically, you're thinking here's the Mediterranean, here's
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.560]   the boot of Italy, and Crete is just kind of in the middle, okay?
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.440]   So Paul actually travels through there, and you'll read about that account in Acts chapter
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   27.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.340]   I'm not going to go into it, but Crete was a very interesting area, okay?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.600]   So here's a couple things that I found on Crete through various commentary sources.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.120]   And I'll tell you, for the preparation for our study, I didn't consult anything, like
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.560]   commentary-wise or online.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.600]   The only thing I consulted online or for commentary work was just for the background of the place,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   okay?
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.920]   So you'll see that you don't need to consult the commentary, and we actually discourage
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.480]   you from going into that right away.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.040]   But anyway, for Crete, you guys might have done your own research.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.260]   Under Tiberius, it was used for exiles from Rome.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:48.700]   If you guys know any British history, Australia was like where they sent the not-so-high-quality
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.700]   characters away.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.420]   I'm not sure if you guys already knew that.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.540]   Yeah, Australia was where they sent them.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.180]   So Crete, during Tiberius' reign, was where they sent all Roman citizens who were a little
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.940]   bit like not-exemplary citizens, okay?
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.520]   So it kind of was an exile, prison-like area.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.100]   So when you have a bunch of colorful characters, you know that that area develops a culture
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.280]   that's not necessarily the most wholesome, okay?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.340]   So there's a strong Jewish community also in Crete.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.780]   You see them in Acts 2 at Pentecost.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.840]   They're there, okay?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.400]   So these guys from Crete are seeing what the apostles are doing, and they marvel.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.720]   And so there's a Jewish community on Crete.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.000]   In the Old Testament, oftentimes it's referred to as Kaphtor.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I don't know how to pronounce that, but I think I'm hopefully a little close.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.960]   And one interesting tidbit is that a lot of them have been archers since birth.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.320]   It's a mountainous area full of forests and trees.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.280]   And so one interesting note is that they know how to fight, and they're very excellent archers,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.680]   and they develop a culture of very vile soldierdom, okay?
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.760]   So that's kind of the culture that Crete has.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.320]   There's a lot of Greek mythology influence.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.540]   Zeus is an important deity on the island of Crete, and they're not a very good people
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.320]   generally.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.300]   So here's a Greek historian writing about Crete, and I highlighted some important words
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   in red.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.880]   "Greed and avarice are so native.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:40.200]   Private seditions, murders, civil wars, steeped in treachery, no policy more inequitable than
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   Crete."
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.560]   So Crete is not a good place.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   And there's a lot of work that Titus has to do on this island.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.220]   There's religious people, there's pagan people, and Titus is given a task, okay?
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.040]   So those are just kind of some of the basic information tidbits that I'm hoping that you
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.280]   guys find somewhat helpful.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   I'm going to break you off into -- well, you're broken off.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.240]   I'm going to just hand you over to your small group leader in a minute, but when you get
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.760]   together, this is what you're going to share, all right?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.360]   Online and your small group leaders probably emailed you some of the homework questions.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.040]   You're going to share your outline of the book of Titus, okay?
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.120]   What did you learn?
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.560]   How did you break it up?
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   What did you notice?
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   Second, what are some major or repeated themes and exhortations that you notice in your reading?
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.320]   Three, you're going to share your one-sentence summary of the epistle, all right?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.560]   Doesn't have to be like super eye-catching, but just your one sentence that'll help you
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.720]   remember, and also that'll help the people in your group just see where you've launched
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.480]   off of.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.960]   And then with the latter part of your time, what I want you guys to do is share the inductive
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.680]   questions.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.360]   And for those of you guys who are kind of newer to our church and you're not quite sure
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.920]   how to do an inductive Bible study, we do have a Bible lab running throughout various
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.320]   parts of the year.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.160]   And so we're not in that right now, but hopefully just during our time together, if you're not
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.800]   quite sure, grab an older member of the church in your small group and maybe spend some time
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.200]   just to get a private tutoring session from said brother or sister, okay?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.380]   But you're going to share inductive questions and observations that you made from these
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.640]   three verses.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.880]   And then at the end, if you have enough time, you're going to share one tangible application
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.800]   that you can make from just the first three verses, okay?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.460]   Something that's measurable, something that's doable.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.760]   You don't want to share an application like, "No God more," okay?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   Because that's not really measurable, all right?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.380]   So what is one tangible application you can make just from the verses one through three?
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.380]   How many...
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   Raise your hand if you've noticed that just the first three verses are super dense.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.860]   It's super dense.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.160]   And that's why in preparation for this, I preached out of this two weeks ago just so
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:15.380]   that a lot of the dense material we cover in the sermon, okay?
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.280]   And then this study is more for you to just go into the outline.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.200]   And then when you have time, you yourself to go into just those first three verses,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   okay?
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.320]   So right now it's 7:37.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.920]   I'm going to give you until 8...
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:38.240]   20-ish, and then I'm going to come up and I'm going to walk you through my outline,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   all right?
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.160]   So if you guys don't know each other, take a couple minutes, don't share your life story,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.120]   get to know each other a little bit, and then just jump right in.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:54.160]   And if you need just blank text only, Titus chapters one through three, I think there
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.840]   are still some in the back.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.720]   All right, enjoy.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:08.000]   All right, we're going to start the discussion time at 8.20, so finish up your...
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.720]   Okay, you guys just finished up all your thoughts.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.280]   It got quite all really fast.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:22.200]   All group leaders, if you guys can pass this worksheet to everybody in your group.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   And basically, I'm going to be sharing with you my homework, all the work that I did in
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.560]   mostly the last three, four days, just putting this together.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:43.680]   And so that hopefully this will kind of give you insight as to how the pastor studies the
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.160]   Bible, okay?
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.040]   So normally on a Wednesday night, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be doing
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.200]   a discussion like this, but I'm only going to come up and do the teaching at the end
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.760]   for about 20 minutes.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.720]   And it's not going to be so much a teaching as it is going to be like a reflection and
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.520]   kind of like a little wrap up.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.080]   Most of the study is going to be all on you guys, okay?
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:16.480]   So we don't want your understanding of the Bible to be pastor-centered or pastor-focused.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.800]   You don't want to say, "Well, Pastor Mark says this, Pastor Nate, Pastor Peter says
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.220]   that, that pastor at that church says this."
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.920]   Everyone has a different interpretation.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   We want you guys to dive into the Word and extract your own...
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   I mean, there is a proper way to do it, but really feed off of the source itself, okay?
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.260]   So this is how I did it.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:47.360]   And the whole process of this for me, I actually started memorizing this thing as soon as I
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   knew we were going to do Titus.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.560]   And my encouragement for memorizing a book, it's actually not that hard.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.680]   We have 17 of our teachers memorizing this so that when they teach it, starting next
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.480]   month to the kindergartners and up, they know the context.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.800]   So I just go one verse a day, and I'm not done yet.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.960]   I'm at verse 6 today, chapter 3, verse 6.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   But I just start memorizing this.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.620]   And I memorized this in the NIV about 15 years ago.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.520]   But as I'm going through the memorization process, I'm meditating on it, I'm chewing
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:30.840]   on it, and I'm starting to notice very similar words, very similar phrases, very similar
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.560]   patterns.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.040]   And so it forces me to just kind of slow down.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   All right?
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.200]   So I came into this having memorized up to chapter 3, verse 6.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.720]   And then what I did was I took this, okay?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.120]   Just the text.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.160]   I took out the chapters.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.980]   I kept the verses in there.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.320]   I take out the chapters.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.980]   And I just start making observations and start writing stuff up on a Word document, okay?
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.520]   And so I copied and pasted onto a Word doc.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.960]   And then I started just kind of indenting things and moving things around just as I
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.380]   chart through the letter.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.280]   And so you have that here.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.480]   So the first thing I did was I indented just everything so that...
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.000]   I mean, the first three verses, we did it today, so I just kind of organized it so I
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.640]   visually can kind of see the thought flow.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.040]   But I made everything else like little sections, okay?
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.940]   So I broke it down, and then I labeled it.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.640]   As you can see, the first part I put "Introduction to Elders and Overseers," and then "Why the
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.720]   Church Needs Godly Leaders," and then "Expectations of Those Who Are Redeemed Under These Godly
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.560]   Leaders," and then "Expectations of the Redeemed, Part Two," and in the middle of that is a
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.960]   little "Why We Should Be Zealous," okay?
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.880]   "Why We Should Be Zealous."
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:12.000]   And so I broke it down like that.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.360]   And then if you notice, like the little teal-colored highlight, I just started highlighting Paul's
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.960]   direct commands to Titus.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   Set in order.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   Appoint.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   Speak.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   Show yourself.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   Speak, exhort, reprove.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   Let no one disregard.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Remind.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   Speak, avoid, reject.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   Help.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.840]   So if Titus is a leader at the church, and whenever he's commanded to do certain things,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.960]   then I'm like, "Okay, these are important things that I need to pay attention to," okay?
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.280]   This is a leader who's supposed to appoint other leaders, so whatever is being directly
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.000]   told to him are very important things for Titus to keep in mind and for all church leaders
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.320]   to keep in mind, so I kind of highlighted that.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.040]   And then I made a chart, okay?
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   If you guys, I don't make charts for like, if we're going through Philippians, you don't
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.160]   have those charts, but in Titus, if you guys notice, you have a lot of good qualities that
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.560]   people are supposed to have and a lot of bad qualities people are supposed to have.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.200]   Nod your heads if you guys already knew that.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   Yeah, so I make a chart, all right?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.480]   And as I'm doing this, I'm making the chart, I'm copying and pasting and adding, copying
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   and pasting and adding as I'm just going through this.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.960]   And this was when I was like at verse 9 of chapter 1, so I just wanted to show you, I
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:49.160]   put it into a category of godliness and then I put it into a category of ungodliness.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.280]   And that just came from just feeling the mood of the letter and the categorizations, not
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.600]   just by reading it, but by just digesting on it for a few months.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.200]   Now obviously, you're not going to have a few months to study a letter at all times,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:11.700]   but the more you slow down, the more you catch very important themes on any book.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.640]   Because when you just read through stuff, you can miss a lot of things, right?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   So I categorized it godliness and ungodliness.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:28.740]   And if you look at the final chart on the third page, I have a list of who's godly,
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:37.720]   what qualifies as godly traits, why they need to be godly, and how they become godly.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.560]   Do you guys see that?
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.920]   And then on the other side, I made an ungodly category.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.480]   Who are these ungodly folks?
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:56.280]   They're men of circumcision, cretins, pre-Christ selves, factious pretenders, and then all
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.720]   of the characterizations of ungodly people.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.600]   So I made a chart, okay?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.760]   And then I made a note of frequently repeated or emphasized traits or words.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   So I noticed that sensible comes out five times.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.720]   Not just if you actually also notice that, okay?
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.280]   ESV says self-control, but sensible.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.040]   I also noticed that good deeds actually wins this competition.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   Came out eight times.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   Do you guys notice that?
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.520]   Raise your hands if you saw that, okay?
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.480]   Good deeds, good deeds, good deeds, good deeds.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   That comes out.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.400]   How about on the other side?
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:46.480]   The thing that comes out negative the most is actually heterodoxy, bad teaching.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.600]   Interesting.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:58.960]   So just from making this list, on the godly side, there's an emphasis on appropriately
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.080]   responding in faith and doing good.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:13.800]   On this side, these dudes, the thing that's emphasized the most is they teach bad theology.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.200]   Interesting.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   What is emphasized?
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.120]   I made this chart, okay?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.200]   So I noticed that sensible comes out a lot.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.440]   Good deeds comes out a lot.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.960]   Contradict sound doctrine comes out the most when it comes to the ungodly people.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:39.680]   And if you guys also noticed, our Savior shows up on every chapter sometimes twice.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.120]   Not just if you notice that.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.320]   After every incarnation, there's our Savior, okay?
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.600]   So why is that?
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.560]   So if I was asking an inductive study, it's like, there's this theme of our Savior repeating
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.400]   through this book.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.640]   Is this significant for the people of Crete?
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.960]   That would be something I would ask.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.560]   What kind of teachings are going around so that Paul's having to speak against the teaching
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560]   so much?
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.520]   Then I would have to look into that.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.040]   What is this relationship between our faith and good deeds?
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.380]   James says faith without deeds is dead, but this is Titus.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.720]   So what is this relationship?
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.560]   How do I make good deeds?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.960]   Because in chapter 3 verse 5, it says good deeds doesn't lead to salvation, but there's
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   an emphasis there.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   What do I do with this?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.560]   So I made this chart.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:46.880]   And then I just went through and highlighted all the reasons that will tell me why something
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.040]   is supposed to be done.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.520]   So that, one of our brothers at the table is like, so that's mentioned a lot.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.440]   Is so that, is that an important phrase in English?
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yeah, okay?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.720]   Eat lunch on time so that there's a why question that's naturally being asked, okay?
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.760]   So every important word that I kind of came across, I just started highlighting in yellow
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.220]   so that my eye would go to these little breaks.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:29.080]   And then I looked at anything that's future focused, the already but not yet tension.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.920]   There's hope, there's eternal life, right?
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.720]   We're looking forward to the appearing.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.940]   So that comes out in every chapter.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.880]   So I marked those in red.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.240]   So I'm hoping that, I mean, it's just the first three chapters.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.080]   The latter two are the verses 1 through 3.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.160]   But I started with this.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.360]   And then I ended up just marking stuff up.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.440]   And if I was doing this for myself and not to present, I would print it at this stage.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.120]   And then I would take a pen and I would start drawing lines everywhere.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.480]   And I'll start X-ing stuff out.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.860]   I would start underlining stuff.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.640]   And the more I just mark this up, and you don't want to do this on your Bible because,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.160]   you know, if you make a mistake, you're done, right?
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.880]   But I just want to mark it up so that I could digest, chew, and like just get every morsel
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.720]   of spiritual nutrient that is supposed to be in there.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   You will get what you put in, right?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.020]   And then at the end, I made some, a note of fun stuff.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.960]   These are things that I'm going to have to stress out a little bit when I teach.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.040]   All right?
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.840]   These are controversial possibly.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.800]   Chapter 1 verse 13, "Reprove them severely, the false prophets, false teachers, so that
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.120]   they may be sound in the faith."
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.240]   Huh.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.600]   Can a false prophet be saved and restored?
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   Huh.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.320]   When you're going against a factious person or a person who's living a compromised life
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:21.960]   and they're teaching bad stuff and you reprove them severely, can you turn them?
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.200]   And how am I supposed to do this?
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.540]   Some of you like to rebuke.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.500]   Some of you hate it.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.760]   But if someone's teaching bad stuff, the word severely is a strong word.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.260]   Okay, there's a lot of stuff I'm going to have to glean from this.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.080]   Another one, chapter 2 verse 5.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.360]   I'm going to look at this side of the room, okay, while I talk about this.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.600]   Young women, be workers at home.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.120]   Woo-hoo.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.120]   That's not going to be fun, or is it?
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.560]   So I'm going to have to be very careful in our cultural context, and most of you guys
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.740]   know I'm pretty sure my worldview is bigger than most everybody because I've traveled
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.760]   a lot.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.720]   Most of the world, this isn't an issue.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:20.120]   But in First World America, Orange County, I'm going to have to deal with this.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.640]   In China, when I was there as a missionary between 2009 and 2012, one thing that kept
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:32.900]   coming up as an issue, which is never an issue here, is can Christians eat blood?
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.000]   Have you guys ever wrestled with that?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.780]   I didn't until I got to China.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.160]   But they were debating about this.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.120]   Some churches actually were on the verge of splitting about this because the pagan Chinese
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.560]   person in their hot pot, in whatever it is, will they eat blood?
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.040]   They will eat blood.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:56.880]   But for a church Christian person, is that okay?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.160]   Those are fun passages that I would have to tackle in China.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.660]   But here, you're like, "Hey, blood, shmud, whatever," right?
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:13.120]   But this one, I'm going to make a note because this is going to be something that I might
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.520]   have to counsel my daughter in as she gets older.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:24.320]   "Hey, Karis, what does it mean for you to honor the Lord in every way?"
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.920]   This is what it says in the Bible.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.160]   What does this mean for you?
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.120]   In First Timothy, it actually says, "Women will be saved through childbearing."
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.920]   Have you guys ever read that passage?
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.580]   What does that mean?
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:41.240]   So there are going to be passages that I have to tackle because they're culturally sensitive
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   buttons.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.960]   Chapter 3, "Remind them to be subject to rulers, to be obedient, to be ready for every good
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   work."
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   When you get to a democracy and you have Christians blasting our national leaders, you have a
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.320]   lot of Christians going at it.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.880]   Do you guys know this?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.760]   So that's going to be something that I need to carefully examine to speak into our times.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   So those are some fun things.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.920]   Chapter 3, verse 9, "Avoid foolish controversies, genealogy, strifes, disputes."
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.000]   What is that today?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.720]   We don't worry about genealogies today.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:23.440]   But we talk about other stuff, things that churched people, Christians, argue over that
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.380]   might end up proving to be unprofitable.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.060]   What are those things?
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.240]   So I'll make a note.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.680]   Could it be some of the political agenda-related kind of stuff now that we're constantly engaging
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.040]   in?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.800]   Is that something that can be categorized in here?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.600]   I'll put that in there because it can affect my understanding of Christian good deeds,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   right?
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.080]   Hot button items.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.800]   Warn a factious person once, warn them a second time, after that have nothing to do with them.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.520]   You know how hard that is to do?
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.840]   There are churches that love to discipline people.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.100]   Nod your heads if you knew that there are churches out there that love to make examples
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   of people.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.640]   Yeah, we're not like that.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.760]   We don't want to do that.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.120]   We want to make sure everyone is loved on and truth is spoken to them in love.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   The last thing we want for them is to be made a public spectacle to be kicked out of the
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   church.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.360]   What kind of a person do you have to kick out of the church?
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.280]   A factious one.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.000]   So that's another hot button item that I'm going to have to address when we get there,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   right?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.100]   What does it mean to be factious?
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.920]   Some of you guys have strong opinions.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   Are you factious?
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.800]   Did I hear something like a yes?
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.040]   So these are, when I'm going through this and as I'm just meditating through all of
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.240]   these things, I'm tripping over things that I'm going, "Does this apply to my life?
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.640]   Does this apply to Irvine?
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.400]   Does this apply to our church?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:10.480]   And if so, how do I teach this in a way that's both sensitive, faithful to the truth, and
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.920]   yet looking to build up and if need be, reprove sharply?"
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.640]   So these are things that I go through as I look through the passage.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.880]   And in my sermon on two Sundays ago, I mentioned like, "Hard work doesn't make me godly."
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   You guys remember that?
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.560]   I was like, "Hard work doesn't make me godly.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.060]   It just corrupts me even more."
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.080]   First service, I actually tied it very beautifully together saying like, "So we work hard in
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.400]   response."
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.240]   But second service, I forgot, so I left people hanging.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.920]   So does that mean just leave, I could be lazy?
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   No, okay?
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.240]   Work hard, because that's what Titus is pointing at, right?
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.800]   But this is what something that comes up, good deeds, there's an importance placed on
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.560]   good deeds.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.600]   Godliness doesn't come through man's effort, but redeemed man gives every effort to reflect
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.320]   the glory of his Redeemer.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.440]   That's a theme in the book of Titus.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.160]   You guys notice this?
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.200]   Okay?
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.400]   First Corinthians 9.24 and 9.27 talking about buffeting his body.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   Buffeting as to win, right?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.200]   Taking off whatever is hindering, I'm taking off to win.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.760]   Philippians 2.12.13, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.240]   works in you to work out all things."
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:36.800]   So like, there's a juxtaposition of my hard work, but God doing the work to sanctify me
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.160]   and to produce good deeds in me.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.340]   So there's a theological like emotional, or sorry, not emotional, but like a theological
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.480]   constipation in my head.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   Like, I don't know what to do with this.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.880]   I'm supposed to work hard, but my hard work doesn't make me Godlier, but I need to work
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.160]   hard in response.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.440]   Okay?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   But what does that mean?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.680]   So I'm looking at like 1 Peter 1.16, "Be holy for I am holy."
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.320]   2 Timothy 2.15, "Be diligent to present yourself as a worker approved by God, unashamed."
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.260]   4.7, "I have fought the good fight."
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:13.920]   So hard work is absolutely essential to the Christian.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:22.240]   "Laying aside every encumbrance, you're running full speed ahead to bear good fruit for the
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.760]   Lord, but the irony is it's not you."
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:33.400]   Titus has a lot to say of the connection between faith and deeds.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.320]   And hopefully just as you guys are looking through this, you'll notice that.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.480]   Okay?
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.760]   Is correct doctrine important?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   Yes or no?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.120]   Absolutely.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.200]   Hard work, yes.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.080]   Important or not?
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.520]   Absolutely important.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.140]   And what's more important?
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.740]   What leads to the other?
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.460]   So these are the things you're going to have to wrestle through in the text.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:03.200]   So how I do the inductive study, I usually have five translations.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   NIV is my like most dynamic one where you get a lot of interpretation in the NIV.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.500]   Okay?
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.080]   And then I have the NAS and the ESV.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.540]   I have a newer translation called the Legacy Standard, and then I have the King James.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.940]   And I just kind of do an eyeball scan through all of them.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:29.820]   And if there are translations that all look a little bit different, I ask a question.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.020]   Why are these so differently translated?
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:39.640]   Is there something in the original language that makes it very tricky to translate properly?
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.820]   So I'm asking these questions.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.200]   What does "for the faith" mean?
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.480]   Can the non-elect have faith?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.500]   Can the non-elect have knowledge of the truth?
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.060]   What is the knowledge of the truth?
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.560]   What is truth referring to here?
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.280]   What is the relationship of knowledge of the truth and godliness?
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.120]   And as I'm doing these things as a pastor, they come out in the sermon.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   So as a pastor going through a text, the better the questions that I ask, the clearer a lot
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.520]   of times my presentation will be.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   Okay?
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.440]   And so the more you ask very important questions and you slow down enough, you can gain more
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.600]   insight into this passage.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.200]   And I already went through chapters 1 through 3 on the sermon, so I'm not going to cover
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   it.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   It's pretty meaty.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   Okay?
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.680]   So that's hopefully something that you were wrestling through in your small group.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:39.960]   Verse 2, so God who never lies, God who cannot lie, God who does not lie, they all have a
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.160]   little bit of a different nuance, right?
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.120]   So these are the kinds of questions that I ask.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.140]   What is verse 1's connection with the hope that is mentioned in verse 2?
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.600]   What does Paul mean when he says eternal life?
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.240]   The NASB says God cannot lie, whereas the other translations differ.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.260]   What is the original word and its meaning?
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.040]   Is this promise recorded somewhere in Genesis?
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.480]   Before the beginning of time, when did God create time?
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.920]   Chapter 1, verse 1.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.240]   There was a promise made before that?
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.320]   So these are questions that my mind will naturally go to, okay?
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.520]   And many of my questions are not answerable, I find, okay?
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.080]   But they're good to ask so that you slow down enough to just process through.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.560]   And then, so what I would do is if I have a good Bible resource and the translations
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.400]   all kind of point to a slightly different understanding or meaning, then I'll look at
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.420]   a Bible dictionary and I'll do a little bit of a bigger comparison.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:44.480]   So that's my process as I look through the whole thing and then I go verse by verse.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.860]   And what I want to leave you with is, as I was doing this, I noticed three things that
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.280]   were very similar in pattern, okay?
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:05.500]   Chapter 1, verses 1 and 2, there's a future discussion and there's something that happens
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:11.520]   and that's been given to the believer, and there's God our Savior.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:17.760]   And then chapter 2, verse 11 to 15, very similar theme.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.720]   Chapter 3, verses 4 through 8, a very similar theme.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.320]   So I just copied and pasted and I put it in like one little file so that I could look
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.160]   at it and stare at it, and I noticed that there's a pattern here.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.800]   Paul is talking about the hope of eternal life, okay?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.960]   In chapter 2, he talks about blessed hope.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.640]   Chapter 3, heirs to the hope of eternal life.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:56.800]   And all of that has come across through the incarnation of Jesus, manifested, appeared,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.520]   appeared.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:04.840]   And an attribute of God, a characteristic of God has showed itself to man, truthfulness
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:11.260]   of God, grace of God, kindness and love of God.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:19.840]   And there's an expected response in the life of the believer, faith and godliness, sensible,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.720]   righteous, godly lives, regenerated, renewed, justified.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.360]   And with each section, there's a discussion on God being our Savior.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:39.440]   So when you spend time just going through just the whole of the book, slowed down, and
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.360]   you just start making notes, you start seeing what you're going to be looking for in the
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.320]   next three months.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.200]   You start already making little like ticks as to like, "Okay, when I get to chapter
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.840]   2 verse 5, I'm going to slow down and I'm going to really dive into that passage."
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:01.440]   Especially since maybe the moms around me are either their stay-at-home moms or moms
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.840]   around me are working moms.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.400]   What is God's desire?
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.200]   That can be a very sensitive thing.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.400]   How do I process through this?
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.680]   When I'm looking at chapter 3 verse 1 and we're talking about authorities and rulers,
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:25.840]   how am I supposed to, as a Christian in the face of a very wicked national leadership,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.980]   am I supposed to voice my opinion or am I supposed to quietly in a docile way just keep
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.560]   my mouth shut?
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:41.320]   What is the Bible saying about how I am to live out my godly life and what kind of good
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.200]   deeds I'm supposed to be producing in my life?
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.360]   So these are all things that come about as you're diving in.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.020]   Okay?
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.120]   So hopefully the next three, four months, now we're going to slow down and we're going
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:03.080]   to take it like three verses at a time, prove to be very beneficial for you.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.200]   The more you dive in, the more you'll get out.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.920]   And every week when you come, you're not coming to learn, you're coming to share what you've
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   learned.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.160]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.600]   You're not coming to just, "Here, feed me."
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   That will happen, but your primary reason for coming is, "Let me share with you the
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:35.000]   things that I've gleaned as I've poured into this passage, as I've combed through the words,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.560]   and hey, what you're sharing really is benefiting me.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.520]   And hopefully what I'm sharing is stimulating you too toward loving good deeds."
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:50.440]   And so that's why we're getting together, not to hear a sermon, but to just come and
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:56.720]   fellowship through the study of His living and active in that word.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   Amen?
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:04.760]   So next week, so starting next week, you're not going to have me talking too much.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.720]   We're going to do praise, and then you're going to go into about an hour of small group
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   time.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:16.420]   And here's the thing, human nature, if you didn't do the work, if you didn't prepare,
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.280]   that hour is going to be torture.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:26.420]   You're not going to want to come and be the only like, "I didn't do my lesson this week."
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.900]   And you're going to have nothing to share.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:39.120]   Come anyway, but I guarantee you, you put in the time, you will be excited to talk.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.160]   You'll be excited to share.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.920]   Where an hour goes by and you're like, "Wait, PPC, give us another 15 minutes."
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.840]   That's what we're hoping happens.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   Okay?
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.220]   But you will get in what you...you will get out what you put in.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.200]   So next week, it's an awkward division.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.020]   Four through six is a little bit kind of like it breaks the elder and overseer little category,
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.300]   but I did that on like...I had no choice because it was either overview and then verse one
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:11.340]   through three and like four through nine, or just kind of bite-sized pieces.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   So know that.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.860]   I already know that the division is kind of funky for chapter one.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:16.860]   All right?
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.000]   So four through six is what you're going to be looking at.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.980]   And take time to just ask as many inductive questions of these verses, and then come up
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.140]   with observations.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.760]   Now that you've actually looked at the whole book, how do these verses fit into the context
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.460]   of the rest of the section, the rest of the chapter, and the rest of the letter?
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:45.400]   And then number four, write down some practical and measurable applications you can draw from
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.600]   these verses.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.820]   And then come ready to share.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.060]   And that's what we're going to be doing.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.060]   And I'm just going to come up for 15 minutes and do a little wrap-up or address something
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.700]   that is a little bit tricky.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.940]   And that's going to be every week.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.940]   Okay?
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.480]   So I'm going to just wrap us up in prayer, and then you're going to spend time in your
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:09.100]   small group just praying for each other, praying for our time of study together, even organizing
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.780]   like, "Hey, it looks like you're new and you're not quite sure exactly how to go about preparing
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.780]   this thing.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   Hey, let's grab dinner.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.700]   Let's do this together."
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:25.180]   If you see somebody in your group who's newer, who's learning how to do this, hey, meet before
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180]   and prepare.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.420]   We're here all day on Wednesday.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:33.960]   So you guys can come and grab dinner and then prepare it, finalize it together if you want.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.780]   But whatever it is that you can do to help each other, by all means do it.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.300]   And don't rely on your small group leader to do it.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:47.220]   Like everybody in the small group, help each other prepare and pray for each other.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.700]   And then we'll see you next week.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.780]   So let me pray, and then for the rest of the time, for the next 15, 20 minutes, pray in
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.620]   your small group, and then we'll call it an evening.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.620]   All right?
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.780]   Let's pray together.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:12.220]   Father, we are very thankful that you provide for us this evening just to study, to learn,
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.020]   to discuss, to share.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.940]   And I pray, Father, that more than anything else, that you would grow in us a greater
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:26.220]   hunger to know you, just a greater appetite to know your heart, just a greater longing
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.100]   to be good stewards of your word.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:35.700]   And I pray that you would empower each and every individual in this room really to discipline
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:42.020]   ourselves with our time to put in to cooking ourselves a great meal so that when we get
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:47.020]   together for this spiritual potluck, we'll really have a lot to share so that it would
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.420]   be just a joyful experience for all of us who are involved.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:57.180]   I pray that you would give us insight, help us to draw near to you as we study.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:02.260]   And Lord, would you reveal your heart to your people so that we can respond appropriately
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.700]   and give you the glory that you do.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.700]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   Amen.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:05.700]   Amen.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.700]   Amen.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   Amen.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.700]   Amen.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:30.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
