[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Well, good morning, church.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   Can you guys do me a favor?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   We haven't done this in a while.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   It's not that we're loosening up restrictions.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.480]   But can you look at the person next to you
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   and just give them kind of like a cool--
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   right?
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   Smile with your eyes.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   They can't see your mouth.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   And just do a little hello.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   Let's break a little bit of ice.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   We haven't done that in a long time.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   It feels very, very good.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   If you guys have your apps out, let's
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   look at a few announcements before we
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   continue with our service.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   Starting next week, we're going to have another round
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.480]   of membership classes going on.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   And if you guys don't already know this,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   we recently got the keys to a new building.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   So we are owners of that building across the way.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   And the membership class, which was previously
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   held upstairs in the education department,
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   is now going to be on the other side.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   So if you guys want to take a look and see what's there,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   by all means, everything is open.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   And soon enough, we're going to have the cafe services
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   and things up and running as well.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   So membership class is for people
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   who have the intent of becoming members at Marine Community
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   Church.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   It's 9 to 1020 every Sunday for the course of about eight
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   weeks.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   OK?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   If you are a college student, you guys probably
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   already know that there is a seminar coming up
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   on April 17 on just biblical gender roles.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   And that's going to be from 10 to 12.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   If you're not a college student, I
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   would encourage you guys to just pray for that time.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   There's a lot of confusion just in our world,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   and especially on our college campuses.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   So that's going to be happening about five Saturdays from now.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   On May 22, we have a woman's fellowship.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.480]   It's called a woman's film-o-ship,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   not because they're watching anything,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   but they're going to be listening to an audio recording
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   and just having a good time of discussion and fellowship.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   So if you are a lady and you are interested, please do.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   Look at the information there and sign up.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   And if you have any questions, contact Carrie.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   OK?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   This is a very important announcement for you guys
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   who are members of our church.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   On April 25, we are going to have our quarterly members
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.480]   meeting.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.480]   And it is mandatory.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   But we're not quite ready to meet physically yet.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   So it is going to be all online.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   So please do your best to prioritize that and to log on.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   And the information will be forthcoming
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   once the day gets closer.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   I don't know if you guys are aware,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   but tomorrow is Berean Community Church's 24th anniversary.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   So April 12, 1997 was when the church got launched
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480]   and got started.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   And tomorrow is our anniversary.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   And so just kind of in lieu of the new building that we got
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   and also just to kind of reflect on God's faithfulness
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.480]   over the last near decade and a half, the leaders yesterday,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.480]   we actually sat around for a couple hours just putting
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   together a podcast of the history of the church.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   And most of us have been here almost the whole two decades
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   or so.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   And so it'll be a good time for you guys
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   if you're interested in learning more about how this church got
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   started, how it kept going despite difficulty
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   and challenges.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   And it's about an hour and 49 minutes,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   but there is a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   So it's on the Facebook page.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   So if you guys want to log on to that and check it out,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   by all means, please do so.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   We're going to have our sister Sydney being baptized today.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   So after our pray is set, she's going to come up
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   and share her testimony, and she's going to be baptized.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   And so my encouragement is as you're listening
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   to her testimony, the story of how God's been working
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   in her life, that you also pray as you listen
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   that God really would not just use her testimony to bless us
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   today, but her change to life, that her life would
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   be useful in just bearing much fruit for the kingdom.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   And so Sydney's going to be sharing her testimony,
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.480]   and then we're going to have a time of the word.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   So if you've prepared an offering, if it's physical,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   we have a box in the back.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   But if not, I will give you an opportunity
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   to just submit that electronically,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   and then our praise team is going to lead us in praise.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.480]   But let me pray for us, and then we'll continue.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   Father, we confess that everything that we have
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   is from you, and you are the Father of lights.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   You do not change.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.480]   And every good thing that we've been given, you've provided.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   And so we come this morning wanting to say thank you,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   not just with our words, but just with our gifts
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   and offerings.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   And we want to ask, Father, for just great joy as we give.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   And I pray that you would use it, whatever is collected,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   really building up of your kingdom.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   And so we thank you for this morning.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   We pray for your blessing over our time,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   and we ask these things in Jesus' name.

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   Hi, my name is Sydney Bellamy.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   I'm currently a first year attending UCI,
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   and this is my testimony.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   I've grown up in a Christian home my entire life.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   Both my parents are Christian,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   so they raised my brother and I up in the church.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   We would go to church every Sunday,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   and even though this was a weekly part of my entire life,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   I didn't really go out of a love for Christ.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   Growing up, I just thought this was something you always do,
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   and I honestly was just going through the motions when I went.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   I became a Christian in fifth grade.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   I did believe that Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.480]   died and was resurrected for the forgiveness of my sins,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.480]   but my reasoning was entirely selfish.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   I didn't want to become a Christian
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   because I wanted to surrender my life
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   and be reconciled with God.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   Truthfully, I just didn't want to go to hell when I died.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   As you'd think, no change in my life occurred
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   after becoming a Christian.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   By the time middle school rolled around,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   my friend invited me to youth group.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   I started going because it seemed like the right thing to do,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   but I still didn't have any burning desire
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   to get to know the Lord.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   But I kept going, and I actually started to have an interest
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   in church and in God.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   In eighth grade, I went to winter camp for the first time,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   and it was in that time that I realized
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   I never really surrendered my life to Christ.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   I continued to get to know him as such a gracious
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   and loving father, and I wanted to be his child.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   For a while, I thought that was when I became a Christian
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.480]   on the last night of camp,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   when they had a call to altar moment.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   But after we came down the mountain,
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   that Jesus high just wore off,
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   and life reverted right back to the way it was.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   And even though I wasn't in the bad crowd
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   or living a rebellious life in my worldly eyes,
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   I certainly wasn't living a life for Christ.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   After middle school, my family and I started trying out
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   different churches.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   The summer right before my sophomore year of high school,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   we settled on a new church.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.480]   By the end of summer, I finally started going
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   to the high school group,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   but I was extremely nervous and timid.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   I started going to Bible study with the girls in my class
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   once school began, and I instantly clicked
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   with these girls, and for the first time,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   found a community that seemed to love Jesus,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   and I learned how personal a relationship with God is.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   It was then that I reflected on my own life
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   and realized that's not enough to just know
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   that I'm a sinner and believe that Jesus died
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   on the cross for my sins,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   and that I'm made new because of it.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   I needed to make a 180 degree turn in my life
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   and live for Christ and be an image and reflection of him,
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   not of this broken world.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   I started going to church not out of obligation,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   but with a heart that wanted to know God
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   so that I could grow deeper in a relationship with him.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   Slowly but surely, when it came to doing my Bible study,
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   I actually had a desire to do so
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   and learn more about who this holy God is.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.480]   I desired to show others not just through my words,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   but also through my actions,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   that my heart and life belonged to God,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   and I realized that there was no way for God
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   to work through me without working in me first,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   and that I had to die to myself, serving in defiant flesh
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   so that I could be born again through the Lord
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   and be his obedient servant and vessel for his word.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   I can't really pinpoint an exact time when I was saved,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   but I know that I was saved sometime in high school.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   At the church that I was currently attending,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   they did baptisms in a way that was very showy,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   and it didn't seem right in my heart to do it there,
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.480]   as it was much more man-centered rather than God-centered.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   I think for all this time that I've waited,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   I also just wanted to make sure I did it with pure intentions,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   not just because everyone else had been baptized.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   I've realized what an absolute joy it is to get baptized
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.480]   and make that public declaration
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   that Jesus is my king and Lord of my life.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   I can see clearly in hindsight how faithful God was
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480]   and continues to be in my life,
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   despite my endless shortcomings.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   By the grace of God alone,
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   my walk with Christ has continued to strengthen
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   as I try to keep my eyes fixed on him.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.480]   Going off to college and coming to Berean
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   has been such a blessing in my life,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   as my faith is challenged more than it ever has been.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   But I'm so incredibly thankful for that
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   and all that I've learned,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   constantly trying to examine my heart
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   and intentions by hand, every word, action, and thought.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   I've learned how everything in this life
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   is meaningless outside of God
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   and how having an eternal perspective on life is imperative.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   Despite my stubborn and selfish heart
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   wanting to live for myself over all those years,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   he ran after me with a jealousy and compassion
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.480]   that is unmatched.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   I'm eternally grateful that he did
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   because I now know the permanent joy
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   that is found in living for him,
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   forgiven of my sins and walking humbly before him.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   I love Romans 5, verses one and two, that say,
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   "Therefore, having been justified by faith,
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   "we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   "through whom also we have obtained our introduction
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   "by faith into this grace in which we stand,
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   "and we exult in hope of the glory of God."
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   It's so humbling and overwhelmingly comforting
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   to know that there's not a single thing
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   I could ever do to deserve salvation,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   yet God still chose to give me this gift of eternity
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   in relationship with him.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   Though I was dead in my trespasses, he has given me life.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   He is the only good in me,
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.480]   and I will continue to run this race
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   with my eyes fixed on Christ
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   so that I may glorify him with my life.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   Thank you.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   (audience applauds)
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.480]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   (audience member speaks off mic)
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   (audience applauds)
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   - Sidney, thank you for your testimony.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   I'm sure a lot of that resonates with a lot of people
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   who have similar testimonies,
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   and every time you hear a testimony of a changed life,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   it kind of reminds us just to be grateful
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   that really it's not something that we've attained.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   It's something that we've been given.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   So praise God for Sidney's testimony.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   If you guys have your Bibles with you,
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   please turn with me to 2 Peter,
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   and I'm gonna read just the first four verses
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   of 2 Peter, and it'll be projected up overhead.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   So take a minute, or take a second,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   to go to 2 Peter, verses one through four.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   "Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   "to those who have received a faith
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   "of the same kind as ours,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   "by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   "grace and peace be multiplied to you
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   "in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   "seeing that his divine power has granted to us
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   "everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   "Through the true knowledge of him
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   "who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   "For by these he has granted to us
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   "his precious and magnificent promises,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   "so that by them you may become partakers
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   "of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   "that is in the world by lust."
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   Let's pray together.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Lord, would you speak and feed your people this morning,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   and that we would become just all the more appreciative
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   of our lives in Christ,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   and Lord, that that appreciation would overflow
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   into lives that shine brightly for you and for your kingdom.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   Help us to receive your word,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   to be challenged by it, to be changed by it,
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.480]   and help us to grow more and more just hungry
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.480]   to feed more each and every week.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   So we thank you for giving us the opportunity
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   to gather today.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   We pray just for your grace and your blessings
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   over our time together.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   So well, first off, I just wanna say thank you
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   to my church family for praying for us
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   and loving on me and my wife and the kids,
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   especially over the past 14 months.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   By the grace and kindness of God
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   and the support and love of the church,
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   I am completely cancer-free.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   I was diagnosed, for those of you guys who are visiting,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   with stage 3C colorectal cancer back in December 2019,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   and now I'm done with all my treatments.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   And as most of you guys do know,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   the last step of the treatments was a couple weeks ago
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   at the end of February,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   and I took most of March off just to recover and rest,
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   but now I'm back, fully healthy,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   running around pretending to be busy.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   Actually, no, I am busy, but I'm trying to look the part.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.480]   God's answered many of your prayers in the affirmative,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   and I'm much indebted to this church family
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.480]   for all the love and the care.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   We literally had like 14 months straight
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   of a minimum of two meals delivered to our home.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   I received, at the very least,
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   one physical snail mail letter written
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   just to encourage me, to say and remind me
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   that people are praying,
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   and that's not even including all the texts
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.480]   and the emails and stuff, and so, thank you.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   It's been a good year.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   And one of the strangely wonderful things about cancer
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   is that you come face-to-face with your mortality.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.480]   And I don't say like wonderful facetiously
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   because there are aspects of it that are horrible,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.480]   but being reminded that you might possibly die very soon
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   is spiritually a very powerful thing.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.480]   I'm in my 40s, and normally in your 40s,
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   you don't think about death too much.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   But I remember we've had quite a few funerals
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   of our church family members, families,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   just over the course of this year,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   and I remember at one of the first ones,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   shortly after my diagnosis, just watching the casket,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   singing the hymn with the deceased persons,
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   like family and friends,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   and I actually was imagining my body being lowered
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   into the casket, and it wasn't like
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   a morbid, depressing thought.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.480]   It was the first time I had that thought,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   but it was actually rather like a sober reflection
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.480]   on my reality.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   So that reflection caused me to just want to
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   just live better, to be better,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   and with the remainder of my time.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   And because of the size of the tumor
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   and the staging of my cancer,
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   those first few days, I was bracing for the worst,
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   and I had a lot of time, especially those first few days,
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   to think about death.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   I had a lot of time to think about
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   the remainder of my life,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   and I was forced to think through
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   how I would live my life if I had like a year remaining.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   If my end was near,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   how would I maximize the time I had left?
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   What would I emphasize to my kids?
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   What would I preach to you?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   What would I be so eager to press upon
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.480]   those closest to me?
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   So with death on my mind,
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   there was a sense of urgency with which
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   I wanted to live my life,
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   and there were many things that I felt so compelled
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   to share, to preach, and to communicate.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   For the Apostle Peter, it wasn't cancer,
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.480]   but rather his trial and his looming execution.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   He knew he didn't have much time left,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   and I'm going to read verse 14 and 15
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   of the beginning of the epistle for you.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   "Knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   "is imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   "has made clear to me,
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   "and I will also be diligent that at any time
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   "after my departure you will be able
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   "to call these things to mind."
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   So Peter's writing as he's nearing the end of his life.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   He knows that he will soon return home
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   to be with his Lord.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   He knows his time is almost up,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   so he's writing with urgency,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   and he wants to make absolutely crystal clear
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   how he wants the church to carry on
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   this gospel ministry baton after he's gone.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   So he wants them to know what to prioritize.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   He wants them to know what to fight for.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   He wants them to know how to fight,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   what kind of things to abstain from,
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   and he makes very clear in 2 Peter
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   the priorities of the church
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   and the priorities of his saints.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   And he tells the churches to be very careful.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   He explicitly points out that the looming dangers,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   what they are that threaten the church,
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   and he reminds them of the fact
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   that this corrupted world
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   and all that is in this corrupted world
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   will be utterly destroyed by fire.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   So 2 Peter is very intense.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   It's actually probably one of the most intense
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   books of the New Testament.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.480]   So in 61, very intense verses,
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   the apostle Peter gives what appears
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   to be his last will and testament
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   to his spiritual children.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   And so much of what Peter wrote
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   to the churches in Asia Minor
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   and in this second epistle,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   they do apply to us as well.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   So we're going to take a look at that.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   So this morning, I'm going to take a look
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   at primarily the first four verses
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   found in the introduction,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.480]   and then I will walk you through
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   some of the major themes
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.480]   of the whole of 2 Peter
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   because the contents of the entire letter
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   are weighty, they're intense,
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   and of supreme importance.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   So I'm going to give you an outline up front.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480]   Who we are.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   So Peter first says,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   "This is who we are.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   "This is our identity."
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   And then he continues to,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   "What we have been given,"
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   verses two to four.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   And third, "What kind of people we ought to be."
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   So who we are, what we've been given,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   and what kind of people we ought to be,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   especially in the light of the fact
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   that everything is going to crash and burn.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   Okay?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   So who we are,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480]   or in our context,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   who the Apostle Peter is
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   and who he's addressing.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   So it says in verse one,
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   "Simon Peter, a bondservant
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   "and apostle of Jesus Christ."
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   So the letter opens with the apostle
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   introducing himself as Simeon Peter.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   Simeon is a Hebrew form of Simon.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   If you guys are using the ESV,
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   that's not a typo.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   There is an E in there.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   The ESV actually has translated it correctly,
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   while the NASB did not.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.480]   So one point for the ESV.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.480]   Okay?
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   Simeon Peter, so he calls himself
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   a bondservant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   And bondservant is a very nice way
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   of saying slave.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   And the word slave in our modern context
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   is very negative, very incendiary,
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   and it carries a lot of baggage.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   So because it carries so much baggage,
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   most English translations,
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   they use a more neutral feeling bondservant.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   But the word doulos really does mean slave.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   One whose sole purpose is to obey his master
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   and to be useful to his master.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   So in a worldly sense,
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.480]   the word slave feels super offensive
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   and insulting,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   because no one likes to think
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   that he only exists to be used.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   In a worldly sense, it's offensive.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   But I wonder how different the word slave
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   would feel if history was full of examples
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   of selfless, sacrificial, compassionate,
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   generous, protective, and loving slave masters.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.480]   I mean, which we don't have much of, right?
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   But if a slave had a master
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.480]   who was always looking out for his good,
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.480]   I think there would be many volunteer slaves.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   Right?
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   And actually, that's our reality.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   We serve a good shepherd,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   a good master,
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   one who would even elevate us slaves
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   to the level of friend, brother, co-worker,
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   and even co-heir.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Okay, so spiritually,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   slave of Jesus Christ
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   is not a position of humiliation,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   but one of honor.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   Why?
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.480]   Because the master is good.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   So you and I also are slaves.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   Okay, so here's what Peter is saying
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   when he's saying that he's a doulos of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.480]   First, he is inalienably possessed by Jesus Christ.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   So he is a possession.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   He is owned.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   Second, Peter says he's unqualifiedly
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   at the disposal of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   So he has been created
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   and called to be used and to be useful.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   Third, owing and unquestioning obedience
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   to Jesus Christ.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   If Christ commands, he does.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   No questions asked.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   Christ is Savior and God.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   He is creator.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   Peter is creation.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.480]   Okay, so and fourthly,
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   when Peter says, "I am a doulos of Christ,"
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   he's saying he's constantly in the service of Christ.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   So Peter gets no breaks, no holidays, no PTO.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   All right, so he is permanently indentured.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   And the apostle Peter is calling himself
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   a slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   And that title for him is good
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   because Jesus Christ is supremely good.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   Christ is Peter's master and Lord.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   Peter is a slave and a mouthpiece of his good Lord.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.480]   His life is meaningless outside of Christ.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   His sole purpose in this life is to honor Christ.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   And this purpose costs Peter everything.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   But actually, if you read through 1 and 2 Peter,
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   there is absolutely no hint of bitterness,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   regret, insecurity, or shame.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   He does not care that following Christ
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   has cost him everything.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   He is a slave and messenger of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.480]   Christ has been and will continue to be his Lord
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   for all eternity.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.480]   So Simeon, Peter, a bondservant
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   and an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   Slave and apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   And after introducing himself in the letter,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   Peter turns his attention to the audience.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   It reads, "To those who have received a faith
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   of the same kind as ours,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   by the righteousness of our God and Savior,
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   Jesus Christ."
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   So he's addressing this letter
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   to all the other fellow slaves
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   who, like him, have been purchased
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   at a very expensive price,
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   So 2 Corinthians 5:21,
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   "He made him who knew no sin
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   be sin on our behalf
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   so that we might become
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   the righteousness of God in him."
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   So the believers in the churches of Asia Minor
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   had received the same faith.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   They had received,
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   they had responded in the same way
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   to the gospel of Jesus.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   They who were poor were made rich
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   because of the voluntary poverty of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   And though they weren't especially called to be apostles,
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   these Christians, their faith in Christ
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   made them bond servants of Christ,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.480]   just like Peter.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   We too are bond servants.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   We too are slaves.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   Jesus Christ cannot be Savior only
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   and not Lord.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Does this make sense?
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   Jesus Christ cannot be our Savior only
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   and not Lord.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.480]   He is not the means to our goals.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.480]   Pleasing him is our goal.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   We are his means.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   And I'm hoping you're tracking along.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   And Peter's call and burden
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   is our call and burden.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   Peter's master and Lord
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   is our master and Lord.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.480]   And this is the identity of every person
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   who would call himself a Christian.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480]   And you cannot land,
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   you cannot but land on that conclusion
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   if you're reading through the scriptures.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   You cannot accept Christ as Savior
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   and reject him as Lord over your life.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   Are you guys tracking along?
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   Okay.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   Why do you call me Lord?
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   Lord, and do not do what I say.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   Luke 6, 46.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   Words of Jesus.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   So has your soul been purchased
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   by the precious blood of Christ?
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   Have you been restored to your Creator?
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   Have you become in him
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   the righteousness of God?
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   If Jesus is your Lord,
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   you have no rights.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   I'll say that again.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   If Jesus is your Lord,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   you have zero rights.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   You have no purpose outside of Christ.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   And your primary and chief aim in life
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   is to proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   who calls you out of darkness
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   and into his wonderful light.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   Okay?
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   So this is your identity.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   This is my identity.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   This is who we are.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   We are douloi of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   Amen?
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   All right.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   So you and I exist
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   to serve our Lord and Savior,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   Jesus Christ.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   And it's very good this morning
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   to be first reminded of this truth
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.480]   because modern-day church culture
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   kind of nudges us to think
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   that Jesus Christ exists to serve us.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   And we need to make something very clear.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   It's the other way around.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   All right?
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   So who are we?
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   We are bond servants of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   And may he do with us as he deems fit.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   Amen?
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   So this brings us to our second point,
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   what we have been given.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   So for the who we are part of the sermon outline,
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   it's all there in verse 1.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   So it's not hard to catch.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   All right?
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   But the what we have been given part,
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   it's a little bit more challenging
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   because we have to look at all the verses
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   from--or 2 through 4.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   So I'm going to reread verses 2 to 4 for you.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   "Grace and peace be multiplied to you
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   seeing that his divine power has granted to us
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   everything pertaining to life and godliness
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   through the true knowledge of him who called us
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   by his own glory and excellence.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   For by these he has granted to us
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   his precious and magnificent promises,
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   so that by them you may become partakers
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   that is in the world by lust."
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   So in the Greek, there's grammatical awkwardness
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   all over the place in these three verses.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.480]   And in the Greek, in the new section,
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   is clearly starting at verse 3,
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   but Peter has let the grammar flow from verse 2.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   And there's also no main verb in these verses.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   And Peter goes back and forth from you to us,
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   us to you, you to us.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   So if you're doing like an inductive Bible study
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   through these verses, you would come up
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.480]   with a lot of grammatical questions.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   And the English translations have smoothed out
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   things a little bit in these verses,
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   so they read easier.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   But if you compare all the English translations,
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   there's commas and semicolons and periods
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   in different places.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.480]   So the grammar is a little awkward and complex.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   But syntactically, there are two things
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.480]   that are highlighted in these verses,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   and they come after the words "has granted to us."
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   "Has granted to us."
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   First, the term "everything" is in the emphatic position.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   So Peter is stressing and emphasizing how
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   God's divine power has granted to all believers
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   everything they need.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   And everything pertaining to what?
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   To life and godliness.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.480]   So you can actually interpret that as a godly life,
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   and that would not be incorrect.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   So there are a lot of little couplets in 2 Peter
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   where two words are used to kind of describe one idea.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   And this couplet is the first one.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   Life and godliness or godly life.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   So God has given to the apostles,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   to the churches in Asia Minor,
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   and to all of us who know him,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   everything we need for life and for godliness.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   And everything we need for a godly life.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   So what is Peter saying?
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   You lack nothing.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   You want to know God?
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   You want to please God?
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   You want to lead others to God?
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   And that's consistent with what we see all over the scriptures,
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   and this is nothing new.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   So the apostle Paul points to us, to this truth,
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.480]   that God's grace is sufficient.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   2 Corinthians 12.9.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   That he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   Philippians 4.13.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   In Psalm 23, what does King David say?
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   He says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   I shall not want."
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   I like how the NIV translated it.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   I lack nothing."
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.480]   Okay, so hopefully this isn't new teaching for you.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   Hopefully this has been and is familiar biblical truth for you.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   Okay, let me repeat that.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   You have everything you need.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   And we sing about this all the time, right?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   We sang about it just 15 minutes ago.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   Your grace is enough.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.480]   Your grace is enough.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   Your grace is enough for me, right?
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   And hopefully when you sang it, you weren't lying,
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   and you weren't just mindlessly and habitually moving your lips,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.480]   especially if you had like your praise face on.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   You're like, "Your grace is enough for me."
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   Hopefully you were really saying that as a confession.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   And this isn't a song that we sing as much now,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   but you know that song?
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   ♪ Christ is enough for me ♪
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   Nod your heads if you guys know that song.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   ♪ Christ is enough for me ♪
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   ♪ Everything I need is in you ♪
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   And whenever you sing these kinds of things,
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   it doesn't like cause you to be like, "That's a lie."
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:25.480]   No, so this is a truth that you guys already know academically,
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   but do you really believe this?
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   2 Peter 2, 1-2, Peter warns that there have always been
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   distorters of God's truth,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   and that there will always be false teachers among the people,
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   and that there will be destructive heresies that try and infiltrate the church.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   Okay, so I'm going to read this for you.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   "But false prophets also arose among the people,
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   just as there will also be false teachers among you
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   who will secretly introduce destructive heresies,
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   even denying the master who bought them,
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   Many will follow their sensuality,
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.480]   and because of them, the way of the truth will be maligned."
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   And you know the tricky thing about heresies and lies in general?
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   Heresies contain a whole lot of truth with a slight distortion.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   If heresies were very obviously heresies,
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   it would be a pathetic heresy.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   You guys following that?
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   Heresy, a lot of what is contained in there is truth,
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.480]   with a perversion and a distortion of an element of it.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   And there have been all kinds of destructive heresies
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   that have battered the walls of the churches over the years.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   And here's one destructive heresy
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.480]   that I believe that many in our pews today are tempted to believe.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   Okay, and here it is.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   "I don't have enough."
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   That's a lie.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.480]   "I don't have enough."
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   "I don't have enough money."
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   "I don't have enough time."
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   "I don't have enough knowledge."
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   "I don't have enough worth."
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   And the list goes on and on.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   And so many church people work very hard
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   and expend a lot of energy trying to gain more,
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:19.480]   trying to attain more, trying to buy more,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   trying to move out of state, perhaps.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   Why? Because a part of them has bought into the lie
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   that they don't have enough,
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   or that their circumstances are not enough
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   to make them happy or useful to the Lord.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   What does Peter emphasize here?
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   His divine power has granted to us
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:49.480]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing."
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   You have everything you need for life and godliness.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   Do you believe that?
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   You may not have a lot in your bank account,
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   but you have everything you need for your life of godliness
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   and gospel ministry.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   And I know many of you love Romans chapter 8,
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   verses 31 to 32 are two of my favorite verses in this chapter.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   It reads,
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   "What then shall we say to these things?"
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   "If God is for us, who is against us?"
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   "He who did not spare his own Son,
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.480]   but delivered Him over for us all,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   how will He not also with Him
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   freely give us all things?"
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   So hopefully when you're singing,
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   "Your grace is enough," or "Christ is enough for me,"
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   you're not just honoring Him with your lips
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.480]   while your heart is super far away.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   Do you believe that His divine power
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.480]   has given you everything you need
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   for your life and godliness?
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   So the second thing that has been granted to believers
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   is God's precious and magnificent promises.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:03.480]   So we're not told exactly what the content of the promises is,
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   but the focus of these promises is our participation
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   in the divine nature and escape from corruption that is in the world.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   The world is cursed.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.480]   It's going to burn.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   We escape this corruption, we escape this destruction,
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   and we partake in the divine nature.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   And we gain a little bit more insight into this
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   at the end of the letter in chapter 3, verse 13,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   where the word "promise" is used once again.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   So I'm going to read that for you.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.480]   "But according to His promise, we are looking for new heavens
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   So we have been granted everything we need for life and godliness.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   We have received promises of salvation and a great future hope.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   And all of these things, all of our sufficiency,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   all of our blessings come through a true and full knowledge of God.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   So the word "knowledge" will keep coming up again and again
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   in the entirety of Peter's letter.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   So I'm going to have a slide up here for you,
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   and we'll just read through this real quick.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   "Grace and peace in the knowledge of God,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   through the knowledge of Him,
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   in your moral excellence, knowledge, and in your knowledge,"
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   add such and such a thing,
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   "nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   We may known to you, but know this first of all,
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   escaped by the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.480]   Know this first of all,
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   knowing this beforehand, be on your guard."
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   So the word "knowledge" is very important to the Apostle Peter.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   It's used twice here in just this grammatically challenging section.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   And you'll see it again in verses 5, 6, 8, 16, and 20, just in chapter 1.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   And this whole epistle ends with a last exhortation
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   to actively grow in the knowledge until the very end.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   So verse 18 of chapter 3,
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   Amen."
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   So as I've mentioned before, grammatically,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   this is not an easy verse to fully understand,
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   but what God has given every believer,
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.480]   what you and I have received, is very easy to discern.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   So He has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   And He has granted to us access to know Him,
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   to know of Him, and to be known by Him.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:34.480]   And to know God actually is what eternal life is all about.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.480]   John 17, 3, "This is eternal life, that they may know you,
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:45.480]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   And we remind you time and time again,
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   we have everything we need.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.480]   And if you are a child of God, if you put your faith in Christ,
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   eternal life has already started.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   So here your knowledge of God may be like that of a poor reflection,
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   but one day you will know fully and see Him face to face.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   Eternal life does not start the moment you expire your Lord into the casket,
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   "Oh, eternal life."
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   That's not where it starts.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   It starts with your initial knowledge of the living God.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480]   He is Lord.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   We are slaves.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   We have everything we need.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   We lack nothing.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   Eternal life has already started.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   Our goal in life, our all-encompassing purpose in this life and in the next,
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.480]   is to know Him and to make Him known.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   Do you believe this?
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.480]   Does the way you live your life proclaim this?
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   So going back to our outline,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   who we are is we are slaves of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   What have we been given?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   We have been given everything that we need for life and godliness.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   And this brings us to our final point,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   what sort of people ought we to be?
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   Verse 4 briefly touches upon the truth that we will be partakers of the divine nature.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   So there's an already but not yet element here
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   because these promises, though initiated here,
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   won't be fully actualized until His promise of a new heaven and a new earth is fulfilled.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   So verse 13 of chapter 3,
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   "We are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.480]   And I mentioned to you that a destructive heresy many today are tricked into believing is,
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   "I don't have enough."
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.480]   Here's another one.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:49.480]   "This world is our home."
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   And that's another dangerous lie that you and I cannot be tricked into believing.
[00:59:55.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   "This world is our home" is a very subtle, destructive lie that many are tempted to buy into.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   This is not home.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.480]   The Bible says this place is going to crash and burn.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   So I'm going to read together what the Apostle Peter says about what awaits this world.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   So chapter 3, verses 7 and 10.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   "But by His word, the present heavens and the earth are being reserved for fire,
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   in which the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.480]   and the earth and its works will be burned up."
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   So I don't have enough?
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   That is a lie.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   "This world is our home"--that is another lie.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:00.480]   You know what sounds nice but is extremely foolish?
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   "Let's make this world a better place."
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   Nice but extremely foolish.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   It is great folly and unnecessary distraction if you're thinking of expending a lot of energy
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   making this world more comfortable, more habitable, and more peaceful.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   Why?
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   It's going to crash and burn.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   So trying to make this world a better place
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:33.480]   is akin to applying beautiful paint on cabinets in a burning house.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.480]   So I'm not saying that we shouldn't be good stewards
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   or that we shouldn't be salt and light in the world while we are in this world.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   What I am saying is that we should put very little hope in this world.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   So I actually wrote a list down of what things I would try to save in the event of a fire.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   I'm going to share that with you.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   If I wake up in the middle of the night, things are burning,
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   what am I going to go and scramble to save?
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   The first thing is photo albums.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   Nod your head if you guys would do the same, like old photo albums.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:15.480]   Second, legal documents, social security cards, passports, birth certificates.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   Those things are a hassle to replace, right?
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   I would save legal documents.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.480]   I would go after my laptop because there's important stuff on my laptop.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   Cloud hasn't been updated in about a week and a half,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   and it's a hassle to try to get a new computer, so I would save that.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.480]   I would save my wallet because I need some kind of form of ID.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.480]   I may need my credit cards. I will save that.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.480]   I will save my Bible that I've taken notes on, right,
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   because it's hard to replace all of the inspiration that I've gleaned from just my quiet times.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   I would save my Bible.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.480]   I would go after Bailey, our dog, because she's family.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   She's been with us since 2012, so she's been with us for a while, so I would save Bailey.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   And I would probably grab our car keys, maybe, if I had some time,
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   because you need a temporary shelter and a mode of transportation.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   So I would save all of these things.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   These are all important and valuable and useful to me.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   And some of these things cannot be replaced.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   And some of these things, though they can be replaced,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   it's a big old hassle to try to get them replaced.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   So it would behoove me to grab if I can't.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   So none of you guys are probably thinking I'm going to fault that guy for grabbing these kinds of things, right?
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   You would save your dog, too.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   But if this was the entirety of my list, you would fault me, because what's missing?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   I didn't mention my wife and my kids.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   What about my wife and my kids?
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   So all the other things that I would grab are not unimportant things,
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.480]   and I do hope to get them out of the house.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   But in the event I wake up in the middle of the night to a fire, I need to prioritize.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   I need to prioritize my people.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   I need to prioritize my wife and my kids, even if my dog perishes.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   She's old anyway. She's like 10, right?
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   She's lived a full life.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:19.480]   Even if she were to perish, I would have to go after Becky and the kids first.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   And that's not saying that I don't love Bailey, my dog.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.480]   But I'm going after human family first.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   There's a quick priority being done.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   So make the world a better place.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   What are their foolishness? What backward priorities?
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.480]   The Bible says that this world is going to crash and burn,
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   and that truth is all over the pages of Scripture.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   Prioritize.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.480]   Give your kids a solid college education.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.480]   Save for your retirement.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   Help the world get rid of racism.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   Help the poor.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.480]   Be a voice for the oppressed.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   And these are not unimportant things.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   But our priority, with the short time that we have in this life,
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   get souls restored to their creator.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   Get people saved.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   And remember, His divine nature has granted to you everything pertaining to this task.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.480]   Charles Spurgeon once said it well,
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   "Great numbers of persons in the churches have no concern about eternal things.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   They care more about their cats and their dogs than their souls."
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   And perhaps Spurgeon is describing some of us sitting here today.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   So what is Peter saying here?
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.480]   First, we are slaves of God and our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.480]   Second, what have we been given?
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.480]   We've been given everything we need pertaining to life and godliness.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.480]   We've been given His precious promises that were a seal.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.480]   He does not go back on His promises.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:11.480]   We were given these things, and what sort of people in response ought we to be?
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.480]   And in 2 Peter, there's a ton of applications that Apostle Peter lays out,
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   a ton of exhortations, but I'll just leave you with a couple.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   2 Peter 3, verse 11, 14 and 15.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   "Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way,
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness?
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things,
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless,
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation."
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   So what is he saying?
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:49.480]   Keep yourself unstained by the world and get to work rescuing souls.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.480]   And I'll take you also to the verses immediately following the verses
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.480]   that I read in the beginning, verses 5 through 7.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   "Now for this reason also, applying all diligence in your faith,
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   supply moral excellence in your moral excellence and knowledge,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480]   and in your knowledge self-control, and in your self-control perseverance,
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   and in your perseverance godliness, and in your godliness brotherly kindness,
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.480]   and in your brotherly kindness love."
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.480]   It may be a foolish and distracting endeavor to try to make this world a better place,
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.480]   but we are called to be kind.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   We are called to love.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   But all of that is under the umbrella of knowing God and making Him known
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.480]   because there is no hope outside of Christ.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:42.480]   That has to take central priority in your life.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   You know, as I was meditating upon 2 Peter chapters 1, 1 through 4,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   my mind kept going to Psalm 23.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   You guys know that Psalm, like, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.480]   And to the song, "Shepherd of my soul."
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:06.480]   And there's a line in there that says, "Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   the shepherd of my soul is by my side.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.480]   Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   the shepherd of my soul will be my guide."
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   In life there are seasons where it feels like there are more mighty mountains
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.480]   or dark valleys than there are quiet pastures.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.480]   For me, the 14 months fighting cancer felt like a mighty mountain.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   And sometimes life is full of little inconveniences and challenges.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   How do we respond in worship and trust?
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.480]   How do we conduct ourselves in holiness and godly conduct?
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   Every trial, every inconvenience, every person even, is in your life on purpose.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.480]   How do we respond?
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   In all things we seek to know him and to make him known.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.480]   His sheep hear his voice.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:11.480]   He is a good shepherd, and he has other sheep that are not yet of this fold.
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.480]   You guys following me?
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   He has other sheep that are not yet of this fold.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.480]   So in your knowing him, in your trusting him,
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   our call is to help others to know him and to trust him,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   and you and I have been adequately equipped to do this.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.480]   You lack nothing.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   A lot of things, both big and little, both good and bad, have happened in just the last five weeks.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   So on February 26th, I went in for my final surgery,
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   and up until that point I had an ostomy bag on me.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   And February 26th, I was going to get the stoma taken down,
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.480]   and I was going to go back to life as normal.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.480]   That was my final step in the cancer journey.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   And the first time I was there, I was there for about four days.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   And so I had taken a lot of work to do, because I was thinking,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.480]   "Hey, this whole cancer treatment's been easy.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   After surgery, I'm just going to do memory verses.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   I'll do Bible study and all of these things."
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   And I realized it's kind of hard with all these wires strapped to your fingers and your body
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   and the drugs running through your system.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   So I said, "Okay, this time around, I'm just going to kind of relax."
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.480]   So I was expecting three or four days where I could just sleep.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.480]   I could actually get to a couple TV shows, and I was ready to relax.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   And I was sitting there, laying there, and then all of a sudden,
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.480]   they wheeled in another dude in my room.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   And I was thinking, "Man, I had peace and quiet, but they're wheeling in this other dude."
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.480]   This 18-year-old kid who just had his appendix about to burst,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   so they did an emergency surgery, and then he was there.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:01.480]   And he was a very nice kid, but he was 18.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.480]   And he was talking about--he was calling his friends for three, four hours at a time,
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   talking about all kinds of silly things that 18-year-old kids talk about.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.480]   He was watching his TV shows at a very high volume.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.480]   And at first, I was like, "Lord, you know I need to rest.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   What's going on?"
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   But then the thought that came to mind was, "If every person is on purpose,
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   every meeting is a divine appointment, and I am called to save souls,
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   and he has equipped me for everything pertaining to life and godliness,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   I need to use this to my advantage."
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.480]   He's sitting right next to me.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   So we just talked about life.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   I talked about how I got cancer.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   I talked about my wife and my kids.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   And he just nodded along and then called his girlfriend again.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   So I don't know what happened since then.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   And then after that, I had jury duty.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   A couple--like a week later, I was thinking,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   "Oh, man, I got to take advantage of my last few days off work
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   because once I get back to church, it's going to be busy."
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.480]   And the last few times I did jury duty, it ended really quick.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   But this time around, for some reason, I was there all the way till 4 p.m.,
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   and then they said, "Come back tomorrow."
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   And I was like, "Man, this is so inconvenient."
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.480]   And I just started striking up a conversation with a lady named Deb,
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.480]   and I made a new friend named Alex.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   And each step of the way, I was thinking,
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:32.480]   "Man, there is no shortage of opportunities where God wants me to minister."
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.480]   I don't know if anything happened after that.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   And just a month ago, on March 11th, I got a phone call
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.480]   saying that my mom in Korea had passed away.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   So she got diagnosed with--she was worried about me,
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.480]   and in December, I got a phone call saying that she got diagnosed
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   with lung and bone and breast cancer.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.480]   A little bit had gone into her brain, so it was a little bit urgent.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   And I was thinking, "I need to get to Korea.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.480]   I got to try to figure out how to get there."
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.480]   And I was calling the surgeon, trying to see would I be okay
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.480]   to travel with this ostomy bag.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   And then COVID hit Korea pretty hard,
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.480]   and so I wouldn't have been able to go see my mom.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:19.480]   And then exactly one month ago from today, March 11th, she passed away.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   And the thing that I was thinking was, you know,
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   the emotional highs and lows are there,
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.480]   but the truth of my reality is that His divine power
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   has given me everything I need for life and godliness.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   The truth of the reality of this life is that it's going to end,
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   but she's with the Lord.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   And my main duty in all of this is just trust and obey,
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:14:01.480]   to put my hope in Christ, to know Him, and to make Him known.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   His divine power has given me everything I need to respond
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   to every hurdle, every high mountain, every low valley,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.480]   in a way that gives Him glory.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.480]   In every trial, in every inconvenience, in every joy, success, and victory,
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:29.480]   in every relationship, what is your purpose, oh beloved slave?
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   You are to trust Him, to know Him, and make Him known.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   You know what, that hymn, "Trust and Obey, for there's no other way," what?
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.480]   To be happy in Jesus.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   So to the shepherd of your soul, give Him full control,
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.480]   and wherever He may lead you, follow and follow well.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   remember that the shepherd of your soul is by your side.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   You lack nothing.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His glory and excellence.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:22.480]   You lack nothing.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:30.480]   And as our good shepherd leads you through the highs and lows of this life,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.480]   worship, trust, obey, know Him, and make Him known.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:49.480]   Amen? Let's pray.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:57.480]   Father, we need your help
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   to know how to properly give you the worship that you do
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   in every situation, in every circumstance.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.480]   And we pray that as we walk with you, that you would give us greater wisdom,
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   greater insight, greater faith,
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   so that as we walk with you, we will grow in excellence in knowing how to trust and obey.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.480]   Lord, we thank you for your kindness in our lives.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   We thank you for your patience.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Help us to reflect you in a way that is so pleasing.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   Let us all rise using our closed praise.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   [piano music]
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   Let's sing "Shepherd of my Soul."
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   Shepherd of my soul, I give you full control.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will follow.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   I have made the choice to listen for your voice.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will go.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   Let's sing "Shepherd of my Soul."
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:41.480]   Shepherd of my soul, I give you full control.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will follow.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:55.480]   I have made the choice to listen for your voice.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will go.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:09.480]   Be it in a flying pasture or by a gentle stream,
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   the shepherd of my soul is by my side.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:23.480]   Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep,
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.480]   the shepherd of my soul will be by my side.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   Shepherd of my soul.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:41.480]   Shepherd of my soul, I give you full control.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will follow.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   I have made the choice to listen for your voice.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   Wherever you may lead, I will go.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   Be it in a flying pasture or by a gentle stream,
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   the shepherd of my soul is by my side.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:23.480]   Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep,
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:28.480]   the shepherd of my soul will be by my side.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:37.480]   Be it in a flying pasture or by a gentle stream,
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   the shepherd of my soul is by my side.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:51.480]   Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:58.480]   the shepherd of my soul will be by my side.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   The shepherd of my soul will be by my side.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   [music]
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.480]   That's great.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   Lord, we give you full control of our lives,
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   and we ask that you would help us,
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.480]   help our passions to daily more and more just align themselves
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   with yours, and would you grant us just wisdom and grace
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   and insight as we seek to love those around us
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   and as we seek to be just a blessing
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480]   in the lives of those around us.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   We ask for your help.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   We thank you, Lord, for your kindness.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.480]   and the love of our Heavenly Father
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.480]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   be with each and every one of us now and forevermore.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480]   Amen.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   [music]
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:13.480]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   He came to the world, the earth,
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:34.480]   to the dead to buy my heart.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:45.480]   An empty grave is there to save your life.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:07.480]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.480]   All right, if you guys are sitting
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   on this side of the sanctuary, we
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   do ask that you would, in an orderly fashion,
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.480]   go out that way.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.480]   And for you guys who are here, go out through the courtyard.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   We thank you.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.480]   Have a victorious week.
