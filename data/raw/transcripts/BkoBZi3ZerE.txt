[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:54.500]   Father God, we just thank you again
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.000]   for the privilege that we have to come here
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   to study your word together, to sing these songs to you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.500]   We pray, Lord God, that wherever we come from,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.000]   that we would come here with focused minds and hearts.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.500]   Would you give us energy and strength
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.000]   if we're tired from a long day?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I pray, Lord God, as we come here,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.500]   that you'd allow us to have humble hearts, hearts that
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   are teachable and moldable, that desire to learn more
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000]   about who you are.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I pray, Lord, that as we just go into a time of singing,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.500]   that we would really be able to sing these lyrics to you
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.000]   as an act of worship.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.500]   And would you be pleased, God?

[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Would you bless this night?

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   All right.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Can you join me in prayer, and then we'll start chapter 4.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.500]   Father, we come tonight just to study your word.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.000]   And you've been so faithful to us just in the last four months.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.500]   And as we are now in the latter two chapters,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   I pray that you would help us to be even more hungry to know
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   your truth, but to be more zealous to apply these truths
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.000]   into our lives.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I pray that you would just help us discuss,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   help us to fellowship through the text,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and help us to learn really what it means to live a life
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.500]   according to the will of God.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.000]   And so we pray for just your help to discern your truth.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And I pray that you would open our eyes
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   so that we would see just the beauty of the things
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   that are written in your holy scriptures.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And so we thank you, Lord.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We entrust our time to you.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.500]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.000]   Let me just start off by reading chapter 4, verses 1 through 6.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   arm yourselves also with the same purpose,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   For the time already past is sufficient for you
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   to have carried out the desires of the Gentiles,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   In all this they are surprised that you do not run with them
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   into the same excesses of dissipation,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   and they malign you.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But they will give account to him who is ready to judge
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   the living and the dead.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   For the gospel has for this purpose been preached
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   even to those who are dead,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   that though they are judged in the flesh as men,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   they may live in the Spirit according to the will of God."
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   That's a lot of SAT words on here.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   All right, so...
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Can you flip for me?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Okay, so I'm going to just break you guys up
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   into our discussion time as normal.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   That clock is wrong, and so right now it's 7.15,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and at 8.20 we'll resume just with the wrap-up time.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   But the last part that I want you guys to focus on
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   is there's a lot of purpose and will of God talk
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   in this section, okay?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   So just to think through for what purpose
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   was the gospel preached?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And that's something that after your discussion
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   that I would think it would be beneficial for you guys
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   to spend some time just discussing, all right?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So 8.20 is when we'll resume,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and then, yeah, just enjoy your time with your group.

[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   [audience chatter]
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.660]   - I'm gonna just grab all your,
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:35.660]   just get your attention up here real quick.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:50.060]   All right, so this is how I start
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.400]   pretty much every Bible study on my end.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.640]   I try to make it a little bit of an outline.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.560]   Some are easier than others.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.440]   This one I found to be a little bit difficult,
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.360]   maybe because I didn't take enough verses.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.840]   But this, it's just a process of doing this helps
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.960]   to kind of organize my thoughts.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.880]   So this is not near perfect at all.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.520]   This is probably the least happy I've been
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.160]   with an outline that I put up in the front, okay?
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.400]   So that's just kind of a disclaimer.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.680]   But let me walk you through this.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.440]   So the main thing that I see is arm yourself.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.680]   That's the only command.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.540]   And some of you guys who've looked into it,
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.520]   nod your heads if you understood
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.800]   that that's like a military term, right?
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.060]   So arming yourself, that's the only command.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.760]   And whenever there is a command in Scripture,
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.240]   those are usually where the important meaty parts,
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.280]   that's where you need to start.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.280]   That's the yellow.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.760]   The red, the therefores are always important,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.920]   the buts are always important.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.360]   And as I was charting through this outline,
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.360]   I would have actually high-lit in red that because, right?
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.800]   Arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.360]   I was like, wait a minute, this,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.340]   how you understand this because,
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.400]   changes some of your meaning.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.920]   So I would have made that red.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.320]   There's a lot of suffer in the flesh talk.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.800]   You guys notice that?
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.680]   I just put that in the purple.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.320]   A lot of like physical death stuff,
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.880]   I would put that in the purple.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.880]   And then all the activity of the Gentiles, I underlined.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   And I try to put it in the same column.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.000]   So I'm seeing like lusts of men, Gentiles,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.540]   sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.920]   abominable idolatries, surprise,
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.360]   excesses of dissipation, malign.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.920]   Okay, so those are, so my eyes will go there.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.440]   These are all things that I don't want in my life, right?
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.720]   The blue, this is where I started getting a little bit like,
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.160]   ah, I don't know if this is a highlight worthy.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.520]   The same purpose talk, because that's kind of related,
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.720]   but I noticed that the word for same purpose,
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.320]   the first blue and the second blue are different.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.300]   So it's probably not right to highlight it in blue.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.160]   So if I stare at this another day,
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.800]   I'll probably change it up a little bit.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.360]   Same thing for the will of God.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.120]   There is a lot of will of God talk in 1 Peter,
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   but in verse six, the will actually is an added word.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   That's not in the original language.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.320]   So I'm like, ah, so I loosely highlighted it.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.360]   But the reason this is helpful is it kind of hones
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.920]   my attention on what's important for me to remember
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.600]   and understand from this passage.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:49.680]   The first big thing is arm yourself.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.380]   Okay, so we're gonna look at that.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:56.360]   Okay, this is the only time this word is used
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.760]   in the entire New Testament.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:05.040]   It's this word haplizo, to arm yourself with weapons
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.700]   or to put on armor.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.400]   Okay, so to gear up basically.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.760]   And anytime this is used as a noun,
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.100]   it's always in reference to a weapon.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.520]   Okay, so our weapon for the Christian life
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.080]   is the suffering of Christ.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.160]   Eek, okay.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.880]   And this is mentioned starting from chapter two
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.140]   all the way here, right?
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.800]   That our main weapon, our weapons are not of this world.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.920]   Okay, in fact, they have spiritual power
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.160]   to demolish strongholds.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.320]   Those are our weapons.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.420]   So the main command here is to arm me.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   So I'm gonna rephrase this first verse like this.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.440]   Therefore, since all that you just saw, okay,
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.480]   about Jesus having all authorities and powers
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.800]   subjected to him, him suffering in the flesh,
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   because of all of that, haplizo, with the same purpose.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:11.440]   Because sin no longer has dominion over those
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.520]   who have been united with Christ
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.840]   with suffering and his death.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.280]   And going back from what we looked at last week, okay?
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.220]   So the worst thing that could happen to you
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.040]   is you just go to eternity early.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.420]   You go home early.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.220]   That is the worst thing that can happen to you.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.900]   And sometimes God will ordain that.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.780]   But he's in control over all things.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.060]   We're not supposed to fear those
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.140]   who can only kill the body.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.420]   We need to fear the one who has control
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.860]   over the body and the soul.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.180]   He's in control, he's standing on our behalf,
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.940]   but he ordains suffering in the midst of a wicked world.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.180]   So arm yourself, gear up, okay?
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:57.180]   So that's kind of the main takeaway is to arm myself.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:03.040]   And then with what?
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.420]   The same purpose.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.260]   Now if you guys noticed, all five translations
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.660]   that I put up here, it's translated
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.900]   a little bit differently.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:14.180]   And when you're doing a comparative Bible study
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.680]   and the translations are all a little bit different,
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.380]   what that tells you is the original word
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.520]   is a little bit difficult to translate
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.060]   because there are different nuances, okay?
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.540]   So if we're supposed to arm ourselves with what?
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:32.740]   Well, so it's a little bit more complicated, right?
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:37.740]   So we're supposed to arm ourselves with the same annoyah.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.780]   And basically the way you can understand that
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.980]   is just a willingness to suffer and to die.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.700]   That was in chapter two, that was in chapter three,
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.740]   and now it's also mentioned again in chapter four.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.860]   Nod your heads if you've noticed,
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.420]   we've been in suffering a lot in 1 Peter.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.580]   Yeah, so just get ready, all right?
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.820]   Be prepared is the encouragement.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:06.620]   And so I found just an interesting thought on this
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.940]   just by John MacArthur, and I just wanted to read this
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.000]   'cause it really was well put.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.180]   Thousands of martyrs throughout church history
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.580]   have been willing to die
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.180]   because they armed themselves with the same purpose
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:25.720]   Jesus Christ had, to be faithful to the Father,
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:30.580]   no matter what, knowing that the cross precedes the crown.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.200]   The greater the righteous suffering,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.060]   the greater is the reward, and history's martyrs
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.900]   realize that there is the greatest triumph of all in death
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:45.100]   because believers who have died have ceased from sin.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.680]   The perfect tense verb emphasizes
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.020]   a permanent condition free from sin.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:55.820]   So the challenge for you and me, though,
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:00.300]   is we're living in a society
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.340]   where Christianity is kind of accepted.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.120]   Right?
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.200]   And it's difficult for me to, I have risked my life,
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.440]   and I have put my life in danger for gospel-related work,
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:15.640]   but on a day-to-day, my life is not threatened.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.120]   If anything, people just consider me snooty
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.640]   or they don't like me, and I don't like not being liked,
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.960]   but why does persecution and opposition come?
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.880]   Usually because even if I don't say anything,
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.260]   if someone really disagrees with how I live,
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.740]   sometimes they might be hostile, right?
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.500]   So this is nowhere near persecution,
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.900]   but let me just give you an example of my college days
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:44.380]   and something that happened to me, all right,
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.000]   where I was persecuted for my faith, all right?
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.880]   So at Berkeley, there's a thing called,
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.520]   they used to have a thing called black lightning notes,
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   which basically someone gets paid to sit in a lecture class
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.380]   and type the lecture verbatim,
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:05.380]   and they print that out so that I can subscribe to it,
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.200]   I can get it, and so, I mean, I should still go to class,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.400]   but I could have these notes
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.000]   so I could read the professor's lecture.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.700]   Anybody else have those at school?
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.960]   Dang.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.560]   See, Berkeley, we're all ahead of the game.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.520]   Big cheaters.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.640]   No, anyway, it was totally legal.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.520]   The thing that you were not supposed to do
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.800]   was we were not supposed to print them
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.900]   and Xerox these notes,
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.700]   'cause this is how other college students made money, right?
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:38.460]   So it actually said, "Copyright, do not print, do not copy,"
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.160]   but a bunch of my church people,
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.020]   my class, my freshman class,
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.660]   they actually were in the habit of one person
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.140]   buys a black lightning note subscription,
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:51.180]   and they make copies of it,
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.460]   and they give it to all the same
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.940]   poor college students in the class,
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.980]   and I remember I didn't feel comfortable with this.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:00.720]   I had a tender conscience as a freshman in college,
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.800]   and I kind of said, "You know what?
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.280]   "I'm not gonna do that.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.760]   "I'll just buy my own,"
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.160]   but that hurt my friendship.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.320]   I won't say the name,
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.660]   but that hurt my friendship with a dude,
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.280]   and I didn't say anything except, "I'm not gonna do this
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.800]   "because I just don't feel comfortable with it,"
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.320]   but the three people that were the biggest culprits in this,
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:24.560]   they started not liking me.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.540]   Again, this is the first world version of persecution.
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.780]   They started distancing themselves from me
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.740]   because they did not agree with what I did,
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.140]   even though what they did was in the wrong,
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.340]   mainly not because I pointed anything out,
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.260]   but mainly because I was doing something
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:48.060]   that they knew was the right behavior,
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.360]   but they didn't like that,
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.340]   and so they started heaping their abuses on me, right?
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:55.180]   I'm just kidding.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.320]   So this is a silly illustration,
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:02.400]   but a lot of the persecution happens in our Christian lives
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.600]   simply because we're doing
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.240]   what we're supposed to be doing, hopefully,
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.820]   and the non-Christian world,
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:12.520]   and even the churched people look at that,
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.980]   and they'll scoff and scorn and say, "You are legalistic.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.520]   "You are self-righteous,"
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.600]   and they will heap their abuse on you,
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.500]   and then this next list is what is described here, okay?
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:29.520]   So whenever we, this is another series of lists.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.760]   We've had a few in 1 Peter,
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.120]   and what I like to do is when I go through an epistle
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:39.120]   and there are lists of qualities, I just compile them, okay?
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.400]   And so on my notes here,
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.760]   there's a list of all the details thus far
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.280]   that have been used to describe the Gentiles, all right?
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.040]   Ignorant, malicious, deceitful, hypocritical,
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.340]   envious, slanderous, disobedient,
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.340]   they're in darkness, they're fleshly and lustful,
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:04.840]   drunkenness, idolatrous, and excessive, okay?
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.400]   And obviously, I might have missed some,
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.560]   and then I go to the right, and I just said,
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.200]   "Okay, these are the Gentiles' behavior
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   "toward either Christ or Christians,"
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.400]   and I noticed fiery trials, rejection,
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.360]   slander, reviling as evildoers,
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.280]   treating unreasonably, abusively,
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.240]   and there's even almost like a provoked offense, okay?
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.460]   So I make this list, all right?
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.820]   And it's interesting, this list that we looked at today,
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:41.820]   it mentions alcohol twice, sexuality three times,
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.760]   and some kind of pagan idolatrous practice.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.280]   Did you guys notice that?
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.400]   'Cause I was like, what's the difference
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.920]   between sensuality and lusts, okay?
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.800]   So I actually did a little bit of research.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:01.640]   This is just one example of some of the pagan idolatries,
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.380]   okay, I don't think this is related
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:07.520]   to the Korean drink, bakkas, the energy drink, all right?
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.340]   But there is a word, if you study it,
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.240]   like for SATs, like bakkanalian,
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.720]   which means just kind of indulging in excess partying, right?
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.720]   But I found this very interesting, okay?
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:22.440]   Bakkas has a divine mission, okay, he's a god,
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.660]   and that is his role of liberator.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.560]   During his drunken frenzies, bakkas loosens the tongues
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   of those who partake of wine and other beverages,
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.380]   and it allows people the freedom to say
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.660]   and do what they wish.
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.200]   In mid-March, secret rituals were held
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.960]   on Rome's Aventine Hill to worship him.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.080]   These rites were attended by women only
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.080]   and were part of a mystery religion built up around bakkas.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.780]   Bakkas is a god of the theatrical arts, aka entertainment.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:31:01.640]   In his earlier incarnation as the Greek Dionysus,
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.600]   he had a theater named for him in Athens.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.160]   He is often portrayed as a slightly effeminate figure,
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.920]   prone to good humor and general bawdiness.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.720]   So they celebrated this party animal god, okay?
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:24.720]   And that was part of the Roman Empire and the world, okay?
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.360]   And so perhaps Christians refused to engage
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.660]   in this kind of behavior.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:36.260]   Then I look at the list again,
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.860]   and there were many, many, many more qualities
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.820]   about those who have ceased from sin, all right?
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:46.020]   Those who are now of the faith,
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.980]   chosen, sanctified, protected, joyful,
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:51.500]   they love God, love man, believe, trust in God,
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.500]   suffer for righteousness, and that's mentioned
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.300]   in almost every chapter, sober, sound,
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.140]   gentle, quiet in spirit, they're future-focused,
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   holy in behavior, they live life fearing God,
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.520]   there's a longing and a hunger for milk,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.200]   they're in the light, they live in freedom,
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.200]   and these are Christian attitudes toward all people,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.140]   Christian, non-Christian, okay?
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:17.980]   Good conduct despite accusations,
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:22.220]   there's a submissive, gentle, quiet humbleness,
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:25.460]   Christians are to honor all people,
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.180]   Christians are not to return evil for evil,
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:31.580]   or reviling for reviling, they are chaste,
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.340]   they don't make threats, they give blessing,
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:38.180]   they seek peace, they live with purpose,
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.260]   they live in the will of God,
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.340]   they're understanding and sympathetic,
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:48.220]   they're engaged and responsive in sharing.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:53.700]   Now I make those two lists, and I did a little,
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.780]   just I put it together, okay?
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:01.300]   (pages rustling)
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:05.660]   But you know the thought that I have today is like,
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:10.260]   you know, there's a lot of people that go to church
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:16.660]   that are actually more in line with the top.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:21.860]   Would you guys agree?
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.540]   So after I made this list,
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.880]   there was a little bit of a discomfort,
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.940]   like there's a lot of church people
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:34.900]   that I could characterize closely more with the top
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.960]   than with the bottom.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:44.900]   Which means there's a lot of people
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:48.100]   who claim the name of Christ
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.580]   who have not armed themselves to suffer
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.100]   for the sake of righteousness,
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:59.240]   but have armed themselves to indulge.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.540]   And that's what this passage is speaking against.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:10.580]   So just take a look at the top and look at the bottom.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:17.940]   Because the more your life
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.380]   is like the qualities you see on the top,
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:25.580]   you're gonna avoid suffering to the best of your ability,
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.180]   and you're gonna twist your theology
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.700]   to make it seem like comfort
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:34.440]   is the goal of the Christian faith.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.640]   Are you guys tracking?
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:46.540]   If my chief goal is to finish this Netflix series,
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:49.740]   and then to go on to the next Netflix series,
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.300]   and to just indulge my flesh,
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.220]   finish this video game in 120 hours,
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:59.500]   just enjoy this life,
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:03.300]   my spiritual senses are not gonna be keen
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.040]   to pursuing people's souls or evangelizing.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:11.620]   And then over time, I just start becoming more and more
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.820]   just like a fat, out-of-shape soldier
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.660]   who is no good for fighting anything.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.440]   So when I look at this list,
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.760]   I'm rebuked and challenged that like,
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.060]   man, there's a lot of the bottom that I am not like.
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:29.720]   And in some ways,
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.320]   it's just a discouraging thing to think about.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:36.240]   So the natural question for me is,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.280]   in what way do I need to actually better arm myself?
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.620]   Because yeah, the lusts of men,
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.680]   that's supposed to be in my past.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.280]   How am I supposed to make adjustments in my life
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.360]   so that the bottom is more characteristic of me
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.200]   than the top?
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.160]   And it's all kind of connected.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.660]   Have you guys ever, if you guys work out,
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.720]   like if you get into that stretch of a week or two
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.060]   of just working out hardcore,
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.720]   does it change your diet as well?
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.820]   Oh, for sure.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.940]   Nobody goes, dude, I ran 10 miles today,
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.040]   so I'm gonna eat a pizza.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.680]   No one does that, okay?
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.840]   Some people, like they'll work out hardcore,
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.040]   and then they're like, I gotta maximize my hydration.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.880]   They'll drink, drink, they'll stop drinking soda.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.100]   Then they'll maximize their food, right?
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.880]   But when you let yourself go with disciplines,
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.280]   you kind of let yourself go with all of them.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.520]   That's just human nature, right?
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.160]   So which side are you?
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.780]   Which are you pursuing more of in terms of arming yourself?
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.960]   Because the more you're like the top,
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.560]   the less you will arm yourself
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.920]   with the same attitude as that of Christ.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.720]   Now, that discourages me, okay?
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.720]   Because 1 Peter 4, 2 says,
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.300]   so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh,
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.080]   no longer for the lust of men, but for the will of God.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.880]   And then I ask myself, man, what is wrong with me?
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.440]   And I wanna leave you with a visual, okay?
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.980]   This was a long, long, long time ago.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   In my younger days at a retreat site in Yucaipa,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.400]   I saw a lizard sunbathing against the curb.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.160]   And in the interest of science,
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.680]   'cause I've always heard that if you hit a lizard
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.840]   in the tail, the tail starts to go crazy.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.360]   Did you guys know this?
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.640]   Yeah, you guys know that, right?
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.920]   So the lizard was sunbathing.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.160]   It was at 7.30 in the morning,
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.760]   and I was 23 at the time, okay?
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.020]   I wasn't like seven, but I was 23.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.720]   So I kicked the lizard just in the interest of science.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.960]   And the tail broke.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.680]   It was about this much of the tail.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.720]   And that thing started going nuts.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.960]   It started flailing and going (imitates tail flailing)
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.400]   Right?
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.360]   And then I was thinking, this is a fascinating,
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.200]   and I was a youth pastor already at the time,
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.760]   so I was like, this is a good illustration, right?
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.160]   So I asked the kids, hey, is this tail dead or alive?
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.080]   Like, ew, Pastor Peter, that's so gross.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.900]   But I was like, is this dead or alive, right?
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.700]   But the answer really is, it's dead,
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:16.260]   because it's disconnected from the body,
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.900]   but it's still dying, right?
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.860]   And so that's something, if anything for all of us,
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.320]   when you look at the two lists,
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.500]   and you see yourself and you feel yourself,
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.040]   man, I feel so condemned.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.500]   Sin is dead in you.
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:35.060]   You have ceased from sin.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:39.160]   But there is still the flesh kicking and screaming,
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.560]   not wanting to die.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.320]   And so sin is dead in you, but it's still dying.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.120]   And that's a visual that I wanted to leave you with
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.200]   so that we're not feeling like completely
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:54.560]   condemned, hopeless, and lost.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.560]   This is my 22nd year as a pastor,
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.680]   28th year as a Christian, and I can tell you for a fact,
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.160]   there have been some changes in the last 28 years.
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:08.040]   One, my view of God has increased.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.220]   He is so much more holy, so much more powerful,
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:15.340]   so much more good than I thought of him at 15 years old.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:21.660]   He is a God who really is worthy to be praised.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:26.900]   And at the same time, my view of self has gotten very low.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.500]   At 15, I thought I was God's gift of Christendom.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.720]   Now I'm like, I am a dirty man.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.700]   I have very little confidence in me.
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.020]   I have very little trust in me.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.440]   So my view of God has increased.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.720]   My view of self has totally decreased.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.740]   And I'm a lot more aware of my dirtiness and my filthiness,
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:55.740]   but strangely enough, I have a lot more compassion and love
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:59.360]   than I did when I was 15 or in my first year of ministry.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.380]   So sometimes the examination of my heart
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:06.180]   through passages like this is very helpful
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:10.080]   also just to track how far I've come in my faith.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.100]   But until we're on the other side of eternity,
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.380]   this struggle to put sin to death
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.860]   is gonna be an ongoing one.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:22.220]   So arm yourself with the same attitude.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.140]   And sometimes the suffering that God ordains
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:28.280]   is actually very good for our spiritual condition.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.540]   It sobers you up real fast.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:36.780]   I wanna just read four, one through six again,
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.580]   and then I wanna look at one 17 to 19
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:41.260]   'cause it's similar in theme.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.180]   Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh,
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.340]   arm yourselves also with the same purpose,
[01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:46.820]   because he who has suffered in the flesh
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.420]   has ceased from sin.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.260]   So as to live the rest of the time in the flesh
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.000]   no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.220]   For the time already past is sufficient for you
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.500]   to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles,
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.700]   having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts,
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.340]   drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties,
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:03.420]   and abominable idolatries.
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:06.540]   In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:10.380]   into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:11.420]   But they will give account to him
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.140]   who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.740]   For the gospel has for this purpose
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.740]   been preached even to those who are dead,
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.860]   that though they are judged in the flesh as men,
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:22.940]   they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:26.180]   So how are we to live our lives as believers?
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.700]   Verse 17 of chapter one is a reminder
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.560]   from what we studied about two months ago.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:36.120]   If you address as father the one who impartially judges
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.180]   according to each one's work,
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.580]   conduct yourselves in fear
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.700]   during the time of your stay on earth,
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.980]   knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.100]   like silver or gold from your feudal way of life
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.020]   inherited from your forefathers,
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:51.460]   but with the precious blood as of the lamb,
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.220]   unblemished and spotless.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.380]   So a couple themes in 1 Peter.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:57.820]   Suffering is a big one.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.940]   But fear of God is another.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.380]   Okay, and I'm gonna end with just a reading
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.260]   from C.S. Lewis's,
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.660]   you guys ever read "Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"?
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:12.420]   Do you guys remember who Lucy is?
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.220]   Okay, she's the baby, okay?
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:17.060]   And the name of the lion that represents God,
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.380]   his name is Aslan.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:19.980]   You guys know the story?
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.060]   So I wanna read a little excerpt.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:26.940]   So this is in Narnia,
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.900]   and the children, they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver,
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.140]   and they're describing to them for the first time
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:34.340]   this mighty lion, okay?
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:37.140]   "Is he a man?" asked Lucy.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.940]   "Aslan, a man?" said Mr. Beaver sternly.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.620]   "Certainly not.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.340]   "I tell you, he is king of the wood
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.420]   "and the son of the great emperor beyond the sea.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.820]   "Don't you know who is the king of the beasts?
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.540]   "Aslan is a lion, the lion, the great lion."
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.660]   "Ooh," said Susan.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.020]   "I thought he is a man.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.080]   "Is he quite safe?
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:06.860]   "I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion."
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:10.780]   "That you will, dearie, and no mistake," said Mrs. Beaver.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.380]   "If there's anyone who can appear before Aslan
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:14.980]   "without their knees knocking,
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.380]   "they're either braver than most or else just silly."
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:24.560]   "Then he isn't safe?" said Lucy.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.020]   "Safe?" said Mr. Beaver.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.400]   "Don't you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you?
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.820]   "Who said anything about safe?
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:35.700]   "Course he isn't safe, but he's good.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.660]   "He's the king, I tell you."
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.100]   And that's from "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.580]   And I share that all to say it by saying
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.740]   we need to fear God in this life.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:51.140]   We need to live our life trembling,
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.820]   but approaching the throne of grace
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.180]   with a supernatural confidence
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:01.700]   that doesn't come from our worth,
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:05.080]   but from what Christ did and who he is.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.860]   And when we are called to suffer,
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:13.700]   know that he's ordained it,
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.380]   know that it's on purpose,
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.460]   and be sober enough to take advantage
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.220]   of the opportunities to give him glory.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:23.000]   And that's our passage for today, all right?
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.100]   So this is for next week, verses seven through 11.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:30.060]   It's just five verses.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.960]   And then the last question that I want you guys to prepare
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.420]   is what is a gift?
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:40.500]   What gifts are you using to build up the church?
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:43.020]   Okay, so I'm gonna post this on Facebook
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.860]   so you don't need to scramble to write this down.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.900]   And this is for today.
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:52.380]   For the remainder of the time,
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.340]   what is the purpose of your life?
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.160]   With what have you been arming yourself
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.780]   in fulfilling that purpose?
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:05.100]   Second question, are believers or unbelievers more surprised?
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.380]   Are believers or unbelievers more surprised
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.680]   by how you live your life?
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.620]   And third, what are some ways the members of your group
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.660]   can pray for you and help keep you accountable
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:19.140]   in applying the truths we see in 1 Peter 4, 1 through 6?
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:20.580]   Okay, let me pray for us
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.240]   and then we'll dismiss into our small group time.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:30.000]   Lord, help us to walk in obedience and in fear,
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.900]   not fear of our circumstances,
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.460]   not fear of the persecution and the suffering
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.460]   that can happen as we live our godly lives here,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.700]   but help us to walk in fear of you,
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.540]   for you are holy, holy, holy God.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.900]   And Lord, help us to arm ourselves
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.620]   really with this same mindset
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:56.500]   that we would be able to respond in all circumstances
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.720]   that come our way in worship,
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.940]   in faithfulness and in obedience.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.100]   We pray all of these things in Jesus' name.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:14.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
