[00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:03.160]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.920]   Hope you all had a good week in the Lord.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.380]   We're gonna go ahead and start our service
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.600]   for this first song.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.440]   Great is the Lord, as we reflect on who he is,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.300]   what he's done, that he truly is great.

[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.160]   - All right, good morning.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.440]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   We wanna give you a few announcements
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.640]   before we get started.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.920]   But those of you who are online,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.040]   I just wanna give you a heads up.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.800]   We're having internet issues, or we've had,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   and so we're not able to stream normally
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   through our normal equipment that we have,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.840]   so they are going through.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   Huh?
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.360]   My information is outdated.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.040]   They said it's going well now, okay?
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.480]   Anyway, all right.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.080]   I forget that one, all right.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   Well, along with that, okay,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.360]   we just wanna make an announcement
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.320]   because you know when all the pandemic started last year,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.360]   we actually took a little bit longer to shut down.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.280]   And it wasn't because we weren't taking
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.300]   the pandemic seriously.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.080]   We wanted to make sure that the high value
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.760]   of the saints gathering together in the church
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.320]   was not easily compromised.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.040]   And so we wanted to make sure that
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.600]   whether we are here physically
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.480]   or when we're online,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.440]   that the physical gathering of the church
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.760]   is really the church.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.560]   And obviously what we experienced last year
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.760]   and even some today,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.800]   we're doing this because this is a special circumstance
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.480]   that we're in, but this is not something
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.840]   that the church should be in the habit of doing.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.880]   So I'm talking to my friends
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.800]   who have been shut down for a while
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.320]   and they're trying to get the church back,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.080]   and they're really having a hard time
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.760]   getting the people who are online to get back to church.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.300]   And this is what we wanted to try to prevent.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.760]   They wanted to make sure that we gather
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   as soon as we're able to gather.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.560]   And so again, we know that we're still
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.620]   in a very special circumstance
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.280]   and with the various things that is going on,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.560]   but we do want to emphasize that
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.200]   if not to get in the habit of just worshiping online,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   because that's a temporary situation
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.080]   that as soon as you're able to,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.200]   that we ask you to either join the church physically
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   or to find a church locally
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.960]   that you can physically gather together
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.280]   when things are, that you're able to do so.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.980]   So we want to encourage you guys to do that.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.100]   And then let me get you to the announcement.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.780]   First of all, we have a members meeting here at 2.30 p.m.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.760]   So right after the service,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.080]   the service fair tables are going to be set up outside.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.740]   And so we'll give you an opportunity,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.100]   for those of you who are members in the church,
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.980]   opportunity to go visit those tables
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.340]   just so that you can see what's going on in the church.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.220]   Some of the tables are open for you to visit just to see.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.040]   Some of the tables are actually trying to recruit people
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.060]   to help out with the ministries that they're in.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.820]   But this will be taking place after the members meeting.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.140]   So if you, for whatever reason, cannot make it,
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.620]   please let us know as soon as possible.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.440]   And then right after the service,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.220]   you'll have plenty of time to go grab lunch
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.400]   and then try to be here 2.30 sharp.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.420]   So we're going to start at 2.30 sharp.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.220]   And there will, we won't be having live streaming.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.820]   So it will only be done live.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.600]   And so please join us at 2.30.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.780]   For those of you who are members
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.900]   or are being introduced as members.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.260]   This coming Friday at 7.30, we have praise and prayer.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.100]   So please try to come to church right
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.580]   or come a little bit earlier than that.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.700]   And then we'll have our corporate time of prayer together
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.220]   this coming Friday.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.860]   And then fall Bible study, that's starting in September.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.140]   If you have not signed up,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.180]   especially for those of you who are in home groups,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.180]   I know that there's a temptation to think like,
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.500]   well, I've been in the same home group
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.460]   for the last two, three sessions.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.540]   So just assume that we're part of that.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.160]   We need to know if we have enough space in that home
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.380]   because a lot of the home group Bible studies are impacted.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.160]   So if you happen to sign up later,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.580]   we may have to move you to another home group.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.040]   And so if you haven't signed up,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.540]   we ask you to do that today if possible,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.700]   so that we'll have a head count
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.560]   and be able to add more Bible studies
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.240]   and move some people around if we need to.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.840]   So if you're part of the home groups
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.680]   and you haven't signed up,
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.600]   please do that as soon as possible.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.340]   Okay, today if possible.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.520]   And then along with that, the Bible study that's coming up,
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   we have the Bible study prep class
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.700]   that Pastor Mark is leading.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.360]   And so that's basically how to do Bible study
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.600]   in order so that you can get the most out of the home groups
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.760]   and the small groups that we're having.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.800]   And so if you need help with that,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.840]   and I think it'll be beneficial for most of us,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.040]   take that class and that's starting in August.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   And Pastor Mark is gonna lead three weeks of that
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   to help you to do how to do inductive Bible study, okay?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.920]   All right, so I'll give you a few minutes.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.980]   We're gonna take some time to pray for the offering.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.640]   And then again, you can give online
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.600]   if you have physical checks,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.760]   we have a box in the back, offering box,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.320]   and you can use that, all right?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   Let's pray.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.520]   - Heavenly Father, we thank you for the grace
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.160]   that we are aware of,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.040]   and the grace, Lord God,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.360]   that you are applying in our lives, Lord,
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.820]   in order for us to endure and persevere
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.840]   and know who you are.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   We pray, Father, that this morning
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.440]   that you would anoint this time,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.940]   help us, Lord, whatever distractions
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.960]   that we have been entangled with this week,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.360]   help us to lift our eyes to Christ,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.920]   that we may have a better understanding of who you are,
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.380]   that we may give you worship
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.020]   that truly is in spirit and in truth.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.640]   So even in this giving,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.040]   help us to give to you, Lord God,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.120]   not out of habit, but out of genuine worship
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.340]   that may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.580]   for the purpose of your kingdom.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.340]   (gentle piano music)
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.420]   (gentle piano music)
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.500]   (gentle piano music)

[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   I posted a song, a new song called "Grace."
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.200]   And as we have been reflecting through Mount Sinai
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.560]   and comparing to Mount Zion,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.320]   we are grateful that we have a Mount Zion,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.960]   that we can come to God with grace.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.040]   So as we sing this song, I hope we would reflect
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   on those words that we sing to our God.

[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.320]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.680]   to Hebrews chapter 12, verses 18 through 24.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.360]   We're gonna be looking at verse 22 and on today,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   but I wanna read it in the context of verse 18 through 24.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:57.700]   Okay, reading out of the NASB.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.080]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.720]   and to a blazing fire and to the darkness and gloom
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.440]   and whirlwind and to the blast of the trumpet
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.640]   and the sound of words which sound was such
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.480]   that those who heard begged that no further word
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.200]   be spoken to them.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.760]   For they could not bear the command
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.040]   if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.800]   "I am full of fear and trembling."
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.320]   But you have come to Mount Zion
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.720]   and to the city of the living God,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.540]   the heavenly Jerusalem and to myriads of angels,
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.880]   to the general assembly and church of the firstborn
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   who are enrolled in heaven and to God, the judge of all
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.600]   and to the spirit of the righteous made perfect
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.680]   and to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.840]   and to the sprinkle blood which speaks better
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.480]   than the blood of Abel.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.320]   Let's pray.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.060]   Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.200]   to be able to come before your throne of grace
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.740]   with confidence because of the blood of Christ.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.960]   We thank you, Father God, for loving us,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.480]   persevering with us and at times correcting us,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.640]   disciplining us that we may know you,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.840]   that we may honor you and worship you.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.520]   We pray that your word would go forth,
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.760]   only your word go forth and that it would not return
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.440]   until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.080]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:27.040]   I think as you guys know, we are in wedding season, right?
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.940]   So we have so many weddings and we know some of you
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.160]   recently got married and we know that some of you
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   just got engaged, there's weddings coming up.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.840]   In fact, just this week we had two weddings.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   We had one here yesterday and then we had another one
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.160]   I think on Tuesday and so our pastors are busy
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.940]   officiating weddings and so through the years,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.760]   I think in our church we have so many young people,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.120]   we've had so many weddings and somebody asked me
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.020]   how many weddings have I officiated
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.840]   and I actually sat down and counted
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.240]   and it's been a while since I counted
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   but it's over 100 and less than 150.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.000]   So it was quite a few, right?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.440]   And there's more weddings going on now than ever.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.600]   But sometimes when we have weddings,
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.520]   we get so caught up in the logistics of the wedding
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.760]   that by the time they get to the wedding ceremony,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.600]   it's kind of like let's get this over with.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.960]   Get this over with and then let's go to the honeymoon
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.660]   and enjoy ourselves and they don't actually enjoy
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.140]   the ceremony which is obviously nobody plans to do that
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.500]   but they get caught up and they forget
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.020]   why they're getting married in the first place.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.660]   So through the years, I've observed.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.220]   I've officiated weddings that probably cost
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   less than a couple thousand.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   Then I've also officiated weddings
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.660]   where it costs almost half a million.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.140]   And so remembering all of those things like the highlights
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.740]   and whether it was an expensive wedding
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.220]   or whether it was a inexpensive wedding,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.820]   there are certain things that I can look back
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.820]   and remember what made it memorable.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.220]   And there's a few things that I remember.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:10.220]   One, it's obvious is that what makes a wedding memorable
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.300]   to me is that those two people wanted to be together.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.260]   It sounds like no duh, right?
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.300]   Why are they getting married?
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.220]   And so oftentimes, especially if you're in a Christian
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.620]   for a while, you have a Christian answer
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.060]   and then you have the real answer, right?
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.980]   So you ask, why do you want to get married?
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.140]   For the glory of God.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.220]   Like we want to produce and do God's work together.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.180]   And so you kind of give a Christian answer
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.740]   but the real honest reason is because she's pretty
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.740]   and he's good looking, right?
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.980]   There's something about each other that attracted you
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.020]   and you want to get married.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.340]   Nobody twisted your arm.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.500]   This was not an obligation.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.340]   If you want to honor God, you have to get married, right?
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.580]   It's a choice you made because you'd rather be
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.660]   with that person and not to be with that person.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.660]   So the obvious reason is because you want to.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.220]   And so of course, everybody gets married for that purpose
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.620]   but then they get caught up in the context
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.820]   of like trying to get the logistics and the guest rights
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.380]   and the food and all this stuff.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.980]   And then you got the drama between the in-laws
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.700]   and like who wants this and who doesn't want this.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.260]   And by the time they get to the wedding,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.260]   they completely forget about why they're getting married
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.460]   in the first place, right?
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.980]   Just let's get this over with.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980]   I'm so tired of this.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.340]   And then they go to their honeymoon.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.380]   So the weddings that I remember where they just,
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.220]   they never lost focus and they're just so happy to be there
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.320]   and all the little things that didn't go right,
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.620]   it didn't bother them as much
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.700]   because they get to get married to their,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.280]   you know, the person that they want to get married to.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.780]   So that's one of the first things that I remember.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.300]   The other part, especially for Christians,
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.220]   is was it genuine worship, right?
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.940]   Where I, you know, every once in a while
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.680]   we'll have a situation where just get this over with.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.760]   You know, the real wedding is the party,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.600]   like the reception.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.160]   We want to get to the reception
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.440]   so that we can celebrate, have good food.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.360]   And so the ceremony itself is just kind of get it over with.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.920]   Keep the sermon as short as possible.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   We don't want any frills, nothing.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.320]   Just get it over with, right?
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.360]   And then to get to that.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.320]   But the weddings that was truly memorable
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.880]   where the bride and groom came in
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.120]   really wanting to worship God.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.400]   And you can see, and then that's kind of like a catalyst
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.800]   for the wedding party to worship.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.200]   And then it really felt like worship
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.880]   in the context of the wedding ceremony.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   And I've had non-Christians who are witness to.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.080]   That's why one of the things that when I officiate weddings
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.360]   I want to make sure that the gospel is clearly presented
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.480]   is because I've had so many non-Christians
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.560]   come to me after a worship ceremony
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.780]   'cause they've never been to worship.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.480]   They've never been to church.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.000]   And they can't pinpoint exactly what it is,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.700]   but they knew that this was something that they're missing.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.120]   You know, if non-Christians fell short of the glory of God,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.600]   that's the primary thing that they're not able to do.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.400]   And so at least being in the midst of this celebration,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.840]   they noticed that this is something that was beautiful
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.480]   that they're not able to participate in.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.280]   And so genuine worship,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.480]   that you don't get so caught up in the logistics
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.240]   that you forget that this is a worship before God.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.800]   Before we ask for blessings of family and friends,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.240]   that we're asking for God's blessing.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.540]   And that was at the center.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.760]   And then the third, the final thing I remember
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.100]   about what was memorable to me was the gathering of people
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.360]   who were there to truly celebrate together.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.600]   I've been to weddings where the parents are very influential
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.760]   and they have so many friends
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.960]   and the wedding has like five, six, 700 people
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.360]   and more than half or maybe two thirds
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.600]   are guests from parents.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.560]   And so some of them come because they genuinely saw you
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.900]   grow up and they want to participate
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.940]   and then some of them come out of obligation.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.980]   Oh, he came to my wedding,
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.540]   so I have to invite them to our wedding.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.260]   So they gave 100, I'll give 100.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.500]   And so they have a lot of that dynamic going on
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.920]   and in order to not be cussed out,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.820]   they get the honored seats in the front
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.380]   and then the friends get the back seat
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.060]   and then they go through the motion and they feed them
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.060]   and then they leave.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.020]   They're the first ones to leave
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.980]   because they've shown their face, given their gift,
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.380]   they've eaten, they're gone.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.920]   And then they wait until their friends in the back,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.880]   can you come to the front
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.960]   so we can start this real ceremony?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.160]   And so I've been to weddings like that
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.840]   where they're just kind of appeasing people who are there
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.880]   but just not genuinely celebrating what's happening.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.000]   And so those are the three things that stand out to me,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.560]   like what was memorable to a wedding.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.960]   So husband and wife, they're there,
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.920]   like that's their focus.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.280]   They really are happy that they're getting married
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.320]   and two, worship was at the center
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.640]   and third, there was a genuine celebration
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.360]   of what's going on.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.280]   Now all of this is connected to the text
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.960]   that we're looking at because Mount Zion
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.540]   is described as a celebration.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.440]   If you look at Hebrews chapter 12, 22 in the NASB,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.040]   it doesn't really flesh out the meaning behind it
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.400]   because it just says it's an assembly
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.220]   of myriads of angels, a general assembly.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.080]   That word general assembly has more significance
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.320]   than what it says in the NASB.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.760]   NASB is just literally, if you translate it,
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.840]   that's what it means.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.120]   But if you look at the ESV,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.800]   and I'm gonna also read the NIV, it says this.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.240]   But you have come to Mount Zion
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.480]   and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.120]   and to innumerable angels in festal gathering.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.080]   And then in Hebrews 12, 22 NIV,
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.220]   but you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.560]   the city of the living God,
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.440]   you have come to thousands upon thousands
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.240]   of angels in joyful assembly.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.800]   Do you notice what's different between the NASB
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   and the NIV and the ESV?
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.760]   Did you catch that?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.720]   Where the NASB just says general assembly.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.640]   It just seems like, you know what I mean,
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.080]   you're having a town hall meeting
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.360]   or you're getting together, we're gonna clean the church,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.560]   we're just, everybody assemble, right?
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.880]   We're having a members meeting after this,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.340]   so that's also an assembly, general assembly.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.200]   The meaning behind this is actually fleshed out
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.320]   in the ESV and NIV.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.760]   It's not just any gathering, it is a celebration.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.160]   That's why it's called a festal gathering.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.660]   That is why it's called, again, in NIV, a joyful assembly.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.200]   So the description here is more akin to
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.260]   like a wedding ceremony, where there is an assembly,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.840]   but the assembly is for the purpose of celebration.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.340]   And that's how Zion is described here.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.060]   It is not just an assembly.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.360]   It's not just people, you know,
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.400]   we saved you from eternal damnation,
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.440]   so we're just gonna, everybody who's not condemned,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.640]   just gather here.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.320]   It's described as a joyful assembly.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.000]   In fact, the word for gospel, right,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.400]   what is the Greek word for gospel?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.880]   Euangelion.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.520]   And what is the meaning of that word, euangelion?
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.120]   Good news.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.680]   When we use the term good news,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.640]   we apply it to pretty much everything, right?
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.040]   They're having a half-off sale at some boba shop.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.280]   That's good news, right?
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.040]   Or you get let go of a ticket.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.880]   That's good news.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.400]   So we use the term good news for anything good,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.140]   but the word good news here in euangelion,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.380]   culturally was a very specific word.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.680]   It wasn't just something that was good versus bad.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.080]   That word, culturally, was specifically used
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.680]   to convey to us the meaning of the gospel.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.520]   Culturally, it was not the only way it was used,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.040]   but one of the primary ways that it was used
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.000]   was when the soldiers of your country went to war,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.280]   and people are eagerly waiting to see who won.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.040]   Because if the soldiers representing your nation
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.800]   to protect and to fight for you, if they lost,
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.160]   there would be immediate consequence
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.920]   that your children, mother, daughters,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.280]   they would be taken into captivity,
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.080]   and they may become slaves the rest of their lives.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.120]   So it wasn't just their livelihood or just their pride.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.360]   And so it was eager waiting to see if you won.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.400]   And so when they win, and they come back,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.320]   and they would celebrate, they would come back
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.800]   and say, I have good news, right?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   Good news.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.080]   So culturally, the meaning of good news
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   isn't just something good versus bad.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.280]   This is fantastic news.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.560]   It's kind of like the news that would break out into a parade.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.480]   And just like if you've seen video clips maybe on YouTube
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.640]   after World War II, the US conquers their enemies,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.480]   and they would come back and have a huge parade.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.040]   And that's the kind of idea that this word euangelion has.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:47.280]   So the very word itself has the idea of celebration.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.600]   Fantastic news.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   Jesus himself, in John 10.10, in the description
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.280]   of why he came, he says, "The thief comes only
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.920]   to steal and to kill and to destroy.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.120]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.740]   And you know the difference in the Greek
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.360]   between the word bios and zoe.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.040]   Bios is biology, where we get the word biology.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.760]   It means the length of life, right?
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   He didn't come so that we could live forever,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.720]   because we all live forever.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.080]   Whether you're a Christian or non-Christian, we have souls,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.640]   we have spirits that will live forever.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.840]   It's just the difference between will it be in heaven
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.960]   or will it be in hell.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.160]   That's the distinction.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.280]   So he's not saying that he came so that you can exist forever.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.240]   The word here used is zoe, where we get the word to be alive,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.000]   where you can be living and not be alive, right?
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.120]   And that's exactly what happened at the fall.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.400]   Soon as they disobeyed God, zoe is what they lost.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.240]   Bios kept on going.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.160]   So he describes his very ministry.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.760]   And that's why he says he came to give zoe
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.320]   and to have it abundantly.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.280]   In other words, to celebrate, to restore the joy that
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.440]   was extinguished because of sin.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.560]   In fact, in Matthew 22, 1 through 14,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:10.280]   Jesus compares the kingdom of God to a wedding feast,
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.520]   to the wedding feast.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.600]   Verse 1 through 14, where he went out and invited people
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.960]   to come to his son's wedding, and people would say no.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.280]   And then that's the whole parable
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.240]   that he gives, that the kingdom of God is like a wedding feast.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.120]   So Zion, in this text, is a description,
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.760]   not simply of a gathering, but of a wedding celebration,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.040]   that people are being gathered for the purpose of experiencing
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:44.080]   this joy, this zoe, that was lost because of the fall.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   So when we think about the wedding,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.200]   and I know that there are some of you who've just
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.660]   experienced it, and some of you who
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.200]   are in the middle of doing that, what's
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.440]   the first thing that you're concerned about when
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.800]   you're preparing for a wedding?
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.280]   Venue.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.080]   Where are you going to get married?
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.480]   Well, the venue is taken care of.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.440]   It's Zion.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.980]   Venue is taken care of, so it's Zion.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.920]   So what's the second thing that you're concerned about?
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.360]   Guest list.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.880]   Who's coming to this?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.280]   And so we're talking about this celebration,
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.600]   this wedding feast that's described in Mount Zion.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.000]   And so we know what the venue is.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.660]   It's at Zion, right?
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.060]   It's a spiritual Jerusalem.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.900]   But the guest list is what he describes here.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.860]   Who's going to be at the celebration?
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.860]   And so the first guests that are there,
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.560]   people who are there in celebration,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.460]   it says there are myriads of angels.
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.060]   Why are the angels the first ones on this list?
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.100]   Remember when we were studying Hebrews chapter 1 many,
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.060]   many years ago, those of you who were here?
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:51.400]   He begins Hebrews chapter 1, description of all the things
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.080]   and all the people that Jesus Christ is superior over.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.760]   So he just goes down the list.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.740]   He's superior than Moses, more than the covenant,
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.380]   the high priest, the sacrifice itself.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.000]   But what does he begin with?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.120]   Do you remember Hebrews chapter 1?
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.560]   Angels, right, those of you who remember.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.600]   He starts the list of all the things
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.280]   that Jesus is superior over, and he starts at the very top.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.320]   Angels.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.560]   So I'm not going to revisit this sermon
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.400]   in why this was significant, but the angels
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.920]   were so venerated in the Jewish mind.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.000]   It says in Colossians 2.18 that some of them
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.280]   were actually guilty of worshiping them.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.840]   So it naturally had a sense of-- they
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.760]   had a sense of awe and respect for the angels,
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.520]   and rightfully so, because the angels
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.080]   were very powerful beings.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   In fact, at Mount Sinai, when the law was given,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   the angels were present, the Bible says.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   The angels were so powerful, in Genesis chapter 19, verse 13,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.560]   when God brings judgment upon the nation of--
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.600]   upon Sodom and Gomorrah, only two angels
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.320]   were needed to wipe them out.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.000]   In 2 Kings 19.35, this--
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.600]   whenever we talk about the Assyrians,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   they were the scary people who went and conquered
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.020]   and were so brutal.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.040]   When God brought judgment upon the Assyrians,
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.880]   it only required one angel to wipe out 185,000 soldiers.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.680]   One angel.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.640]   So naturally, they were very powerful beings.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.040]   And so whenever humans encountered angels,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   their natural inclination was to bow down and worship.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.080]   So there are many instances in the Bible
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.960]   where the angels have to stop them,
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.420]   and say, do not worship me, because I
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.140]   don't want to be judged.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.220]   That's exactly what Satan wanted.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.700]   Satan wanted to be worshipped.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.580]   And so whenever people would bow down
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.180]   because they see something so much greater than them,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.260]   they would have to stop and say, I'm just an angel.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.420]   I'm a creative being just like you.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   Why is this significant?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.460]   It's significant because this wedding ceremony
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.060]   is a king's ceremony.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.300]   If somebody invited you to a wedding ceremony,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.980]   and you found out that all the superstars of this generation
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.940]   is going to be there, you're naturally
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.300]   going to want to be there.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.740]   You're naturally going to be all your favorite sports, all
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.500]   your favorite movie stars, all your favorite scientists,
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.140]   whatever it is that you look up to.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.980]   So they're all going to be there.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.980]   And so for that reason, he's saying the angels--
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.100]   it's not just one or two, myriads.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.580]   Myriads literally is translated thousands.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.540]   That doesn't seem like a lot.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.140]   Those of you who are a little bit older,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.580]   when we were younger, when we described somebody rich,
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.820]   what did we say?
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.300]   He's a millionaire.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.340]   Today, if you own a home in Orange County,
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.860]   you might be a millionaire.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.900]   For sure, if you own a home in San Jose, you're a millionaire.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.340]   Today, if we want to describe somebody very rich,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.060]   we say multimillionaire or a billionaire.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.260]   Because millionaire just doesn't have the same ring.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.940]   And obviously, because the way we use the term now
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.540]   just has lost its significance.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.660]   So at this particular time, in order
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.800]   to describe something great in number,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.460]   they would say thousands or thousands upon thousands.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.660]   And so what he is saying here is that there
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.420]   is countless number of angels who will be present here.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.700]   In other words, right off the bat,
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.700]   is to convey the significance of this event.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.140]   When you get to Zion, there's going
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.740]   to be myriads of angels that are going
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.460]   to be there in celebration.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.780]   Revelations 5, 11, 14 is a specific description
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.260]   of what he says here in Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.660]   He says, "Then I looked, and I heard
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.900]   the voice of many angels around the throne,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.060]   and the living creatures, and the elders, and a number of them
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.900]   was myriads upon myriads, and thousands upon thousands,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.940]   saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.820]   and honor, and glory, and blessing.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.220]   Every creative thing which is in heaven, and on earth,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.180]   and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things in them,
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.980]   I heard saying, to him who sits on the throne, and to the lamb,
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.940]   be blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion forever
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.540]   and ever.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.740]   And the four living creatures kept saying, amen,
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.980]   and the elders fell down and worshipped."
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.100]   That's the same scene that's being described here
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.780]   in Hebrews chapter 12, verse 22, where
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.300]   there's going to be this festival, this joyful gathering,
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.460]   this wedding feast, where myriads of angels
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.700]   are going to be gathered together.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.660]   But you notice how in Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:44.740]   22, that this gathering is going to be a joyful, festal
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:51.020]   gathering, but the same scene is described here as worship?
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.020]   You notice that?
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:58.420]   That joy and worship is used interchangeably.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   Now, if you don't have that idea of worship,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.100]   it's just like worship, like what time is worship?
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.860]   Especially if you grew up in the church,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.100]   and worship has become a habit, you
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.700]   don't think of worship as joy.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.860]   You think of it as time.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.100]   What time is worship?
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.900]   When is this worship over?
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:24.180]   This idea of worship is something that we do to attend.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.860]   But the biblical concept of worship is joy.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.140]   What time do we come to celebrate?
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.660]   That's the idea of worship.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.540]   So therefore, a Christian who is constantly grumbling
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:41.540]   cannot be in worship, because worship, by definition,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.580]   is to celebrate.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.420]   You can't be celebrating if you're constantly
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.380]   grumbling about something.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.300]   So if you notice here, worship and joy
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.980]   are described interchangeably.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.660]   We worship what causes the greatest joy in our life,
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.700]   do we not?
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.860]   Because the word worship comes from the Latin word
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.500]   "we are scipe," and it means to give worth to something.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.700]   That's the very definition of the English word worship.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:15.220]   We see value in it, so therefore, we give praise.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.900]   So we naturally end up worshiping
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.660]   what brings the greatest joy.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.540]   If God is not the producer of the greatest joy in your life,
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.700]   you're going to see God as an obligation,
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.220]   and then something else.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.300]   Get this worship over with.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.180]   A lot of people get very frustrated
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.780]   if my sermon goes over, and not at this church.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.100]   If it goes over at certain times, like I've allowed you
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:53.020]   40 minutes, 45 minutes, and I'll be gracious 50 minutes,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.580]   if you're insensitive, there's nothing
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.860]   you're going to say that's important enough to listen
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.140]   over 50 minutes.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.460]   And so I get kind of scowls, and I can see it on your faces
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.340]   sometimes.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.820]   Most of you are good.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.660]   Some of you are not.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.100]   As soon as I go over that allotted grace
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.020]   that you've given me, and it's like I've ruined your life
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.980]   because you have plans.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.620]   You've got to go eat with your friends,
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.300]   and you're supposed to do something.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   But what produces the greatest joy is not necessarily worship.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.860]   It's just this is something that has to be done,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.500]   and then so that we can get to what produces joy.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.260]   But true worship is directly linked
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.820]   to what brings the greatest joy.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.020]   And if worship is what causes the greatest joy,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.900]   whatever causes the greatest joy is constantly on our mind.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:54.900]   Those of you who are sports fans, if you're a Dodgers fan--
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.980]   is Dodgers playing today?
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.220]   I have no idea, because I'm not a big Dodgers fan.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.860]   If you're a Dodgers fan, you probably know.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.220]   And you probably know the stats of the people who are playing.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.180]   You probably know how they played the last game.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.020]   You probably know their standing.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.220]   You probably know what they have to do in order
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.020]   for them to advance.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.100]   And you get frustrated and happy based
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.040]   upon how your team does, because it produces
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.900]   a great amount of joy.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.180]   Whatever that causes the greatest amount of joy
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.740]   is on our mind constantly.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.740]   You don't have to be reminded.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.060]   In fact, you get frustrated when other fans don't know.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.060]   You call yourself a Dodgers fan, and you don't know?
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.420]   You're not angry that they lost?
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.420]   What's wrong with you?
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.580]   Whatever causes the greatest joy is on your mind constantly.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.540]   And if it causes the greatest joy in your life,
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.660]   you end up sharing it.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.100]   This has nothing to do with being
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.700]   an extrovert and an introvert.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.040]   Oh, I'm not good at witnessing, because I'm an introvert.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.900]   I've never seen an introvert who keeps their greatest
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.180]   passions to themselves.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.780]   You may not be screaming it, but your wife, your children
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.100]   know exactly what you like and don't like.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.180]   You don't have to say it.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.220]   They know it.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.860]   So if that's your greatest joy, you end up sharing it.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.540]   You go out, and you love this movie.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.200]   You probably told your friends about it.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.700]   They know about it.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.460]   So whatever produces the greatest joy,
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.980]   it ends up leaking.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.500]   You end up telling other people about it,
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.180]   because they say, oh, that makes that guy so happy.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.460]   And so you end up becoming a witness.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.100]   And whatever is creating the greatest joy in your life,
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.740]   automatically, you feel a community with other people
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.620]   that loves the same thing.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.620]   So if you're a Dodgers fan, my guess
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.860]   is you're in some sort of a chat room with other Dodgers fans.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.480]   And when you're sad, you're sad together.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.300]   When you're happy, you're happy together.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.680]   And you celebrate.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.220]   And the people in that room, you may not even
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.980]   know the other parts of their life.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   All you know is that the same thing causes joy in your life.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.620]   And so community happens.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.340]   So if you're at church, and you have a church filled
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.660]   with people whose not--
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.100]   the greatest joy is not Christ, you
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.060]   have to produce a community with artificial things.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.200]   We have a rock climbing church-- rock climbing fellowship
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.780]   at the church.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.180]   So anybody who's rock climbing, let's get together.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.340]   Anybody who's older than 50, we're
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.680]   going to have a community there.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.100]   Anybody who likes water or whatever.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.980]   I don't have a lot of hobbies.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.780]   That's all.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:45.100]   Like fishing or-- so you have to create this artificial love
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.460]   that's not Christ to get together,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.180]   because that's the connection.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.200]   But if you have true, true joy from, let's say,
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.940]   playing Dodgers, do you have an age limit there?
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.520]   Is that, oh, we're going to have a chat room for Dodgers fans,
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.260]   but you have to be 30 and over.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.860]   You have to have this kind of income.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.460]   You have to have this kind of hobbies.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.780]   No, the only criteria is you love Dodgers.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.140]   And whoever loves Dodgers, whether you are 13-year-old
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.300]   or a 70-year-old, the fact that you
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.500]   are sharing this joy together produces this community.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.060]   And so the church is a gathering of place
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.460]   that have people who have seen the glory of the gospel
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.620]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.180]   And loving Christ, proclaiming Christ
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.460]   produces the greatest joy, and the community happens.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.340]   That's what happened in the early church
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:39.740]   with the Jews, the Gentiles, the tax collectors, the fishermen,
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.100]   the educated, uneducated, slave owners, and former slaves.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.980]   They all gathered together because the same thing
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.260]   produces joy in them.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:53.220]   Whatever causes the greatest joy is the source
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.380]   of the greatest community.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.300]   That's why our primary goal is to proclaim Christ.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.220]   Because if you love Christ, this gathering
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.740]   is not so that we can produce a false sense of unity
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.340]   because we have things in common.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.500]   We went to the same school.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.420]   We're the same age.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.380]   We speak the same language, same culture.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.460]   We eat the same food.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.100]   It's so superficial.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.500]   But what's unique about the church
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.780]   is that no matter what background, no matter where
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.420]   you came from, no matter how different we were before we
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.080]   came in together, what causes the greatest joy in our lives
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.220]   is the same.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.580]   And that's what produces a true community.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.620]   Fifthly, whatever produces the greatest joy in our life,
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.420]   we are more than willing to pay the most price for.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.220]   Again, if you're a Dodgers fan and they're at the World Series
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.660]   and even though you're struggling financially,
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.140]   you will sell your car if you have to.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.300]   If you're a true fan, to get the best seats.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.700]   Because it produces the greatest joy in your life.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.540]   You're willing to pay whatever the cost is.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.540]   And not because you are more disciplined than other people,
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.220]   because you're more noble.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.100]   It's because it produces the greatest joy.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.940]   And because it produces the greatest joy,
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.420]   you're willing to pay the highest price.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.980]   So when Jesus says to pick up your cross,
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.180]   it's not just a cross, oh, we've got to bear,
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.180]   we've got to suffer for Jesus Christ.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.900]   But it produces the greatest joy.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.620]   And that's how it's described in Matthew chapter 13 to 46.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.260]   He says, "The kingdom of heaven is
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.340]   like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.340]   and hid again.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.060]   And from joy over it, goes and sells all that he has
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.860]   and buys that field."
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.420]   And then again, he says in verse 45,
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.740]   "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.060]   fine pearls.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.040]   And upon finding one pearl of great value,
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.740]   he went and sold all that he had and bought it."
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.700]   There are two things I want to emphasize here.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.300]   One, the reason why they were willing to pay
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.020]   the ultimate price, sell everything for that,
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.020]   is because they saw the value.
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.740]   They saw the value of what they found.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.900]   And if a Christian either forgets or distracted
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.980]   and are more tempted by the things of this world,
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.340]   and we forget what it is that we have in Christ,
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.540]   worship is faked.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.860]   Because worship happens as a result
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.700]   of seeing the value of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.780]   And you notice, because he knew the value,
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.940]   what was his motivation?
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.780]   Joy.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.700]   So his sacrifice wasn't sacrifice.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.940]   He was trading something that is of lesser value
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.340]   or something of greater value.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.540]   So he was investing for the future.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:47.300]   But the primary motivation was joy.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.460]   And what produced joy is because they recognized the value.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.660]   That's the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.300]   That's why the Bible says that the God of this age
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.900]   has blinded the mind of the unbelievers
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.300]   so they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   So they don't see the value in Christ.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.340]   They don't see the value of this good news.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.100]   It's just news.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.740]   It's just one of many information.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.980]   But a Christian is one whose eyes have been opened
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.620]   and have seen the ultimate value of God.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.380]   And as a result of that, they're willing to sell everything
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.020]   that they have.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.860]   They're willing to give their life in order
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.500]   to have what is given to us.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.300]   So in John chapter 15, verse 11, if you know that passage,
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.300]   John chapter 11 is the passage where Jesus gives the I
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.220]   am divine and you are the branches
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.740]   and you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.660]   If you abide in me, my word's abiding in you.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.620]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be given to you.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.900]   And it is in that text he says in verse 11,
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.740]   these things I have spoken to you so that what?
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:56.060]   My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.780]   The joy that he has so that you can have it.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.700]   And so if we don't understand the value of what
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.780]   it is that we have in Christ, his imperative--
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.500]   so oftentimes people say, oh man,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.700]   when we talk about the grace of God, the love of God,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.020]   how it's unconditional and it causes joy
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   because we have this unconditional love of God.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.660]   And then when we talk about imperatives,
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.460]   about picking up the cross and sacrificing suffering
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.860]   for the name of Jesus, man, that's heavy.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.220]   Man, what a downer.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.620]   But he says here the reason why he gives the indicatives
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.660]   and the reason why he gives imperatives
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.820]   is for the same reason, so that we may have joy.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.780]   He tells us to pick up our cross because he's
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.500]   trying to produce in us the joy that he has.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.700]   It's for that joy.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.860]   That's why in Hebrews chapter 11, 15 to 16,
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.020]   all these people who have sacrificed everything
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.540]   because of the promise that God gave,
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.500]   indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.860]   went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   But as it is, they desire a better country
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.260]   that is a heavenly one.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.500]   Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.460]   for he has prepared a city for them.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.380]   So the reason-- if our joy comes from something
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.780]   that this world produces, then naturally you're
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.860]   going to pursue this world.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.500]   And you can't help it, because if you
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.300]   see that whatever it is that you want,
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.260]   you find fulfillment is in this world,
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:33.020]   then God kind of is a hindrance to that.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.220]   God becomes a hindrance.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.260]   Even though you proclaim to be a Christian,
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.540]   if what you value is something that you
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.380]   can attain in this world, then you're
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.840]   going to do everything in your power
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.460]   to pursue what's in this world.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.700]   And God is going to be a hindrance to that.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.260]   So you want just enough God so that you
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:54.140]   can have insurance for eternity, but God is not your pursuit.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.180]   God is just somebody to help you pursue this.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.100]   And you realize after time goes by that that's not
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.540]   what God wants for you.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.140]   So you end up choosing.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.700]   If God's not going to give me this, I don't want him.
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.340]   And so that's part of the reason why so many people drift
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.340]   and so many people choose to walk away from God.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.860]   It's not because at one point in their life
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.940]   God disappointed them.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.660]   From the get-go, God is not what they wanted.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.460]   They wanted something from God, but it is not
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.860]   God that they wanted.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.420]   See, worship to many people is nothing more
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.740]   than putting their time in.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.340]   Worship at Berlin Community Church happens at 9 o'clock,
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.740]   and then it happens at 11 o'clock.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.180]   And I permitted hour and a half.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.220]   Don't go over hour and a half, because after an hour and a half
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.100]   you're ruining my life.
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:43.940]   I have schedules.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.980]   I have lunch appointments.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.140]   I got things I got to do.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:49.740]   But the biblical definition of worship
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.300]   is where we come to receive life in the presence of the only one
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.620]   who can give life.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.620]   And so in John chapter 4, 21 to 23,
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.180]   I'm not going to read the whole passage where he has this
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.660]   encounter with the Samaritan woman.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.940]   She recognizes that he is no ordinary person.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.220]   And he said, you Jews want to worship in this mountain,
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.060]   we worship in that mountain.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.500]   We have different opinions of where we should worship.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.900]   And it is to that response he says, what God is looking for
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.540]   is true worshipers.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.780]   Whether you worship in this mountain or that mountain,
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:23.060]   whether it's 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock, that's not the point.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.340]   What God is looking for are people who will worship Him
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.220]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.220]   True worship.
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.180]   People who are coming to God because they
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:38.340]   recognize the value of what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.580]   And that's why the Bible is filled with the word,
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.300]   remember, remember, remember the height from which you had
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.060]   formed.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.420]   Remember when you first heard the gospel.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.660]   Remember in the beginning of your faith
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.260]   where that meant everything to you.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:57.460]   If you've drifted from that, spiritual maturity
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.020]   is not knowing more.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.700]   It's not finding out the deep mysteries
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.460]   that you can only find it by reading so many books.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.740]   Spiritual maturity is remembering
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.820]   what you had from day one.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.260]   Everything that you needed for life and Godliness
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.540]   has been given to you in the knowledge of His Son Jesus
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.660]   Christ.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.940]   And that's why he says, remember, repeatedly,
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.660]   over and over.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.820]   Because God is looking for people
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:27.980]   who are worshiping Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.820]   And that should be the goal and is
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.300]   the goal of every single church.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.260]   We don't call a church a successful church
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.660]   because we have more people than the church down the street.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.620]   We're better programmed or better preaching
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.900]   or better whatever it is that we think the church is.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:49.500]   A good church and a bad church, the distinction is worship.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.420]   Are people worshiping in spirit and in truth?
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.740]   Or are they just checking in and checking out?
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.460]   Because that's what God is looking for.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.980]   Man may look for the human product.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:04.220]   What God is looking for is true worship.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.500]   And that's why he says, myriads and myriads.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.380]   But second, this is the gathering
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.620]   of the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:16.620]   When we say church, there's always two parts.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.300]   There's a universal church and the local church.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:24.700]   The universal church is God's program, God's membership.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.740]   And only God knows, true people who genuinely know God.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.020]   You and I do not have the power to discern.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.140]   The Bible says there's wheat in the tares.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.980]   So as long as we're here physically,
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:41.220]   there will always be some wheat and tares in the church.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.260]   He's going to discern at the end who they are.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.900]   So even at the best of our celebration,
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.180]   it's always going to have some mix in the church,
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.780]   some people who genuinely love Christ and want to meet Christ.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.940]   And that's all they want.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.540]   And then there's going to be people in the church who
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:05.900]   don't fit in because their primary goal is not God.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.380]   There's all the things that's going to be mixed in.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.660]   But the celebration that you and I are going to experience
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.620]   when we get to Zion is going to be pure celebration.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.100]   There's no Poser Dodger fans.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.940]   They're only there when they win.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.940]   Oh, I want some of that.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:26.540]   And they come, but then they don't suffer with you.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.540]   They don't invest with you.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.740]   And so the church has both.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.660]   And so we want to preach in a way
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.540]   that those who don't have genuine faith wake up,
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.380]   and hopefully that the true gospel causes
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.460]   them to come to Christ.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.140]   So our celebration at best is always
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:49.220]   going to have some mixture in the church.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:53.020]   But in Zion, he says it's going to be perfect.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.740]   Only true fans of Christ are going to be there.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.100]   So when we celebrate, we're going
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.780]   to be around other people who are going
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.020]   to be celebrating with us.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.660]   And I think if you're a sports fan,
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.860]   you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.660]   If your team wins and you just happen
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.140]   to be with other people who is a true fan-- not a bandwagoner,
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.820]   but a true fan--
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:20.980]   you know the joy, the celebration, the koinonia
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.500]   that you feel.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.100]   You know nothing about that person.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.340]   They may be from rival gangs sitting next to each other.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.820]   And they're hugging each other, celebrating, high-fiving,
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.260]   because it's pure worship.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.220]   In heaven, we're going to experience that pure joy.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.820]   Because he's going to separate the wheat and the tares.
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.500]   And only true worshipers of God are
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.300]   going to gather together worshiping.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.740]   No one's going to be bored there.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.180]   No one's falling asleep there.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.940]   No one is tired over there.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.380]   It's going to be pure worship.
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.940]   In Revelation 7, 9 through 10, it
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.900]   said, "After these things, I looked and behold,
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.180]   great multitude, which no one could count,
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.780]   from every nation and all the tribes and the people
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.980]   and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.460]   clothed in white robes and palm branches,
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.420]   were in their hands.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.260]   And they cry out with a loud voice, saying,
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.020]   'Salvation to our God, who sits on the throne,
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.380]   and to the Lamb!'"
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:24.860]   If you are not a true worshiper of God, that sounds boring.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:33.700]   Worship's not going to end at 1215.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.620]   It's like, I gave you 45 minutes.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:39.060]   This is eternity.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.140]   If you are not a true worshiper of God,
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.860]   this is not something to look forward to.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.020]   Are you kidding?
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.980]   That's why non-Christians always say, "Ah, heaven's boring.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:51.620]   I want to go to hell so that I can party with people like me."
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.300]   Hell is not described as a party.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.220]   In Hebrews chapter 12, too, that's
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.140]   why it says, "Fix our eyes on Jesus, the author
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   and perfecter of our faith.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:07.180]   For the joy set before Him endured the cross."
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.940]   He didn't go to the cross because He
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.500]   was attracted to the cross.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:17.180]   He said He put up with the cross in order to have joy.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.420]   Now, what is this joy He's referring to?
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.260]   Something about me and you.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.780]   Because that's why He didn't have it this side of the cross.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.900]   He was willing to endure the cross so
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:34.940]   that He can have joy in us, and that we can have joy in Him.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.980]   That's the purpose of the cross.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.820]   It's not like, hey, here's a bunch of things
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.540]   that you should do.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.860]   Here's the 10 commandments.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.300]   And if you're a good person, you do these 10 things.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.620]   You wake up early in the morning,
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.980]   and you're just gritted and more disciplined than other people.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.220]   You're going to work harder than everybody else.
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.660]   And next thing you know, your joy is killed.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.100]   Again, there's nothing wrong with these things
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:03.220]   if that's our pursuit of joy, if that causes us to worship God
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.220]   more.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.700]   But if what we're doing as Christians
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.020]   is causing us to be bitter and angry and upset,
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.660]   it's the exact opposite of what God
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.780]   is trying to produce in us--
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.980]   true worship.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:25.460]   The best witness as a church is to become the best worshippers.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.260]   Because the non-Christians, when they come see us,
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.300]   and if what produces joy in us is no different than the world,
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.660]   there's no reason to come here.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.580]   If we're happy when we make money, and we're sad
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.420]   we don't make money, if we make good investments,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.980]   and we get sick and not get sick,
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.820]   and if the world sees that our joy is
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.700]   no different than what produced joy in them,
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.140]   there's no difference in us than them.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.860]   What's unique about our fellowship
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.980]   is what produces joy that the world does not understand.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.260]   Why are you so happy in the middle of a pandemic?
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.460]   Why are you so happy when your job is the way it is?
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.700]   Why are you so happy when you're so tired raising kids?
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.340]   What's different about you?
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:12.500]   What is producing that life and joy in you?
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.900]   And that causes us to say it's because of God, who does not
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.380]   fade, who does not perish, does not spoil.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:24.460]   Our salvation, our promise, our inheritance
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:29.540]   is preserved for us by the power of God until He comes.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.820]   So our joy and our worship is not like the world.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.260]   And that's the best witness.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.860]   A person who is not worshiping God and spirit and the truth,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.700]   and you try to share the gospel with somebody,
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.340]   all you're doing is regurgitating information.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.460]   You're not being a witness.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.180]   A witness is somebody who's seen life.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.180]   They've seen life.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:51.940]   They've seen joy.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.140]   This is where I get the joy.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.020]   This is where I feel I find life,
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.300]   and you want to share that with other people.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.180]   That's true worship.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.660]   That's what he is seeking for.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.960]   Let me get to the third thing, OK?
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.380]   And then the final part we're going to save for next week,
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.140]   because I don't want to go over 50 minutes.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.220]   I want you to be happy when we leave, all right?
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.460]   He says, millions of angels are going to be there.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:18.260]   This is the gathering of the true church, who's
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:22.220]   going to be worshiping together, and then God, the judge of all.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:28.180]   Why would you-- there's all kinds of things
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.340]   that you could describe God as.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.900]   God of love is going to be there.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.940]   God of eternal grace is going to be there.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.820]   God, the provider, is going to be there.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.060]   He says, no, God, the judge of all, is also going to be there.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.080]   Why does he ruin this with this description?
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.580]   There's all kinds of things that can be described.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.220]   But when the word judge--
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.700]   if I asked you to describe the word judge,
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.940]   what does the word judge mean?
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.620]   To discern right and wrong.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.020]   To discern right and wrong.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.660]   But why do we, when we hear the word judge,
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.420]   it's automatically negative?
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.020]   We say, judge, don't judge me.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.780]   Don't be judgmental.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.980]   God, the judge, and all of a sudden, what do we see?
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.340]   Mount Sinai.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.500]   I thought we were in Zion.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.860]   Why is God described as the God of Mount Sinai?
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.740]   The word judge, in and of itself,
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:30.540]   is a neutral word to discern right and wrong.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.060]   And it's not negative.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.780]   The reason why it produces a negative emotion
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.180]   is because there's something guilty in us.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.500]   A guilty person standing before a holy God,
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.360]   and you hear the word judge, immediately judgment
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.060]   is condemnation.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.740]   But those who have been covered by the blood of Christ,
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.140]   God, the judge, is our protector.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.700]   God, the judge, is our leader.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.660]   God, the judge, is our provider.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.380]   And that's what you and I need to remember
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.700]   when we get to heaven.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.100]   It's that God, the judge--
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.780]   and it's just like the way-- remember the book of Judges?
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.900]   The book of Judges, the theme is,
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.140]   everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.100]   And you notice there, it doesn't say everyone
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.420]   did what was wrong in their own eyes.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.860]   It said everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:26.220]   Some of the greatest sins that are committed in human history
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.660]   are committed by people who are convinced that they are right,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.620]   based on their own moral compass.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.740]   That's what's going on right now in our generation.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.020]   Everyone is proclaiming what they're doing is righteous.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.020]   And they're willing to do whatever it takes
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.220]   to get their point across.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.140]   And he says, the reason why Israel kept on falling
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:49.740]   is because everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.260]   And then as a result of that, the judgment would come.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.460]   And they would cry out to God.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.260]   And who would he raise?
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.180]   A judge.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.620]   That's why that book is called The Judges.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.820]   So the judge in nation's history was a deliverer.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.340]   Judge is the one who protected them.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.900]   Judge is the one that brought revival.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.820]   Judge is the one who brought righteousness
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.140]   in the nation of Israel.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.460]   So here, when he says, God, the judge, will be there.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.660]   For those who are unrepentant, is not
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.740]   covered by the blood of Christ.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.900]   Yes, the God, the judge, will bring condemnation.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.300]   We will have to give account of every sin, every careless word
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.820]   the Bible says.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.940]   And we will have to pay for that,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:34.140]   just like if you were to stand before a human judge.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.540]   But the judge that he's referring to here in Mount Zion
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.060]   are those who stand before a holy God
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:43.580]   and have been declared righteous because of the blood of Christ.
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.580]   He will protect us.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.580]   He will provide for us.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.340]   He will guide us.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.340]   He will lead us.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.540]   And righteousness will prevail because of the blood
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.140]   of Christ for eternity.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.260]   That's what he has called us to.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.180]   So this is a cause of celebration.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.740]   We're not here to put in our time.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.740]   We're not here to say, you know, I attended worship.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.460]   At least I went.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:09.820]   No, we came to celebrate.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.660]   That's what this is.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.820]   Worship is a time of celebrating,
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.020]   celebrating what God has done for us.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.740]   So again, I want to encourage you,
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.200]   and I want to ask you this question.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.460]   And as we take some time to pray,
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.300]   as we ask our worship team to come back up,
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.820]   when was the last time you really
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.340]   came to God seeking life?
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.700]   Now, I understand, like justification.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.700]   I came to God years ago, 10 years ago, 30 years ago,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.980]   40 years ago.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.740]   And I wanted life.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.580]   I wanted my sins to be justified by the blood of Christ.
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.460]   But when was the last time you came to Christ
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.500]   to experience this life, to have greater joy,
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.300]   to feel alive because of Christ?
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.220]   And if we've seen something in the world that produces joy,
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.580]   and then church just as a maintenance
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.740]   so that we can have insurance to go to heaven,
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:11.100]   you're completely missing the whole point of our existence,
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.280]   the purpose of our salvation, so that we
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.940]   may have this joy and have it to the fullest.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.980]   So my prayer and my encouragement
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:24.660]   is to see our gathering as the greatest place of joy.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.180]   Remember what it is that we have in Christ.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.240]   Remember the gift that we have.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.500]   And stop complaining that we're on this plane together
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.140]   to Zion and grumbling that you didn't
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.740]   get the first class seat.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.620]   I wanted to sit on the aisle.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.420]   How come they get to sit on the aisle?
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.620]   And you're on the coach seat, and you're
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:51.180]   coveting the people who are in the business class.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.580]   Why do they get business class?
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.540]   Because we've forgotten where we're going.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.660]   When we land, we're going to be in Zion.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.260]   Maybe God put you on the coach because there's
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:05.980]   people in the coach that you'll be celebrating with.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.700]   Maybe you're going to get greater reward
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.860]   because you're in the coach.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:11.060]   I don't know why we're in the coach.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.060]   But to be grumbling because we're in the coach,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.580]   because we're closer to the toilet?
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:20.620]   Think about where we're going.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:23.980]   Think about what's at the other side when we land.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:27.380]   Think about what's coming when Christ comes,
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.340]   so that we would learn to celebrate and have life here
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.820]   and have it abundantly.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.300]   Let's pray.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:40.220]   Again, as our worship team leads us,
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.180]   take some time to pray and reflect and let
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.820]   the word of God bear fruit in our hearts.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:50.300]   Make an honest confession before God.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.860]   God, I made you a task in my life, something
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.780]   that needs to be done.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.020]   And I've made the world my treasure.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.820]   Lord, help me.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:01.620]   I believe.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.580]   Help my unbelief.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.060]   I'm not able.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.500]   I need you.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.620]   Take some time to honestly confess before God.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.420]   Help me.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.660]   Open my eyes that I may see once again the treasure
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.420]   that I have in you so that I may worship you
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.380]   in spirit and in truth.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.820]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.

[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.500]   as we sing this last song, "How Great Is Our God."
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.460]   [MUSIC - "HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD"]
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:05.940]   The splendor.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.900]   The splendor of the King.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:18.900]   Clothed in majesty, let all the earth
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:24.780]   rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:28.260]   He wraps himself in love.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:39.260]   And darkness tries to hide and trembles at his voice,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.220]   trembles at his voice.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:48.500]   How great is our God.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:54.500]   Sing with me, how great is our God.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:13:02.460]   Oh, see how great, how great is our God.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:13.940]   And age to age he stands.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:21.940]   And time is in his hands, beginning and the end,
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.940]   beginning and the end.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:32.940]   The God of three in one.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:40.940]   Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the Lamb,
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.420]   the Lion and the Lamb.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.420]   Sing it out, how great.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:49.900]   How great is our God.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:55.900]   Sing with me, how great is our God.

[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:24.300]   And my heart will sing how great is our God.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.300]   One more time.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.300]   Say, name above all names.

[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.180]   Sing it out one more time.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.180]   How great.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:29.180]   How great is our God.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:35.180]   How great is our God.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.180]   How great.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:42.660]   How great is our God.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:53.140]   How great is our God.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:59.620]   Sing with me, how great is our God.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:08.100]   Oh, see how great, how great is our God.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:14.100]   And let's pray.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:19.580]   Revelation 5, 11-14, "Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne,
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.580]   and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads,
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.580]   and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:38.580]   And every created thing which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea,
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:44.580]   and all things in them, I heard saying, 'To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb,
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:48.580]   be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.'
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:55.580]   And the four living creatures kept saying, 'Amen,' and the elders fell down and worshipped."
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:02.580]   Lord, we pray that you would help us to be true worshippers in spirit and in truth,
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   wherever it is that you send us, beyond Sunday, beyond mornings of devotions,
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.580]   beyond times of prayer.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   Help us, Lord God, to be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us, especially in this dark age.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   May Christ's name be exalted this week.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   God sent his Son, they called him Jesus.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:45.580]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:56.580]   He lived and died to buy my poverty.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:07.580]   An empty grave is there to keep my Savior live.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:17.580]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:28.580]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:39.580]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
