[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Some other announcements I'd like to highlight is that the First John memorization study
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.980]   and practice that we've been taking signups for, today is the last day for that.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.560]   If you would like to participate in this, there is a link there.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.840]   If you have questions about it, you can reach out to Pastor Peter Chung directly.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.440]   But what a really fruitful thing to try to retain the scriptures into your heart, into
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.720]   your mind, and have it readily available, especially a book like First John, where as
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.200]   it talks about just the core of what genuine Christianity is, it'll be a great study.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.820]   So please sign up for that.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.120]   For all the men in the room, again, whether you're in high school or college, young adult,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.380]   married, we're having a men's prayer on Saturday, November 23rd at 8.30.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.500]   So please mark your calendar and come for that.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.080]   We would like to have a headcount, just so we know in terms of facility and preparations
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.080]   wise.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.680]   So there is a link on the app for you to click and just go directly to sign up for that.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.600]   We're also going to be making the link available on our Facebook site and other means as well.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.880]   Lastly, communion service is going to be on Sunday.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.640]   So please make sure, again, we are asking that people take time to prepare their heart,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.240]   to think about the Lord's sacrifice, examine your heart, and again, really being in prayer
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.680]   too, anticipating our Lord's return.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.040]   So please take time, come prepared as we participate in the communion table together on Sunday.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   Okay.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:36.160]   This morning, we are continuing our special series through the topic of church covenant
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.960]   and the membership commitments that you make.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.800]   And we've communicated that these are things that we hope every church practices, these
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.040]   are things that we hope every single member practices and commits to.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   And I would like to give just a quick review of the various commitments that we've already
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.320]   covered, communicating again that these are things where it builds on each other, they're
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.960]   all interlinked, and these are what we believe to be from Scripture, God's expectation of
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.440]   you in the life of the church.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.040]   The very first thing as foundational to us was the commitment that I confess Jesus Christ
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.800]   as my Lord and Savior, that your relationship with Christ is the foundation, it is the resource,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   it is the context by which you do everything in church.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   Number two, Pastor Peter Chung covered for us that I confess that the Bible is the inerrant
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.380]   word of God, which has ultimate authority over my life.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.840]   What God has said stands the test of time, and it is His word that we submit to and practice.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.800]   And so, you know, he said, "You know, a bare minimum, let's commit to coming together and
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   studying."
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Right?
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.600]   Bible study, that's the bare minimum.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   Number three, Pastor Nathan covered for us that I commit to a life of devotion, to prayer
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.880]   regularly, interceding for the leadership and the members of BCC, that a natural reaction
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.320]   to knowing God, to seeing His sovereignty, to seeing His love, every aspect of seeing
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.560]   God, you're going to respond with prayer, that you're going to engage your God.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   Right?
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   So, with that said, today, we're going to do a skip and jump to number seven on the
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.960]   sheet of our membership covenant, but it flows.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.120]   It, again, all interlinks together.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.160]   And the commitment is, "I commit to building up and strengthening the body of Christ at
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   BCC by developing and using my spiritual gifts."
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.560]   Okay?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   And this commitment, again, interlinks with the others and has its foundation in the realities
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.320]   of our relationship with God.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.400]   And it is a vastly important one to understand what generally in a broad perspective God
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.960]   is desiring for you to do.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.400]   And so, as I say that, I want to introduce this commitment with a little bit of a personal
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.600]   testimony too.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   Not necessarily of my salvation, but after salvation, I wrestled through some of the
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.880]   core, I guess you could say, top-level questions that a lot of people wrestle through, which
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   are the questions of, "What is my purpose?
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   What are my gifts?
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   Where do I fit?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.160]   What am I supposed to do?"
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.840]   And then at the end of that, if you're wrestling with those questions, and let's say you hit
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.560]   some major hurdles in life where what you thought you were going to do didn't happen,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.960]   maybe you weren't as valuable to some people as you thought you were, now all of a sudden
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.400]   you start thinking, "What am I even worth?"
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Okay?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.440]   Now, I had these kind of questions in my life at various seasons, and of course, they're
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.400]   difficult, and it's our God-given responsibility to wrestle through these things.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.560]   Now on a spiritual level, all those questions have an answer in Christ, right?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.000]   Our purpose is found in knowing and living and walking with Christ.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Amen.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.160]   That's true.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.620]   In terms of our value, our value is not found in myself.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.040]   Our value is found in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   That's also true.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.880]   And it requires an incredible amount of faith, trust, and submission to accept that, right?
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.680]   We are by nature so prone to establish, secure ourselves, and it requires an incredible amount
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   of just personal surrender to say, "Lord, I will find myself in you."
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.960]   And to the question of value, to the question of worth, I'm not going to find it in the
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.000]   world, but I'll find it in you, and that's our relationship with the Lord.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I had that moment.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.200]   I remember when I was young, recently saved, and then I was all confused, and then I wrestled
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.280]   with what am I going to do because I got saved right at the end of high school thinking about
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.320]   college, where I'm supposed to go.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.040]   Got those little letters that reject you, you know, "We don't want you at our school."
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.840]   "I don't want you either," you know.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   Going through those, that kind of like certain walls.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.400]   They're small walls, but at the time when you're young, they seem huge and insurmountable.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.720]   But I wrestled.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.880]   And I remember having moments when I said, "God, I surrender.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.640]   I surrender everything."
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.280]   And I remember praying like, "Lord, all those certain things I want, I surrender all that
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   to you.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.720]   I'll even be a pastor."
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.880]   I said that when I was young.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.280]   That's all I knew at the time, you know, that if you're going to really surrender, you say,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.440]   "I will be even a missionary or a pastor," right?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.680]   That's all I knew at the time when I said it.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.280]   But the thing is, just being honest to you, I meant it.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.920]   But what's weird is, although I meant it, I felt weird that I didn't feel clear as to
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.120]   exactly what I was supposed to do.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.720]   Now someone might say, "Well, you're on Collegian, so at the time, you're not supposed to know
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   what you're supposed to do."
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.760]   Maybe, ideally, you should, and for some people, you do.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   Great.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.320]   But a lot of us, we don't.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   You're just trying to establish yourself on what you want to do.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.840]   So then I started asking myself, "Well, what do I want to do?"
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.640]   Okay, confession time from me to you.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.600]   My heart actually is very ambitious.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.440]   I tell people I'm competitive, I'm ambitious, and they're like, "Really?"
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.240]   I just hide it well, okay?
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.120]   If I were to confess, I want to do everything.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.640]   When I was in high school, I had dreams of being a real estate mogul.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440]   I actually got a real estate license when I was super young.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840]   I did property management.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.240]   I got involved with commercial property, and I was like, "I'm going to own this block,"
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240]   right?
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.760]   I wanted to own everything.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.100]   And then I realized, "Oh my gosh, that's so greedy."
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.080]   And then so I was thinking, "Oh, serving people, I want to be a chef.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.880]   I really enjoy cooking.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   I want to be a chef."
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   So I looked into like San Francisco Culinary Arts School and realized like, "That's expensive."
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.760]   I wanted to be a mechanic because I love cars.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.080]   I wanted to do so many different things.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   Why do I share this?
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.640]   Because I want to prep for you this dilemma, the problem.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.400]   The problem is these major questions are very confusing.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.160]   What am I supposed to do even when I'm surrendered to Christ?
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.120]   Where's the direction that I'm looking for?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.680]   And it doesn't help because my flesh takes that opportunity about what should I do, and
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.960]   it jumps in there and it's like, "I want to do this, and I want to do that."
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.800]   So although my heart was surrendered and I wanted to do ministry or at least serve the
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.020]   Lord in some capacity, my flesh also said, "Well, I want to do all this other stuff."
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.320]   And now I was very confused.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.040]   Now fast forward, I started to trek along just learning scripture, and I was so convinced.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.960]   I said, "The Word of God is the living and active Word of God.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.720]   And I want to be a part of giving people this precious treasure, the sweet honeycombs, the
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.960]   light, the direction, and the guide to our feet.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   I want to give this."
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.040]   So I told everybody, "I think I really want to be a pastor."
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:44.520]   I signed up for seminary, and my first year in, I wrestled like crazy.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.960]   I got in there, and then I went, "Oh my goodness, what did I sign up for?"
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.240]   Legitimately, and again, I'm just trying to be open with you, I sat there a couple of
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.480]   days, just staring off into space, but knowing myself right now, I'm a young man at age 24.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.680]   I took a break after college and then went in, and I was like, "I myself, I don't think
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.520]   I'm qualified for this.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.840]   What in the world am I doing here?
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   What if in reality, I don't have the character to even qualify for this position?"
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.560]   I was so discouraged.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.880]   And then seminary, you get late nights, you're in the library, just looking off into space,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.000]   and the motivation to keep studying almost died.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.440]   And then my flesh jumped in.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.920]   The next day you go to class, you look around, it's like, "That guy's here?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.920]   I'm great."
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.760]   Every church would want me, all of a sudden my pride just took the best of me, and all
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.160]   of a sudden I was like, "I think I'm fine."
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.820]   And that's just stupidity and pride, and comparison with other people.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.720]   And then later on as I was graduating seminary, I saw certain other men in seminary where
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.520]   I looked across the room, and these older gentlemen, like 50 years old, they had just
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.880]   brothers who have gone before.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.640]   They just had like four or five kids, they were in class with me, again, I'm half their
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   age literally.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:14.080]   And I was looking at them not like, "Oh," you know, I was just like so inspired because
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.280]   it wasn't so much that, "Oh, they're older and they're here," it was because the way
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.720]   that they received the teaching from the professor, they were like bright-eyed, they were like
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.560]   taking notes, and sometimes they were moved to tears in class.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.720]   And I'm sitting there thinking, "This is pretty dry stuff, I'm not sure why you're crying."
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.000]   But the reason why is because when I talked to them, they've got 20 years of ministry
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.040]   under their belt, but they're like, "The weight of the church is so great.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.280]   I don't feel adequate to lead them.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.560]   I need this for them."
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:49.200]   That's when I was just broken and I realized, "Who am I to think I'm going to get out of
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.160]   here and then I'm going to lead the church?"
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.000]   I felt super discouraged.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.120]   I hope I am sharing with you appropriately the kind of confusion that I had coming out
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.880]   of seminary, wondering, "What do I do?"
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.080]   And I don't know if you are also struggling with that, "What do I do?"
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   And let me ask you a question to pose it to you.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.320]   If you were counseling me and young little Mark came up to you and was like, "Well, I
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.040]   wanted to do this, I wanted to do that, I wanted to do this, I wanted to serve the Lord,
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   be a pastor, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.120]   What would you say to me?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.080]   Maybe you would say, "I know what you should do.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   First thing you should do is calm down, man.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   You want to do way too much.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   You're going to do a million things and not do it really well."
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   And sometimes you know these questions are big questions that don't get answered in a
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   day.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.920]   They're not easy questions where it's like if I flip a switch, "I get it.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   That's what I need to do."
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.480]   Silly me, I just didn't know, right?
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.320]   Many of these questions don't come in terms of the answer in that kind of easy fashion.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.360]   We know that.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   God is going to lead you through these things.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.100]   Okay, now, here's the reason why I set up for you that problem and dilemma of what do
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:06.960]   I do is because through just going to Scripture and then learning what is God doing in this
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.200]   generation, it brought for me such clarity.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.800]   And more specifically, what is God doing in the church?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.680]   Because yes, I can intuitively understand the church is very important to the life of
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   the Christian.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.080]   But what is the Lord doing in the church answered for me so many of those questions, not exhaustively,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.860]   of course, not in a way that perhaps I was thinking, and definitely I still have the
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.840]   responsibility and you have the responsibility to keep asking the question of the Lord, "What
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.120]   would you have me do?"
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.000]   But I realized that question gets indirectly answered when you look to Him and you ask,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.680]   "Lord, what are you doing?
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.080]   Do I see it?
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.920]   God, what have you been doing?
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   What are you doing now?
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.600]   How are you working?
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.640]   What are you engaged in?"
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.760]   And so, with that said, that's how I want to introduce to you the commitment that we
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.560]   are to commit to building up and strengthening the body of Christ at BCC by developing using
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.880]   our spiritual gifts.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.400]   Now, let's read 1 Peter 2, verses 4-9.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.440]   Please turn down your Bibles.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.200]   For the first segment of this sermon, we're going to be here in 1 Peter 2, verses 4-9.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.760]   And I'm going to read it to us.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.480]   It says this, "And coming to Him as a living stone, which has been rejected by men, but
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.160]   is choice and precious in the sight of God.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.840]   You also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.280]   For this is contained in Scripture, 'Behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious cornerstone,
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.080]   and he who believes in Him will not be disappointed.'
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.880]   This precious value then is for you who believe, but for those who disbelieve, the stone which
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.560]   the builders rejected, this became the very cornerstone and a stone of stumbling and a
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   rock of offense.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.040]   For they stumble because they are disobedient to the Word, and to this doom they were also
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   appointed.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:15.600]   But you, you are a chosen race, a real priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.240]   so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   into His marvelous light."
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.400]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:32.880]   God, as we hear your Word pertaining to the building up of your church, I pray, God, that
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.360]   you would grant to us a perspective that is not natural to us, but Lord, is of a revelation
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.920]   that you have given about your plans.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.960]   And what's more, we recognize, God, that your plans, Lord, far exceed anything that human
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   ingenuity can design and anything that we ourselves can build with our hands.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.500]   And we recognize, Father God, that we have the unique privilege to be a part of this
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:05.120]   mighty work, the mystery of, Lord, so many people being brought together and being made
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.240]   one in the name of Christ.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:13.120]   And so we pray that today we would both receive an appreciation for your work, but also, God,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.760]   we would develop a conviction and a commitment to build your church.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.920]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   So as we think about and tackle this idea of, "I commit to building the church and strengthening
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.560]   the body," clearly, one of the things that we have to discuss is the motivation to do
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   so.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.000]   Because I think, honestly speaking, when I look at our congregation, I'm so encouraged.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.080]   Many of you are here already with the sentiment, "I want to serve.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.400]   I want to participate and engage."
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   What we want to do now is to really rehearse and to focus our attention on the rationale,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.640]   the impetus, and the motivation.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:16:00.520]   And what I'd like to say is, as I look at the passage of 1 Peter 2, it is teaching us
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.320]   that building the church is directly derived from who you are.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.160]   So the rationale and motivation comes from who you are.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.600]   Let's take a second look at that passage in 1 Peter, and we're going to draw those observations.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.280]   I've underlined them for you, but take a look at verse 5.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.720]   Take a look at verse 5.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:28.560]   It says, "As," so you also, "as living stones are being built up as a spiritual house for
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:42.560]   There is so much being said there, but what's absolutely clear is that you are living stones.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.840]   Jesus Christ being the primary first one that is set, that sets the pattern, that sets the
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.480]   line, that sets the foundation for everything else that is being built.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.320]   But you, in essence, you are a living stone.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.640]   What's more, what's being built then is a spiritual house, a spiritual house of holy
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.080]   In the next slide, I have for you various other things that you are.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.760]   Take a look at verse 9.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.520]   You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people of God's own precious
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.520]   possession.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.120]   I want you to think about that, just delineate.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:30.080]   The perspective here is that you, in essence, are living stone, spiritual house, royal priesthood,
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.640]   holy nation, a people.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.000]   Now, immediately then, that application then has its meaning for a lot of things we are
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   not to be.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.320]   What am I talking about?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:47.840]   Well, for one, we are not general inspectors when we come to church, but rather we are,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.440]   brothers and sisters, in construction of which you are a piece of it.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.760]   You are not an outsider who is a general inspector coming into the church and saying, "Well,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.820]   let me see how your programs are.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.580]   Do you have a children's ministry?
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.360]   Do you have this and that?"
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.560]   Now, are you allowed to do that?
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   Yes.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   Why?
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560]   Because your children are important.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   Why?
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   Because discipleship is important.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.080]   But if someone comes into the church and says, "You don't have a missions program?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.320]   You don't have a missions pastor?
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   I don't know.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320]   I'll see you later."
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.540]   That, to me, communicates a very weird and interesting perspective.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.440]   You are a living stone that's going to be a part of this build.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.240]   Why do you come in like a general inspector checking off like, "Do you have this?
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   Do you have that?"
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.000]   Again, I don't want to make it so extreme.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   You are allowed.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.400]   What's more, it's wise for you to look at those things.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.800]   But I'm asking you to think about a perspective.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.240]   If ever we thought, "You know what?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   I'm just going to come and go and come and go as you please," do you see these pillars
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.800]   moving going back and going back?
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   Why am I saying this?
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.940]   Because I want you to actually have the metaphorical perspective.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.760]   You are like this pillar.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.240]   You are the living stone that's building this spiritual house.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.920]   You should see yourself like, "You know what?
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.520]   There's a gaping hole in this ministry."
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.800]   But you're the pillar.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.640]   You're the two by four.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   Maybe you think you're like me.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.160]   It's like, "I'm a short two by four.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.880]   I don't fit."
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.960]   But nevertheless, you are the piece.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.800]   You're the piece that's supposed to go and support that part rather than thinking that
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   you're some consultant.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.560]   "I'm going to come in here.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   I'm the expert builder.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   You do this, this, and this, and this, and it's going to stand.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   I'll see you later."
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.720]   That is not our role.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.880]   As a matter of fact, don't you think that could be very arrogant in the eyes of God?
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.200]   The master architect of the church who is the one who's designed every piece, who's
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:50.600]   designed its foundation, its furnishing, its purpose and use, and he's designed all of
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   it.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   People now in this generation, I've seen articles like, "Let's redo church.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.560]   I don't like this whole sermon thing.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.280]   Why do I have to do it this way?
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.800]   Let's make church fit those people.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.200]   Let's make church fit those individuals," or whatever it may be.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.280]   And you think about that, and it's like, "Yes, that might sound well-intending, but when
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.680]   you consider the architect, don't you think that's arrogant?"
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.040]   That's true.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.760]   We are not the architects of this church.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.260]   God is.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.260]   So who are we?
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.440]   We're the living stones that are a part of the build.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   And when you think about your involvement in the church, you have to think in that fashion.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.600]   I do not have the prerogative of the architect to come in here and just dilly-dally, and
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.800]   I want to do this, I want to do that, but if you're asking me to do other stuff, I'm
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   just not going to do it.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:46.720]   But rather to have this fully invested, involved mentality, because I am a piece of the construction,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.280]   here I am.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.760]   Let me help build this church.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   That's the right attitude.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   Amen?
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.240]   Now, what's more then, I'm not going to spend extended time on this because this is for
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.560]   a future commitment of attending and being present, but I want you to think about that.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.840]   If we are a spiritual house, then building doesn't mean like, "Oh, you know what?
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.360]   I helped make sure that everyone is here on time.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.800]   I'm the guy and the enforcer who makes sure people don't have their coffees, and everyone's
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.200]   here," and then you skip out on worship service.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   No.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.520]   You come ready to worship, eager to give God praise, and in your own personal heart
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.840]   attitude of like, "I'm so excited to be here.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.480]   I love singing to God.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.120]   I love hearing you sing to God because praise, glory to Him," that attitude in and of itself
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.600]   builds the church.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   Why?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.800]   Because what God desired is the unified voice of His congregation coming together and singing
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.760]   praise to His glory.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   Right?
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.000]   You showing up, you're building.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.960]   You're the piece, the living stone here.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   Amen?
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   Okay.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.520]   So, that's the first part.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.000]   The other part I want to now talk about is that I have this cross-reference for you in
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.800]   Ephesians chapter 4, that not only are you supposed to show up, again, we're going to
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.320]   talk about that more in the future, but you're supposed to be as a living stone engaged in
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.280]   the service of the church.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.560]   Yes, that's right.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.760]   We in this generation, I believe, not, again, I'm not trying to accuse you or something
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.120]   like that, but there is this common feel within this generation where the mentality is we're
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.540]   going to first build this church and we're going to establish an awesome service and
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.080]   experience for you.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.600]   You're going to come experience it, and that's how the church grows.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.560]   That's not how the church is actually described in this passage.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.640]   Here in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 11 through 16, this is what it says, "And he gave some
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.880]   as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers."
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.240]   So God, in his wisdom, established certain functions and roles within the church, but
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.200]   then look what he says, "For the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.000]   building up of the body of Christ."
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.840]   Question, who is doing the building and work?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.440]   The church, the saints.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.480]   All the individuals of the church are to join in.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.000]   The saints are to do the work of service and the building up of the body until we all attain
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.280]   to the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.120]   of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.440]   As a result, we're no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.360]   about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming."
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:43.920]   Meaning, this build is going to be spiritual in maturity, growing in the likeness of Christ,
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.160]   growing in the strength that the Lord provides.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.200]   And what he says is, verse 15, "That you all, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.120]   up in all aspects into him who is head, even Christ, from whom the whole body being fitted
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.600]   and held together by whatever joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:10.360]   part causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:16.120]   Brothers and sisters, this is not something new to you, but we are rehearsing this.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:22.760]   God has this masterful plan that every single one of you be an integral part, that we are
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   contributing to the growth of the church, and it is not, it is not for professional
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   craftsmen.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.880]   It is not for the guy who has 35 years of experience planting and building churches.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.120]   It is for every single saint in this room.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.120]   Amen?
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.160]   Now, we all might not have the same capacity.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.840]   We all might not have the same set of skills, but nevertheless, the responsibility of the
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.140]   building up of the church is squarely on ourselves, the church.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.720]   And that's why when I thought about it, when I was sad, I gained clarity.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   I loved it.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.840]   I asked our elders for help, thinking through all that stuff.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.440]   They're so gracious.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.600]   But as I started to realize, "Oh my goodness, our church has a vision to worship God, to
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.680]   proclaim His truth, build His community, and evangelize the lost," I was like, "Hey, men,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.180]   sign me up."
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:21.480]   And then realizing that me signing that covenant as a member, I am fulfilling the purposes
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   of God.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.120]   This is the way He has designed it.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.080]   I don't sign the covenant as a pastor, you guys.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.440]   I sign that covenant as a member because the building up of the church is currently God's
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.400]   program.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.160]   The community of faith, you might think it's just a human institution.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.560]   It is not.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.680]   God has said the mystery by which so many different people here and now are joined together,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   it points to the power of Jesus because it's only in His name by which we're gathered.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.160]   And when therefore this church is built, it will point the finger, not at one man, not
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.840]   at one individual, not at a program, it's going to point the finger at the power of
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.360]   God.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.400]   And therefore, the church must be built.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.760]   Letter B, moving forward, the next rationale as to why we must commit to building up the
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.160]   church and strengthening the body is because of what God gave you.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.960]   First was because of who you are, and now what I'd like to talk about is what God has
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.240]   given you in relation to spiritual gifts.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.440]   For this, we're going to take a long journey from in the book of 1 Corinthians 12 and go
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.520]   all the way through chapter 14.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.440]   So please turn your Bible there.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.000]   The rationale and motive to continue to build and strengthen the church comes from what
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.880]   God has given you, specifically concerning spiritual gifts.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.280]   So we're going to walk through 1 Corinthians 12, and I just want to highlight that the
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:56.640]   church of Corinth, very interesting church, it is a church kind of like a lot of people
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.780]   describe it as a problematic church because they do have a lot of problems.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.400]   It straight up begins with like, "I thank God for you, but man, why are you so divided?
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   How come so many of you guys are jockeying for position, so arrogantly putting yourselves
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   above others?
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.880]   You literally try to fight for the front seats, you fight for the first foods.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   Oh my goodness, can you please go home?"
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.440]   Like, that's what some of the tone of the book is.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.320]   But interestingly, in the midst of all that, Apostle Paul commends them because this is
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.720]   a church that was fervently trying to use their spiritual gifts.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   Problem.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:33.040]   In the fervent try to use their spiritual gifts, there was disorder in the church, right?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.440]   There's all kinds of chaos, and a little bit of that flesh also introduced itself in the
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.800]   practice of gifts.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.680]   So first, we take a look at a section in chapter 12, verses 1 through 3.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   Let me read it for us.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.320]   It says this, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   were led.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.120]   Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, 'Jesus
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:07.880]   is a curse,' and no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit."
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.600]   Notice how he contrasts two thoughts.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.680]   Prior to, unaware, lost, confused.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.320]   And I'm sitting there saying, "That's me," right?
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.040]   And then you just follow wherever it may go.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.360]   What is the gift to the church?
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   The gift to the church is that you have the light of truth, and your spiritual gifts that
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.800]   you have in the church is in accordance with the truth.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.640]   That is a unique privilege.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.360]   Some brother said recently, I was talking to him, he said, "Man, you know what's really
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:42.320]   interesting is in such a relativistic generation and world, we see people are actually hungering
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.880]   for something that is objectively true."
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.520]   Yes?
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.320]   The church is given that privilege, to have the spirit of truth in us.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.080]   So I'm talking about the commitment to build.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   Think about this.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.200]   I'm using this as a means to say the spiritual gifts that we have abides with us with the
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.840]   Holy Spirit, abides with us in truth.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.360]   Moving forward to the next portion.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:14.280]   In verses 4 through 11, he says, "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.680]   and there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.920]   There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons."
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   Take a moment there to pause and realize not only has God given spiritual gifts and the
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:35.000]   Holy Spirit as a common good for the church, He has given a variety of them.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.080]   What we're supposed to appreciate here is both the harmony and the union that we have,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.840]   but also the variety.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.360]   Are there different functions?
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   Yes.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   Are there different ministries?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   Yes.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   Are there different effects?
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.220]   And the answer is yes.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.560]   Moving forward, verse 7, he says, "But to each one is given the manifestation of the
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.000]   Spirit for the common good.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.140]   For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to other the word of knowledge
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.880]   according to the same Spirit.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.480]   To another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.180]   And to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.720]   To another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.400]   another the interpretation of tongues.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:24.200]   But one and the same Spirit works all things, distributing to each one individually just
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.680]   as He wills."
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.400]   I would like to summarize that by saying that God has given you, meaning us, the collective
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:39.680]   one body, a variety of spiritual gifts, and that is actually good.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   He is saying this was the will of God to vary the gifts in the church.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.840]   So then let's talk for a little moment.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:54.280]   Okay, that seems fine by me, but if you actually look at church history, if you even look at
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.720]   common church practice in our day, there is a weird phenomenon.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:04.400]   There is this weird instinctual desire in some people to conform everybody to one singular
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.720]   line.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.040]   I have been a part of certain services.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:13.280]   I got saved at a Methodist church down in San Diego, and it was great, and I got saved
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.960]   there, but they practiced a lot of these things.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.680]   It was like, "Everybody get together.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.720]   Today we're all going to learn how to speak tongues."
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.320]   Now at the time, I didn't know any better, but now that I look at certain things, it's
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.680]   kind of like, "Hmm, but not everybody has the exact same gifts.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.840]   Why are we so trying to bring everybody into one mold?
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   What if the brother can't?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.920]   What if a sister can't?"
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.040]   That could potentially be confusing.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.920]   Now I want you to think about it another way.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   Sometimes when I go to school in Kentucky, some of the brothers talk about their churches,
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.920]   and over there, a lot of churches have choirs.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.760]   And some of you guys who have grown up in the church, maybe you guys have heard of the
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.360]   horror stories of choirs and how much problems they cause.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.720]   And sure enough, I talk to some of these friends, and they're like, "Oh man, the choir director
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.360]   and the pastor, they're at odds, and they fight over budget," and stuff like that.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.640]   Now let's imagine for some odd reason, I'm like, "I'm going to start a choir."
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.600]   And let's imagine, just imagine with me that I was inspired, I was singing, and I was like,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.040]   "We need to have a choir."
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.840]   And then I did one of those things, you know, I do the announcements, I'm like, "Everybody
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   sign up."
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.600]   And in order to get you to sign up, I did the whole shebang.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.680]   I rhymed, I was like, "Join the choir, we are in, you know, dire, whatever it needs,"
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.680]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   And I like did a song and dance up here, and then I impressed you all, right?
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.400]   And then at the end of the day, I was like, "Yeah, let's look at the sign up," and only
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   six people signed up.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.040]   And I look, and I'm like, "Oh my goodness, it's the rest of the leaders.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.760]   They didn't want me to feel bad, so they signed up," right?
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:53.600]   Now imagine if all of a sudden I came angry, "Why aren't you guys signing up?
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.800]   What you don't want to sing?
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.480]   Scripture says sing to the Lord."
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   I could pound the pulpit and be like, "We need to have this choir."
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.800]   And then I start getting at you like, "Wait, you, why aren't you part of this choir?"
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   Right?
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.600]   Now part of it is, again, what I'm saying is there is this weird phenomenon where sometimes
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.660]   we expect what I'm convicted by, you must do, right?
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.680]   And sometimes I even hear this.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.840]   I went to a missions rally.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   Missionary came up.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.120]   He's a godly man, but in his enthusiasm, he's like, "All of you are missionaries, and you
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   better go.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   You know why?
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   Scripture says go.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   You're all missionaries.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.120]   Go."
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.800]   And I'm sitting there like, "That's encouraging, but at the same time, I'm not sure if that's
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.840]   the right way to do it because some of the people aren't ready to go.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.520]   Some of the people have desires and convictions to reach out to different types of people.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.600]   Some of these people, I need them to stay.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.160]   I don't want them to go."
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.820]   Now I'm sharing with you this stuff because why?
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.900]   Scripture is making an emphatic point.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.320]   As I walk through this passage, you're going to notice Apostle Paul is making a repetitive,
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.160]   emphatic point.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.300]   God has varied the gifts, and this is to your good.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:14.820]   And therefore, if you look at Romans, the next cross-reference, Romans 12, verse 4-8,
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.280]   this is what he says, "For just as we have many members in one body, and all the members
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.420]   do not have the same function," he says it right there, "they don't have the same function.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.380]   So we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.820]   Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.620]   exercise them accordingly.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.860]   If prophecy according to the proportion of his faith, if service in his serving, he who
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.620]   teaches in his teaching," and it goes forth on and on about the various gifts.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.420]   But I want you to not miss the point because I am, yes, giving this emphatic point, not
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.020]   just simply, "Hey, let's appreciate the fact that you're all different.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.760]   I love you and I thank God for every single one of you.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   I mean it.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.700]   I'm not just saying that, I mean it."
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.740]   But that's actually not the point.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.100]   I hope you're catching what I'm saying.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.460]   Yes, on thank you cards, I write to our church people, "Thank you so much.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.820]   Really appreciate you.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.780]   God has made you each individually different and I love you."
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.180]   That much is true.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:24.380]   But the point is, because he's made you different, you need to exercise.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.740]   Let me repeat that.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:32.260]   Because he's given the church variety, you need to exercise.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.260]   I said, because of what God has given the church, we must commit to build.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.140]   No individual can sit there and say, "You know what?
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.900]   There's plenty of people doing what I do."
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   No.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.300]   You as an individual, if it's Alex, if it's Connie, you as an individual, you are the
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.180]   individual God is using in your unique place.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.340]   Yes, everybody can speak.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.740]   Yes, there's a lot of people who can sing.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:03.460]   But God has made you to be the workmanship, the carrier of his grace, and how you speak
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.540]   into other people's lives, and how you manifest the light that God has given you, that's God's
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.460]   design for you.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.580]   And think about it this way.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.260]   Some of you guys are Lakers fans, super excited this year.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.300]   "Oh my gosh, we've got this amazing center, small forward.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.380]   We have the best small forward ever.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.660]   We've got a decent point guard.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.140]   We have shooting guards.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.900]   We have coaching."
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.780]   Now, think about all this, okay?
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:36.940]   People spend millions to build the team with perfect pieces, the variety of this.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:41.100]   But then all of a sudden, to your dismay, the center who's like seven foot tall, 300
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.380]   pounds is like, "No, I want to shoot threes like Steph."
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.500]   And you're like, "What are you doing?
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.500]   You belong in the center."
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.300]   It's like, "No, I shoot threes."
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.460]   Do you know how frustrating that is?
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.060]   And imagine if the whole team said that, it's like, "Nope, not setting a rule.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.860]   I'm the guy who's going to shoot the three."
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.580]   So the coach gets upset, it's like, "No, you guys are varied.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.580]   You need to exercise your role."
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.140]   It's like, "Nope, I'm sitting on the bench unless you let me shoot threes."
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:12.180]   Now that part of it, I get convicted because I'm not so much rebuking you, I began the
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:20.660]   sermon by saying, "Oh man, one fleshly way that I responded to my confusion in asking
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.940]   the question, 'What should I do?' was to put my foot down and say, 'Well, I'm going to
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.940]   preach.'"
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:30.000]   But imagine, number one, to the church.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.100]   Some guy walks in here and is like, "I've been a consultant, man.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.420]   I know how this thing works.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.900]   Let me in and I'll show you how everything runs and we're probably going to sit here
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.740]   and be like, 'Nah.'"
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   But then think again, always the consideration of the master architect.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.420]   One of the things I was so convinced, convicted by, just like pierced me deep is like, "Yes,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.940]   you may be learned, you may have a seminary degree, but if you demand in the household
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:05.060]   of God to be this one singular role you've set your heart to, now you're useless because
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.260]   what if he wants to use you somewhere else?"
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.420]   And I went, "Oh my God.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.180]   Okay, there are multiple arenas where I need to surrender.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.340]   Not only whole scale God, I started with God, I want to do whatever you want me to do, but
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:27.100]   one of the things I recognize again in clarity is, man, God desires us to build the church
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.140]   and we need to continue to seek that end."
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.500]   Now again, it is our responsibility to keep asking the question, "What would the Lord
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.580]   have me do?
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.540]   How has he uniquely gifted me?
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.180]   Where are the needs around me?"
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.060]   And all those questions, it's not always instantaneous, but you need to keep doing that.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.940]   However, the passage is pretty clear.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:49.180]   We need to be a part of this build because God has varied everything and we have it in
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.180]   the church.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:55.780]   And so, the next portion of the passage, chapter 12, verse 12 through 26 says this, "For even
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.340]   as the body is one and yet has many members and all the members of the body, though there
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.540]   are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:07.700]   For by one spirit, we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.180]   slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of the one spirit.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.700]   For the body is not one member, but many."
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.900]   Remember how I said he repeats this idea?
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:22.980]   Here he goes again, "Appreciate the individuality that God has designed into this collective
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.420]   body."
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.700]   We should do that.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.340]   And then what's more, verse 15, "If the foot should say, 'Because I'm not a hand, I'm not
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.660]   part of the body,' it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.620]   And if the ear says, 'Because I'm not an eye, I am not a part of the body,' it is not for
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.860]   this reason any less a part of the body."
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.900]   And we should hear that and hear the exhortation.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.380]   Another way that my flesh comes out sometimes is the boohoo flesh.
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.380]   You know what that is?
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.540]   It's like, "Woe is me.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.300]   I can't do anything."
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.580]   So he says, "Oh my goodness.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.220]   I'm not an eye, boohoo.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   I can't be a part of this body."
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.780]   Brothers and sisters, no pity parties for us.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.380]   If we are ever said in our minds, "No one needs me.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.180]   No one even cares," that is actually false.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.140]   Is God no one to you?
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.660]   Oh, we shouldn't think that way.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:22.900]   God has designed it so that there are members of the body where with our human eyes, they
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.020]   seem pretty unpresentable.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.140]   They have very little to offer maybe.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:32.540]   But Scripture says we are all a part of a body, indispensable, and therefore we cannot
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.940]   have the boohoo mentality.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.020]   Continuing on, verse 17, he says, "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.020]   be?
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.980]   If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.020]   But now God has placed the members."
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.100]   Oh, pause there for a moment.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.220]   Who has placed the members?
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   God has.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.340]   Who is building the church?
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.340]   The Lord is.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.860]   "Each one of them in the body just as He desired.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.420]   If they were all one member, where would the body be?
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.620]   But now there are many members but one body and the eye cannot say to the hand," in this
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.100]   arrogant tone, "I have no need of you."
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.420]   Or again, to head to the feet, "I have no need of you.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.260]   On the contrary, it is much sure that the members of the body which seem to be weaker
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.740]   are necessary.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:19.580]   And those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.580]   honor.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.740]   And our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas our more presentable
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.020]   members have no need of it."
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:34.960]   Brothers and sisters, we can never have the prideful, "I can do solos" mentality.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.420]   The fact of the matter is we are absolutely interdependent on one another.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.740]   That is how God has designed it.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:48.620]   There are times, again, I hope I'm not like overly giving attention to my weakness or
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.740]   even my overcoming weaknesses, but I have to share, you know, in personal testimony.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:42:00.260]   There are times when I get super self-conscious and I start comparing myself in every fashion.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.020]   I'm not a visionary like our senior pastors.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.060]   I don't have the memory and intellect.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.780]   I don't have the wit of a previously pastor Aaron was here.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.420]   I always thought like, "Wow, he's so witty and so sharp.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   I want to be funny."
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   Like, I would say that.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.900]   And I'm like, "Oh, gosh, what am I doing?"
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.860]   You know?
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.020]   Because regularly I wish, like I study but I can't retain it, so I sometimes am envious.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.940]   Like, "Oh, I want to be like Pastor Peter Chang."
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.220]   I feel like Pastor Nate has a work ethic like just far beyond me.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.820]   I'm like, "Oh, gosh," you know?
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.420]   And our elders are so steady and calm and patient.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.100]   I mean, we could always do that all day long, right?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.700]   But this passage is speaking very clearly to us.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:46.900]   God has so designed us so that we are not one man who has every single character trait
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.500]   and therefore can stand and literally sit there and be like, "I don't need you."
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.140]   You just can't do that.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.540]   And that's good by the design of God.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.540]   Why?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.060]   Because as we collectively do that, again, we're going to give glory to the Lord.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.860]   And so, the next portion of the passage in verse 24 says, "But God has so composed the
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.140]   body giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, so that," and here it is, "the
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:15.340]   purpose of God, so that there may be no division in the body, but that members have the same
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.700]   care for one another.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.620]   And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.980]   If one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.780]   This right here is it.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.980]   To me, this was such a motivation.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.540]   Prior to building the church, that there be no division in the body.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.500]   When I think about the church, what am I caring for?
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.420]   Am I caring for the people?
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.340]   That people are actually growing, that I will carry their burdens with them, that there
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.540]   be no conflict in the church, that what burdens me is almost like a parent's heart.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:51.340]   God forbid that my children would be at each other's throat, but what gives me joy is when
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.060]   my children love each other.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.620]   That is the kind of mentality we should have.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:03.580]   Now I want to quickly move to this next portion.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.340]   The commitment that we talked about said, "I commit to building and strengthening the
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.920]   body," but it also adds, "by developing and using my spiritual gifts."
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.380]   And this passage, the reason why I'm going through such large swaths of it is because
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.140]   it speaks to that element of our commitment, the spiritual gifts.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   So I'd like to turn your eyes to verse 27 through 31.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.460]   It's right up there on the screen for you.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:36.500]   And what I'm saying is, in terms of spiritual gifts, the scripture is actually emphatic.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.100]   You should be seeking spiritual gifts.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.020]   Let me repeat that.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.620]   The scripture is emphatic.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.060]   You should be seeking to grow in your spiritual gifts.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.340]   This is what he says.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:53.180]   Verse 27, "Now you are Christ's body and individually members of it."
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.140]   And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers,
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.380]   the miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.740]   And look at this interesting list of rhetorical questions.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.260]   All are not apostles, are they?
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.700]   And the answer is no.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.460]   All are not prophets, are they?
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.140]   All are not teachers, are they?
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.620]   All are not workers of miracles, are they?
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.260]   All do not have gifts of healing, do they?
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.260]   All do not speak tongues, do they?
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.820]   All do not interpret, do they?
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.300]   And all of those are answered with the answer no.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:33.940]   And then he says this, "But earnestly desire the greater gifts.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:38.260]   I will show you still more excellent way."
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:44.460]   The way I hear that is, to the man who feels like, "I have no skills."
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.820]   And he asks this question like, "Do you have the gift of teaching?"
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.500]   It's like, "No, I don't."
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.260]   "Do you have the gift of this?"
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.220]   It's like, "No."
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.060]   And then you're sitting there wanting, "I wish I did."
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.900]   What's really interesting, he says, "But seek this greater gift."
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.620]   And what I'd like to highlight to you is you know what chapter is next.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:12.820]   It's 1 Corinthians 13, which is famously known as the wedding chapter of love.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:18.100]   But in context, before we read it, I want to remind you that this chapter is in the
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:23.500]   context of chapter 12 and 14, which is talking about spiritual gifts in the church that you
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.580]   should use for the common good.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:33.740]   So as a matter of fact, 1 Corinthians 13 isn't even about your marriage.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.140]   People have used it like, "How do you light a fire in marriage so that you're strong in
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.620]   your love relationship?"
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.980]   It's not about your romance.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.580]   It's not about lovey-doveys.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.900]   As a matter of fact, in context, it is about the gift you should exercise and give to the
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.460]   church for its building, for its strengthening.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:57.120]   This kind of love is the love that you should have for the church.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.740]   And this is where, again, for me, I was challenged.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.340]   There is such a priority for me to love the body of Christ.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.340]   So let's read.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.860]   1 Corinthians 13.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.940]   If I speak with the tongue of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.380]   gong or a clanging cymbal.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.780]   If I have the gift of prophecy, I know all mysteries and all knowledge.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:27.740]   If I have all faith as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:33.140]   If I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.060]   do not have love, it profits me nothing.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.540]   Love is patient, love is kind.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.300]   It is not jealous, love does not brag, and it is not arrogant.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.740]   Brothers and sisters, I want to share with you something.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.740]   Our church leaders, yes, we have people sign off on a membership covenant that says, "I
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.640]   will serve."
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.900]   And we want you to serve, and so when you become a member, we give you this sheet.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:02.660]   It's a new members packet, and it has all like 32 different teams that you can join.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.140]   But we definitely don't want you to have this mentality where it's like, "Sure, I'll do
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.140]   it.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.140]   I get it.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   It's part of your membership.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.140]   Sure, everybody has to pitch in.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.140]   It's kind of like tax.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   We'll do it."
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.820]   Please don't misunderstand us.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.880]   That is not our heart.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.140]   We don't even want you to do it because, "Well, you said so, so I'll just do it.
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.140]   I'm compliant."
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.060]   Like, that's not even the mentality we want you to have.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.420]   You understand what we are saying, that the building up and strengthening of the church,
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.520]   we want it to be an overflow of your love.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.340]   We want it to be a part of your vision.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.540]   This is what God is doing in our generation.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.060]   That's what we want you to feel.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.220]   And so no, we don't have 15 ways that you can just check this off.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.860]   We don't have five top priorities of where you have to serve.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.860]   And yes, although it might feel like some people said, "Oh, every time I ask, how can
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   I serve?"
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.600]   And then the first thing comes up, it's like cleaning ministry, right?
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.400]   But we don't want you to misunderstand this.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.120]   We want you to have this heart of Apostle Paul.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.920]   He is thinking love for the people of Christ.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.700]   And that's what we want you to have.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:11.980]   So that you don't become, the back part of that is, if you do that, where you just do
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:17.060]   stuff without love for the church, what do you become according to this passage?
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.740]   The annoying person who just, "Bang, bang, bang," right?
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.740]   The guy who profits nobody.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.700]   You're just like busy, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.500]   And then you realize you look up, you haven't helped a soul.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.200]   We don't want you to be that.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   Amen?
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.000]   Now, for the sake of time, we're going to move forward to chapter 14, verse 1 through
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   4.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.460]   The passage is very emphatic.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.380]   Should we be seeking spiritual gifts?
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.780]   And you understand what I'm saying is yes, you should be seeking spiritual gifts.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.180]   And for those of you who have already recognized, like, "Wow, I have the gift of administration.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.900]   Wow, I can talk to people.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.700]   Wow, I could ask questions and people feel comfortable around me."
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   Great.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:58.440]   But every single one of us should grow in the avenue of love.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.300]   And yes, the passage is very clear.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.820]   Pursue love, yet desire earnestly this spiritual gift, but especially that you may prophesy.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.620]   It's chapter 14, verse 1 through 4.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.900]   For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.340]   For no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:22.180]   But one who's prophesied speaks to men for edification and exhortation and consolation.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:30.560]   One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but one who prophesies edifies the church.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.800]   So what I'd like to say is you see the dual action.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.640]   Remember in Ephesians, Apostle Paul said, "Speaking the truth in love we are to build."
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.540]   And this passage likewise reiterates the same truth.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.200]   It tells you seek to grow in your gift of loving.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:52.660]   And he says, "Seek to grow in communicating actual truth that people can understand."
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:57.260]   For the benefit of the hearer, for their sanctification and their edification.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.420]   And within this there is a, again, piercing conviction.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:07.680]   Verse 4 says, "The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but one who prophesies edifies
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.860]   the church."
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:13.300]   I want to start wrapping things up by going through with you chapter 14 because he is
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.780]   going to communicate.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:21.140]   Use one case example about tongues to talk about your heart attitude that will edify
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.140]   everyone.
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.220]   I'm going to start reading.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:28.380]   And what I'd like to do is highlight for you every time Apostle Paul mentions this concept
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.980]   of who are you edifying.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.260]   I'm going to start again in verse 1.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:38.140]   "Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.460]   For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.220]   For no one understands.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:48.000]   And in his spirit he speaks mysteries, but one who prophesies speaks to men for edification
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.300]   and exhortation and consolation.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:55.260]   One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but one who prophesies edifies the church.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:00.780]   Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy, and
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.980]   greater is one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.700]   so that the church may," what?
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   "Receive edifying.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.300]   But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I prophet you, unless
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:20.700]   I speak to you either by way of revelation or of knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:26.140]   Yet even lifeless things, either fruit or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:30.700]   produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.940]   on the harp?
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.860]   For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:42.900]   So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.900]   what is spoken?
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.560]   For you will be speaking into the air.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.500]   There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and no kind is without
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.500]   meaning.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:57.540]   If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian,
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.580]   and the one who speaks will be a barbarian to me."
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.900]   Verse 12, listen to this.
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:08.580]   "So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.860]   of the church."
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.540]   Underline, highlight, and star that one.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:20.940]   Whatever you are doing, seek the building up and the strengthening of the church body.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:28.500]   Have you moved beyond, moved beyond the childish ways of what does this church have for me?
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.860]   Have you moved beyond the childish thinking of I don't feel comfortable?
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.060]   Have you moved beyond, well, no one's reaching out to me yet, to rather have the initiative
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.180]   I am zealous to build, to build this church?
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:44.540]   Verse 13, "Therefore, let no one who speaks in a tongue pray."
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.860]   Sorry, I just read that the wrong way.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:51.740]   "Therefore, let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.860]   For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   What is the outcome then?
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.980]   I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the mind also.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.740]   I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the mind also.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.060]   Otherwise, if you're blessed in the spirit only, how will the one who fills the place
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:13.620]   of ungifted men say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.860]   are saying?"
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.300]   You see that?
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:20.740]   How are they going to participate with you in the thanksgiving, in the worship?
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:26.060]   And the answer is, if you're more concerned about your role, if you're more concerned
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.220]   about your use of gifts, they won't.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   For you are giving thanks well enough, but the person is not what?
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.220]   Edified.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.060]   I thank God I speak in tongues more than you all.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:41.940]   However, in the church, I desire to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.700]   others also, rather than 10,000 words in a tongue.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.920]   I hope you are seeing what I'm saying here.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.860]   When I thought about myself, before I used to think, "Oh, there's a balance of really
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.980]   seeking my role and position versus making sure to prioritize."
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:04.580]   But actually, Apostle Paul says, "No, there is a clear order."
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.740]   There is a clear order.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.140]   I would like to put it another way.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:17.140]   This modern thought that you have to reach self-actualization is completely overrated.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:21.340]   The kind of thought you were taught in grade school, and yes, our parents being well-intending,
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:24.300]   constantly saying, "You have to be self-fulfilled.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.540]   You have to reach your grand potential," overrated.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.540]   It's not wrong.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.540]   It's not sinful.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.460]   It's not the worthless, crazy things of the world.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.220]   It could be good.
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:40.620]   But there is such a higher priority that Apostle Paul is thinking.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:47.100]   He is looking at the body of Christ saying, "The edification of the church comes first."
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:52.420]   And when I heard that, when I was thinking through this, again, for me, I was so humbled.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:57.820]   I don't need to be what I always thought I would be.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:03.780]   If I'm used by the Lord for the edification of the church, I say, "Amen."
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.180]   Let me wrap this up by reading the last section.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:13.340]   He says in verse 20 to 26 of chapter 14, "Brethren, do not be children in your thinking.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.260]   Yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:20.820]   In the law it is written, 'By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.660]   speak to this people, and even so they will not listen to me,' says the Lord.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:30.660]   So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.340]   But prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers, but to those who believe.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:39.860]   Therefore, if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and ungifted men
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:44.160]   or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:49.780]   But if all prophesy, an unbeliever or an ungifted man enters, he is convicted by all, he is
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.740]   called to account by all.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:57.820]   The secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so he will fall on his face and worship God,
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.700]   declaring that God is certainly among you.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.100]   What is the outcome then, brethren?
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:09.180]   When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue,
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.820]   has an interpretation.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:14.360]   Let all things be done for edification.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:20.720]   Brothers and sisters, I do want to remind us, we are not just different, but worlds
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.460]   apart from any other community.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:32.160]   You may belong to a ping pong club, you may belong to a bike club, you may belong to some
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.800]   kind of political club.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   That kind of community has a sense of community based on function, based on practice.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:47.600]   We have in God a certain identity where our essence is united by the Spirit of God.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:53.280]   And when scripture says that by that power and by that identity, you are to continue
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.240]   to build what God is currently doing.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:02.880]   And what I want to say is, every single individual has a part in it.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.720]   No matter what we see with our human eyes, every single one of you, and this is not the
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.880]   kind of mantra and cliche speaking of some politician.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.680]   These are the very words of God.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   God has by his own design composed the body that though we are one, we are very, all contributing
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.960]   to the building up of the body.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   Amen?
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.760]   Let's pray.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   Lord, we take time to recognize that what you are doing has, it reaches far, far back
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.080]   into history.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:44.320]   And we realize God, the means by which we accomplish what you are doing, Lord, the depths
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.160]   of which we will not even understand fully in this time.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:56.400]   The sacrifice of your Son, the working power of your Spirit to unite us to your Son.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.880]   Lord, it's crazy to think.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:04.120]   And then to think now, Lord, that the privilege of all of this, the spiritual truth you have
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:11.160]   expressed in your church, which you have designed to be the revelation of the magnifical wisdom
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   of God.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:18.880]   I ask, Father, Lord, that you grant to us both understanding and appreciation, but most
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.480]   more the heart of excitement and commitment, Lord, that we want to be a part of building
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.120]   your church and this all to your glory.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.800]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.200]   Amen.
