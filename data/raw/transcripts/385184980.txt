[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   All right, why don't we pray and then we'll get the teaching portion of our study time
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   started.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:22.280]   Lord, we are so thankful that in your precious word, you've provided so much insight that
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:31.760]   even a child can understand it, and yet just the mysteries are often so profound that we
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.520]   can study this over and over and over again and constantly be learning new things about
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400]   you and your character.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.200]   Would you help us tonight as we just launch our Ephesian study, that you would really
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   cause us to want more, help us to be hungry and excited students of the word?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.640]   We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840]   Well, we're going to be doing this for about a year.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.120]   So some people have complained that Philippians, we went so fast and that it was hard to do
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.680]   like inductive questions for like 14 verses at a time.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.000]   So the people have spoken, the leaders have listened.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.640]   So we are going to slow it down, especially since Ephesians is so rich in theology.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.040]   What I'm going to do is rather than just, because we've done this for Colossians, we've
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.920]   done this for Philippians to like go through each section.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   And for the most part, I believe you guys are probably now proficient in those skills.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.280]   But what I do want to do is just walk through just the first two verses.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.160]   And in these two verses, there's going to be a lot that you will see that will help
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   us to understand the book.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.720]   So I want to start with the first verse.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.600]   It says, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the saints who are at
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   Ephesus who are faithful in Christ Jesus."
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'm sorry if the lettering is small.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.240]   I mean, it's on the Facebook page.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.100]   You can download that.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.500]   So who is the author?
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.040]   And it's important to start with his pre-Christian days.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.880]   So Saul is likely born between the years of 5 BC and 5 AD.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.400]   So he is pretty much at the same age-ish of Jesus.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.620]   He's a Roman citizen by birth from a devout Jewish family.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.440]   And he's a Pharisee.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.280]   And you guys have learned this from the book of Philippians.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.440]   And he is possibly even a descendant of the Herodian family.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.200]   So in Romans 16, 11, you actually see him say, "Greet Herodias, my kinsman."
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   So it's difficult to really prove that, but perhaps that helped him to get his citizenship
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   and make his family prominent.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.820]   We don't know.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.580]   He was trained under a great Pharisee named Gamaliel.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.480]   He persecuted the church and was responsible for the death of many saints.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.440]   Who was the most famous of the saints that he was responsible for the death of?
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Stephen.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.180]   And so he was a very young man with a lot of power, right?
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.520]   What is wrong with the...
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   Is this the...
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Is it the court?
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   It's the Apple computer.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   Okay.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.080]   So there's clearly some prejudice.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.140]   For the record, he doesn't have a smartphone.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.320]   For those of you who are watching at home, I'm talking about Yong Lee.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.800]   And then Paul, interesting, compared to the other apostles, he's directly appointed by
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.960]   Jesus as an apostle.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.620]   So these are things that you guys are familiar with, but they're important to remember because
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.860]   this is a man who wrote one of the most theologically rich books in all of the scriptures.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.300]   Apostle of Christ Jesus.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.860]   So he gets converted around 32 to 35.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.060]   And for the first...
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.940]   If you look at the dates, you don't really know what happened the first 12, 13 years.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:30.140]   But in 46 to 47, he's actually spearheading this Judean famine, helping the poor effort.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.020]   One thing you'll know about Paul, if you study through his letters, he's obsessed with three
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.020]   things.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.760]   One, preaching the...
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.020]   Just preaching the gospel and building up the church.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.060]   Two, making Christ known in unreached places.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060]   Okay.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.060]   Romans 15, 13.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.560]   That's my ambition to make the gospel known to where Jesus hasn't been preached.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.500]   And third, helping the poor.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Okay.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   Galatians 2.10.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.620]   He goes, "I was obsessed with helping the poor."
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.620]   Okay.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.420]   So he's very much an apostle to the Jews.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.100]   And then you have his three missionary journeys over the course of 10 years.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.940]   All right.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.600]   Then he gets arrested.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.660]   And from prison, he writes Ephesians.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.140]   And you guys know what the prison epistles are?
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.500]   Philippians, Colossians, Ephesians.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.980]   So we've just been in his prison time, right?
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.120]   Over the last year and a half of our church.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.940]   But he writes Ephesians around 60, 61.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.500]   So if you look at this, he's been ministering for 30 years, but half the time it was to
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.940]   the Jews.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.860]   Most people know Apostle Paul as an apostle to the Gentiles, missionary to the Gentiles.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.740]   But most of his ministry time actually was to the Jews.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.760]   So he was a minister to the Jews for about 15 years, and then a missionary to the Gentiles
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.700]   for about 10.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.380]   Okay.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   Why was he, all the other 12 original apostles, their ministry was mostly to the Jewish people.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.380]   But Paul is uniquely appointed to the ministry, missionary work to the Gentiles.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.420]   Because one, what kind of talents and skills did he have?
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.360]   He had Roman citizenship.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.100]   He was trained not only in all the best Jewish training, but also he was trained under like
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.820]   Stoic philosophers.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.500]   So he had like Gentile training.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.680]   And he probably was very multilingual.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.420]   And so I share this to say, the first sphere of ministry that God's going to call you to
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.420]   is to your own people.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.580]   But he's usually going to use you in a way that he's been equipping you from the beginning
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.780]   of your life.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.940]   All right.
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:52.580]   So one way to really discern a mission's call, who are those in your harvest field?
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.500]   Think of all that God has given you already, and that'll be a kind of a sign.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   Okay.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.020]   So just on a side note, I think it's very funny when you have, when we were doing ministry
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   in China, like some of these Chinese underground church students were like, "I'm going to go
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.020]   to Zimbabwe and Uganda."
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.060]   And I was like, "Why?"
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.540]   Because they're like thinking we have to go to the ends of the earth.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.160]   But God's not going to call you there.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.120]   First of all, that country is not going to take you.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.700]   You don't have a high school diploma.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.380]   You don't speak English even.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.660]   How are you going to go there?
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:32.320]   So the farther away you go, the harder it is to minister.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.260]   And the ministry that you're going to be doing is going to just start from your Judea and
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.540]   then go to your Samaria and then Lord willing to the ends of the earth.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.980]   And one apostle doesn't do all of it.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.660]   So just to, I mean, the reason I share this is Paul's, most of his ministry was to his
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.660]   own people.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.060]   And then he was a minister to the Gentiles for 10.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.820]   He actually spends two stints in Ephesus.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.000]   First is in a second missionary journey.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.060]   And then the third one, he actually spends three years in Ephesus between 55 to 57.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.380]   So he's familiar with the Ephesian church.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.260]   And that's actually a very interesting question or an interesting thing that we're going to
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.620]   be talking about in a little bit.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.380]   So Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, by the will of God is actually
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.620]   a very important theme in the book of Ephesians because you're going to be hit again and again
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.620]   and again and again.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.580]   God's will is perfect.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.980]   Okay.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.660]   God's will is absolute and perfect.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.460]   And it does not change from the beginning of time.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.260]   So if that were to be the case, if God's will is perfect, what are some of the things that
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.020]   have taken place by God's will and what are some of the things that Paul's prescribing
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.260]   to the churches for all eternity's sake by the will of God?
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.860]   The first one is there is divine sovereignty versus free will.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:06.820]   So we don't fully understand the balance between God giving us free will and him preordaining
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.540]   everything, but that's fact.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.940]   So we're going to wrestle with this.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.240]   Predestination and election before the creation of the world are real things.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.660]   And some people wrestle with that.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.780]   Well, how do I know if I'm, what if I'm not chosen?
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.780]   Right?
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.780]   Well, then I have no chance.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.500]   Well, God doesn't reveal that to you right away.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   Right?
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.820]   So people wrestle with these things.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.940]   But in scripture, predestination is actually, like you can't miss it if you're saying the
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.940]   scriptures.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.940]   Okay.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.220]   There is spiritual warfare and God allows it.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.060]   Wouldn't it be nice if God didn't allow spiritual warfare?
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:49.320]   It'd be awesome if whenever you preach the gospel, there was zero opposition.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   God is God.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   Amen.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   And everyone just goes, hallelujah.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   Right?
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   That would be awesome.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.120]   But he allows spiritual warfare by the will of God.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   Right?
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   So why?
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.760]   Worship in the church, including the diversity in forms.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.480]   Okay?
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.960]   The way our brothers in Tanzania worship is very different from the way you guys worship.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.120]   The way the worship is done in Ecuador is very different than the way people worship
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   in Crail in Haiti.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   Okay?
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.960]   So there's a diversity in forms that Ephesians touches upon.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.040]   Gender roles in marriage.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.640]   Now more and more, the society is pushing against this.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.680]   Okay?
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.280]   And most likely, you have been impacted by this to some degree.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   But there are clear gender roles.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   And I'm not offended by it.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   Right?
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.040]   I mean, I don't use the words to my wife, hey, submit.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.520]   That's very dangerous stuff.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   Right?
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.040]   And she doesn't go, just love.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.760]   Oh, she does just say, just love me.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.640]   But you're careful.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.760]   Right?
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.640]   And so, but gender roles are clearly defined in scripture by the will of God.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   Racial reconciliation is in here.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.920]   Ministry through the church, unity of the church.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   Offices and roles in the church.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.280]   Pastors, elders.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   Okay?
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   Apostles.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.880]   Missions and evangelism is there.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.680]   Role of prayer is here.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.640]   Resurrection of the dead.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.000]   Resurrection from the dead.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.240]   All of this is in here by the will of God.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   Okay?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.720]   And so, a lot of these are hot topics.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   What in the world?
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   Spiritual warfare.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   Right?
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   Stop.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   Okay?
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.040]   So, these are things that you're going to wrestle with today.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.440]   Right?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.040]   These are things that are very pertinent to today's culture.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   So, by the will of God, all of these things have been prescribed.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   All right?
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.760]   Next, the saints.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.480]   We've covered this in Philippians, so I'm not going to spend too much time.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480]   What does it mean to be a saint?
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.560]   If I were to say, oh man, yeah, I love Elise.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.880]   She's such a saint.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.000]   Then you're thinking, oh, she's like a holy moly person.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Right?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.520]   No, but the biblical definition of a saint just means someone who's been called out.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.520]   Okay?
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.520]   Set apart.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.400]   So, if you've done a cursory reading of Ephesians, how does one become a saint?
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.240]   And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.040]   the desires of the mind and of the flesh.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Right?
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.880]   We were by nature children of wrath, but God being rich in mercy saved us.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.320]   And for by grace you have been saved.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   For by grace you have been saved.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.480]   You have it twice in that section in chapter two.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Okay?
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.600]   How are we become saints?
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.640]   How do we become saints?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.880]   Completely by the grace of God.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.360]   Why do we become saints?
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.640]   For we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus for what?
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.760]   To do good works which he prepared before Adam and Eve.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   Okay?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.840]   So, how do we become saints?
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   Completely by the grace of God.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.560]   Why do we become saints?
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.040]   To proclaim the grace of God.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   Okay?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   That's the purpose.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.760]   Now, I want to do a quick little study on saints.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.920]   All right?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.640]   A lot of you have Catholic backgrounds.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   Okay?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.720]   So, hopefully this is a helpful exercise.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.640]   Are saints people to be worshipped or people who worship?
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.360]   So, the Roman Catholic Church, this is who a saint is.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.720]   Someone who's exalted in heaven because of his or her exemplary virtue or merit.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.920]   Saints actually skip purgatory according to the Catholic tradition.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.040]   Canonized saints by the decree of the Pope are venerated.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.920]   They're a model whose life is to be emulated.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.400]   If you're a really good saint, you get celebrated by festivals and holidays.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.520]   And church members are encouraged to appeal to the saints to intercede with God on their
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   behalf.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.720]   But for the Christian, what is a saint?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   It's basically a Christian.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   Right?
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.400]   Paul's favorite term for addressing Christians.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.320]   And we become saints how?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   By calling on the Lord.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   Okay?
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   Raise your hand if you're a saint.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.960]   And you all better raise your hand.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Okay?
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   This is participation time.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.880]   Raise your hand if you're a saint.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.040]   Raise your hand if you're a saint because of your merit.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.920]   Raise your hand if you're a saint because of God's grace.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   Yes, hallelujah.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.240]   All right?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.440]   Anyone who comes to faith in Christ is a saint.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.920]   We are not to be venerated.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.000]   The one who has made us saints alone is to be venerated.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Amen?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Okay?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.720]   And those saints are called to be separated from sin.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.240]   This is an identity.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.680]   This is not a goal to be attained.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.240]   All right?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.400]   So Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God to the saints who are in Ephesus.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.880]   Ephesus is actually a very, very important city.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.480]   It's mentioned in the book of Revelation.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.360]   It's mentioned a whole bunch of times.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.600]   So I'm going to, we're going to talk about the city of Ephesus.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.560]   It's the mother city of Asia.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.420]   Strong influence over politics, commerce, and religion.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.160]   It's the major port city of the West.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.440]   It's very ethnic, multi-ethnic, cosmopolitan.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.400]   It was probably the third or fourth largest city in the Roman Empire.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.880]   So there are a lot of people there.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   Okay?
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.480]   And the Jewish population, percentage wise is not large.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.480]   But when you have 250,000 people, 5 to 10% is a lot of people.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   Okay?
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   So there's a lot of synagogues there.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Okay?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.880]   And there's persecution there.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880]   Okay?
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.260]   Ephesus was famous for its great temple, a shrine to the goddess Diana.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.860]   Anyone know what Diana is?
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.340]   Or who, oh, I put it there.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   Goddess of fertility.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.340]   Okay?
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.460]   Anytime you are a goddess of fertility, you represent wealth.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.860]   Because back in, today, if I had seven kids, some of us are close actually in this room,
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.380]   but if I had seven kids, that would be a burden.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.520]   But for most of human history, if I have seven kids, I have a little army of free labor.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.700]   Okay?
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.200]   So goddess of fertility are very important.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.160]   And one of the seven wonders of the world was this temple of Diana.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   Okay?
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.960]   It's still standing because they made it in marble.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   All right?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   So 425 feet in length, 220 feet in breadth.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.540]   And so this was a religious center of all of Asia.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.120]   This is like the Mecca of the times.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   Okay?
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.840]   So all of the spiritual warfare talk is very important in context of where Ephesus is.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   There's a large stadium there seating 24,000 people.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.320]   Paul actually goes in there in Acts chapter 18 and 19.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   He causes a riot.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   Okay?
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.360]   Can you imagine a riot starting with 20,000?
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.120]   Go to Dodger Stadium and say something silly and everyone's mad at you.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   27,000.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.560]   So he caused a riot there.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   Okay?
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.720]   In Ephesus, there were demon castings, failed demon castings.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.740]   You have all kinds of funny stuff.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.520]   But because people are turning to Christ and they're giving up their idolatry, the economy
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   suffered.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.360]   So Ephesus is actually very important.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.560]   Mentioned 20 times in the New Testament.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   Okay?
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.160]   So just to give you a visual, where is Paul?
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.040]   Can you guys locate where Paul is?
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   He's in the very far, what is that?
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.120]   Upper left-hand corner for you guys.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.100]   He's in a prison in Rome.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.360]   Now with your eyes, locate Philippi.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.120]   You guys see it?
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.800]   You should go straight.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.160]   Epaphroditus visited him in there, right?
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.800]   There's a reason why he almost died.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.360]   It's really far.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   Okay?
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.960]   Tychicus, the pastor, has to go farther than Epaphroditus did.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   Right?
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.400]   So he's going from Rome, carrying these letters all the way to Ephesus.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.160]   He actually has to cross how many bodies of water is that?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   At least two.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   Okay?
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.920]   So it's not close.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.160]   So Paul, taking two years to get somewhere, it makes sense.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   All right?
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.400]   So by airplane, this would not be close.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   Okay?
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.680]   So just think in Rome is where Paul is at, and from there he's writing a letter that's
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   supposed to be circulated to these major cities.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.600]   Okay?
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.480]   This is the Temple of Diana.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   Artistic rendition of it.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.700]   It's huge.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.440]   This is in Turkey now.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.840]   It's still kind of standing.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   All right?
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:22.160]   So when I go, when I'm thinking, I'm going to go to Egypt.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.680]   What do I have to see if I go to Egypt?
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.400]   Pyramids, right?
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.720]   If I'm going to Paris, what do I have to see if this is my only time?
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   Eiffel Tower, Italy, Leaning Tower of Pisa, right?
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.580]   But if I'm going to Great Wall, I mean, that's a really long wall, so you can go anywhere
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.580]   and see that thing.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.440]   But Ephesus, you go there to see this.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.920]   This was a tourist attraction at the times.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.920]   Okay?
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.840]   So there's a lot of religious stuff going on in here.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.000]   Okay?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.640]   So here, this brings us to a problem.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.040]   Okay?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.960]   Was this really written to the church in Ephesus?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.440]   Some of you guys who may have done some commentary work are like, because even if you're a familiar,
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.720]   like if you're just a Bible student, familiar with stuff, Philippians, is there a lot of
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.840]   personal stuff?
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.520]   I urge you, I urge Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord and help you loyal
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.160]   yellow fellow, help these women, right?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.880]   Along with Clement and the rest of my coworkers.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.760]   So there's all of these personal people, Epaphroditus, okay?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.200]   Overseers and deacons in the church.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.160]   But Ephesus is where Paul spent more time than any other city.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.880]   But Ephesians is the most general letter that Paul has ever written.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.160]   Nod your head if you picked up on that.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160]   Give me some feedback, yeah?
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   It's kind of weird.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.760]   He mentions nothing except Tychicus, the pastor who carried these things, right?
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:59.680]   So that's why there's a little bit of a question, did Paul really write this to the Ephesian
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.960]   church?
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.720]   From the second century all the way to about the 19th century, everyone thought this was
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.900]   to the Ephesian church, okay?
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:15.240]   What is going on?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.480]   Ephesian church, can you guys still see?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.360]   Whatever, just pay attention, okay?
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   Look at my face.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.840]   God made it pretty, okay?
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.040]   But the oldest and most reliable records that they found, the manuscripts that they found
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.080]   that are trustworthy, actually don't have the words Ephesus in there.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:45.760]   NIV actually, the, hallelujah, okay?
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.760]   The NIV actually interprets this as to the Ephesian church.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.040]   You guys notice?
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.360]   The God's holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:04.080]   All the other translations are like those who are at Ephesus and everyone else who's
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   faithful.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.760]   So if you guys, I mean, you might not pick up on that if you're just doing one translation.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.160]   And it's interesting, oh my, okay.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.200]   For the video people, they're like, why is he freaking out, right?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.720]   There's a lot of technical difficulty, all right?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.600]   So in 115, he says, I have heard of your faith.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:29.880]   Can you imagine if during my time in China and Korea, I wrote emails to some of you,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.160]   it's like, hey, I've heard of you guys at Berean.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.320]   That would be so weird, right?
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.220]   'Cause I spent most of my ministry at Berean.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:44.840]   So Paul, this is a very strange way to write a letter, okay?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.160]   Frank Fehlman, a very well-known scholar says, this is one of the most difficult textual
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.680]   problems in all the New Testament.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:57.480]   Did Paul write this to the Ephesian church?
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:04.640]   If I had to retitle this book of the Bible, I would actually call it the Epistle to Ephesus
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.560]   and the Churches in Asia Minor, okay?
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:13.200]   It's supposed to be, well, I'll go to that.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:19.360]   So the consensus among all the scholars is this, Paul did write it from prison.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.680]   And Tychicus came holding these things as proof, okay?
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:30.600]   Paul wrote it, but Ephesians was actually a circular letter intended for multiple cities.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.960]   And I've listed a bunch of cities that you can get to within a day and a half of walking,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.040]   okay?
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   So this was meant to be circulated.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.320]   Now if I'm going to spend three years in China, logically, where would I first go?
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   What would you guys think?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.040]   I go Beijing.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.100]   Why is Beijing so important?
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.920]   It's the center, right?
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.080]   So my first destination will be Beijing and then maybe all the other big cities.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:12.480]   So because perhaps this was actually first taken to Ephesus because that's the hub, it
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.920]   was probably very closely associated with the Ephesian church, okay?
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   So R.C.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.120]   Sproul, someone you guys are familiar with, I only put up people you're familiar with.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.200]   So this is what he says.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.600]   It seems likely that Paul, toward the end of his life, had a burden to write to the
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.680]   church in general, a synopsis of the revelation that was given him as the apostle of Jesus
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   Christ, a summary of the great truth of Christianity.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:40.960]   John MacArthur, many scholars think that this letter was an encyclical, intended to be circulated
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.240]   among all the churches in Asia Minor.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.520]   It may be that the letter was sent first to Ephesus and therefore became especially associated
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.380]   with that church, okay?
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.040]   So it's okay that it might not be only to Ephesus, okay?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.280]   But we call it Ephesians because I'd rather call it that than Paul's letter to the Ephesian
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.160]   church and the other churches in Asia Minor, okay?
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.440]   So it's supposed to be...
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.000]   So early texts, actually some of them, had the church name missing.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.460]   So it's like a copied letter with Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, to the saints who
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.040]   are at blank, who are faithful in Christ Jesus.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.560]   Are you guys following this?
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.600]   So Ephesus definitely is on his mind, but this is not the only audience that this letter
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.600]   was intended for, all right?
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.660]   Verse two is 100% exactly the same as Philippians.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.760]   If you guys have memorized Philippians, this should be very familiar, "Grace to you and
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.360]   peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.120]   100%, so I'm not going to talk about grace or peace, okay?
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.400]   Other Ephesian similarities, Colossians and Ephesians are very similar.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:25:00.280]   155 of the Ephesian verses, 75 of Colossians, it's very similar to the book of Ephesians.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:07.640]   Ephesians 6, 21 to 22, Colossians 4, 7 to 8, almost 32 words are like almost word for
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.280]   word, slight variations.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.700]   So Paul probably wrote these at the same time, okay?
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.920]   So he had a lot on his mind, and then he distributed it to their intended churches.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.540]   So the book of Ephesians is extremely important.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.460]   It's some people's favorite books throughout the history of Christendom.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.480]   This is one of the favorite books, okay?
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.520]   So Paul wrote it for a general audience to start with at Ephesus.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.320]   So this is why we study this.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.400]   Clinton Arnold, who was actually one of my favorite profs at seminary, this is what he
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.840]   says, "This letter summarizes what it means to be a Christian better than any other book
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.280]   of the Bible.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.120]   William Barclay, by common consent, the letter to the Ephesians ranks very high in the devotional
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.400]   theological literature of the Christian church.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.160]   When the Scottish Protestant reformer John Knox was very near to death, the book that
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.480]   was most often read to him was John Calvin's sermon on the letter to the Ephesians.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.600]   John MacArthur says, "Ephesians has been given such titles as the believer's bank, the Christian's
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.200]   checkbook, the treasurer of the house of the Bible," because you see like inheritance,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.920]   riches, fullness, fill to fill to fill, you see that a lot, okay?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.520]   This beautiful letter tells Christians of their great riches, inheritance, and fullnesses
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.360]   in Jesus Christ and his church.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.600]   Ephesians focuses on the basic doctrine of the church, what it is, and how believers
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.600]   function within it.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.480]   Why should we study this?
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.440]   So we can do church God's way, not Orange County's way, not America's way, but God's
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   way.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.880]   You guys following along?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.280]   It's not helpful to go like verses three to eight, verses nine to 14.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.360]   That's helpful when you're doing a personal study, but here's one easy way to just remember
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   Ephesians.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.720]   First three chapters, doctrine.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.580]   So there's a lot of heavy stuff in there.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.360]   Last three chapters, application.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.240]   The because, and then you have the therefore.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.440]   So chapters one through three is very theological.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.660]   Chapters four through six is very practical.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.440]   So from here till June, we're going to be very theological.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   We're going to do theology.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.640]   We're going to do a lot of it, like predestination, spiritual gifts.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.200]   We're going to do all this stuff.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.880]   But then toward the end of the year, we're going to be like, then what does that mean
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   for my life?
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.720]   Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful in building
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   others up according to their needs.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.320]   Oh man, I have to apply this.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.040]   Let him who steals, steal no longer.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.760]   Oh man, wives, submit to your husbands.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   Ooh, I got to apply that.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.420]   I mean, half of you do.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.080]   I don't have to.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:49.440]   So chapter four, you have that hinge, therefore, and therefores are very important words because
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.120]   you have to say, what is that therefore, therefore?
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.160]   And then you have the therefore.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   Here's what is to be expected.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.200]   So chapter four starts with, therefore, I, prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.360]   in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.720]   The word in a manner worthy, it's literally suitable, fitting, snug.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.080]   Walk snug of the gospel, as appropriate to.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:22.240]   So he's going to give you three chapters of what God's done.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.440]   And then we're going to look at three chapters practically of what we ought to do because
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.400]   of what God has done.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.440]   So that's the overall view of the Ephesians.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.480]   Couple things to remember.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.840]   Who wrote it?
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   Paul.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:44.000]   Super general letter to generally the churches in Asia Minor, starting with Ephesus.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.240]   Very theological.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   First three chapters, theology.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.840]   Last three chapters, church.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.520]   How do we live this out in the context of our people?
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.960]   So you're going to do some discussion time.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   Here's some questions.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.840]   What are some things that Ephesians says about the will of God that you have a hard time
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.080]   coming to grips with?
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.160]   Because we're going to cover them in the first few months.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:15.220]   I have a hard time trusting if God really is good, then why does this happen?
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.360]   That's actually part of that heart is in all of us.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.040]   So I'm going to grapple with this.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   Some of you husbands are passive.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.080]   I don't know how to lead my wife.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.400]   But as Christ loved the church, but sometimes she's mean.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.800]   You're going to have to wrestle with this.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.320]   What are the things of the will of God that you have a hard time wrestling with?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.520]   Two, in what tangible areas of your life are you praying that the letter to the Ephesians
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.560]   speaks into this year?
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:52.720]   In your marriage, in your spiritual warfare, in your understanding of theology, in your
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.520]   being filled with the spirit rather than being filled with drunkenness.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.280]   What is that for you?
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:04.500]   Because we're going to spend 2020 not only doing evangelism, but we're going to study
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.920]   how God wants church to be done.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.720]   And the third question, Ephesians 6 describes our struggles not being against flesh and
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.520]   blood.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.400]   People are never your enemy.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.240]   Nod your heads if you agree with that.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.880]   If the person sitting next to you, you don't like him, you don't like her, he or she is
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.560]   not the problem.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.840]   There are spiritual forces at work that's causing division and strife.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:41.160]   So in your life, there are probably people that you want to hug very, very tightly to
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.880]   hurt them, right?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.560]   Or punch them in the face.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:53.300]   But our spiritual struggle is against the spiritual world and not people.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.200]   People are never the enemy.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.840]   Donald Trump, he is not anyone's enemy.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:10.800]   Obama, Clinton, the thief on the cross is not people.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:18.160]   What are some of the battles you feel you are currently engaging in that you need prayer
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   over?
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.560]   And that's how I want you guys to kind of share practically.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.840]   And that's it.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.600]   Let me pray for us and then we'll dismiss you to discussion.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:36.680]   Lord, we're embarking on an interesting year.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.600]   And Lord, in the pit of all of our hearts, we want to do church your way.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.640]   So would you teach your people how to properly be your people?
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.520]   And would you help us to live out what we say we believe?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.880]   For your name's sake, in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.240]   Amen.
