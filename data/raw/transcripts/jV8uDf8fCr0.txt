[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.840]   And Lord, when we think about our salvation,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.560]   it wasn't just something that happened
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.520]   in happenstance or vacuum,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.980]   but something that was extremely intentional,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.680]   something that was thought out and planned
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.960]   and filled, Lord God, with a self-sacrificial love.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.080]   And so as we spend some time tonight singing
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.900]   and meditating upon these things,
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.040]   would you give us an understanding,

[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.320]   and that it will cause us, Lord,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.120]   to praise you and to give you the glory that you deserve.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.240]   We ask all these things in the name of your Son, amen.

[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   - Hi, church family.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.860]   My name is Karen Aquindo, and I'm in family ministry.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.860]   My husband is Alex, and I have two daughters,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.860]   Camille, who's three, and Aubrey, who's one.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.860]   I'm a stay-at-home mom, mostly,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.860]   but I work one day as an optometrist.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.860]   I've been attending Berean for 18 years now.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.860]   And this year, it's significant because it's half my life.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.860]   So here is my testimony.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.860]   I was raised in a non-Christian,
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.860]   Japanese-American home in Torrance, California.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.860]   I grew up with many comforts of this world
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.860]   and had a wonderful family life
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.860]   with a stay-at-home mom to be readily present in my life.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.860]   I have fond memories of my childhood
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.860]   and never really questioned much in life.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.860]   But because of God's love and grace,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.860]   he chose me out of all my family members
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.860]   and started putting his presence in my life
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.860]   in both big and small ways.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.860]   One significant period was when my mom decided
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.860]   to drive my sister and I, when I was in middle school,
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.860]   to a Christian church for youth Bible studies
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.860]   on Friday nights to get good moral teaching.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.860]   This is where I first got to learn about God and the gospel.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   We never attended Sunday church as a family,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.860]   so that period ended quickly.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.860]   But that was my first exposure to God,
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.860]   and I learned about the power and value of prayer.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.860]   Fast forward to freshman year at UCI as a bio major,
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.860]   and I wanted to live out the liberal life I saw in the media.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.860]   I attended various drinking parties, went clubbing,
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.860]   and was exposed to many sinful things.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   Despite all this, I happened to meet
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.860]   a culturally Christian guy in my dorm mid-year.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.860]   We had a short period of dating
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   where he reintroduced going to church again.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.860]   However, this was very infrequent,
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.860]   and we attended the church without much attention given to us.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.860]   Our relationship ended at the end of our freshman year,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.860]   and I went into summer heartbroken.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   That summer, I began contemplating
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.860]   a lot of what was the purpose in life.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   I seemed to have it all--good family, good friends,
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.860]   doing great in school, no financial issues.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   I had everything the world said I should have,
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.860]   but why did I feel a sense of emptiness?
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.860]   I now know that God was doing this work in my heart
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.860]   to reveal that emptiness is found
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.860]   when trying to fill up my life with the world,
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   and that there is always brokenness
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.860]   when there is separation from God.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.860]   I remembered the power and value of prayer,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.860]   and I prayed a little during that summer
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.860]   to a God I did not know.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.860]   I returned to UCI my sophomore year,
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.860]   and another friend from my dorm invited me out to CCM.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.860]   This is where I met Pastor Mark,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.860]   who was leading the ministry at the time,
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.860]   and he invited me to Berean Community Church.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.860]   At this time, I believe God prepared me
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   to truly meet Jesus and know him.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.860]   Pastor Mark picked me up that first Sunday
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.860]   and drove me to a small community center in Irvine,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.860]   and I remember hearing and seeing members
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.860]   passionately worshiping God
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.860]   and the Bible being taught with conviction from Pastor Peter.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.860]   This experience made me attracted to keep attending
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.860]   and learn more of who this God is.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.860]   An older sister began meeting with me,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.860]   one-on-one to go over the book of John together
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.860]   to help me learn about Jesus and explain the gospel to me.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860]   She was so gracious to give of her time
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.860]   and answer all my questions as an unbeliever.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.860]   Slowly during that period,
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   through the Holy Spirit, God's Word, and believers,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.860]   God opened my eyes and granted me
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.860]   genuine repentance over my sins
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   and simple faith to believe in the name of Jesus
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   and follow after him as my Lord and Savior.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.860]   I finally found the satisfaction and fullness I was longing for,
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.860]   and it was only found in knowing Jesus.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.860]   I was baptized shortly after,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   and my life miraculously transformed
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.860]   from a wandering soul seeking pleasures of this life
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.860]   to being redeemed by the blood of Christ,
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.860]   being found forgiven of my sins, past, present, and future,
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.860]   and as one now striving to live in obedience.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.860]   This is often the end of most testimonies,
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   but I wanted to share a little bit about my Christian life since.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.860]   It has been a journey.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.860]   That simple faith God first planted 17 years ago
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.860]   has grown only because of God's faithfulness to me.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.860]   When seasons of life got very difficult
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.860]   and the temptations of this world grew strong,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   God did not relent in his work in my life.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.860]   During the times I doubted,
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.860]   God reminded me of his fulfilled promises.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.860]   When I did not get what I wanted in life
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.860]   and was tested through trials,
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.860]   he reminded me he is sovereign.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   When I was surrounded by many blessings,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.860]   he showed me he is the provider of all things,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.860]   and when I did not want to listen,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.860]   he still provided the means for me to hear his voice.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.860]   In Philippians 1:6, it says,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.860]   "I am confident of this very thing,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.860]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.860]   will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.860]   I stand here today only by the grace of God
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.860]   and his good work in my life,
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.860]   reminding me that he is God worthy of worship,
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.860]   that he is a God who is faithful,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.860]   he is gracious, he is good,
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   he reigns as king over his creation,
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   and he sent his only son, Jesus,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.860]   for the sins of all mankind,
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.860]   which is what we remember specifically this week.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.860]   I'm so thankful to know my God today,
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.860]   who rescued me,
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.860]   and I'm so thankful to have become a Christian here at Berean
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.860]   and to still call it my home church.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.860]   Berean has given me biblical teaching
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.860]   from the first day I visited,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.860]   and a church family to grow with,
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.860]   and my faith through the years.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   I'm praying that our community continues to strive
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.860]   in encouraging one another
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   to stay anchored in Christ till the day we see him,
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.860]   so that we can worship him together forever.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.860]   Thank you.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:54.860]   [applause]
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.860]   I want to embarrass Karen a little bit more,
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:03.860]   but if you guys know about our travels to India,
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   Karen was actually the first optometrist to go with us our first year,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.860]   so she was very much a trailblazer of sorts.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.860]   And in India, what she would do is we would set up this kind of like eye tent,
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.860]   and there was like a black curtain over it.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.860]   You needed that in order to examine eyes,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.860]   and it would be super stuffy.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.860]   You couldn't breathe in it,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   and she'd just be in there and just soldiering on,
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.860]   and she's 4'11", you know,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.860]   and we were in this remote part in India,
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.860]   and she's just soldiering on.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.860]   As I was just listening to her testimony,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.860]   you know, someone who had no intention of seeking God,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.860]   and God knows, though, he's going to save her,
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:52.860]   and then years later he's going to place her in some random village in India,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.860]   and she's going to do his work.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   That is glory to God.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:04.860]   You know, this entire week we've been here at church
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.860]   listening to devotions by several leaders,
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.860]   and it's been incredibly encouraging
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   just to see such a big portion of the church here
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.860]   to give worship and glory to our God because he deserves it.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:22.860]   And I was just thinking about this today as I was preparing for tonight's devotion.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.860]   I remember being at this church and not really knowing how to worship God.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.860]   I remember it very well because I was in college.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.860]   I was just left college. I was 22 at the time.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.860]   And just echoing what Karen said, I'm so thankful for this church.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.860]   I'm thankful for Pastor Peter, that God gave him the convictions that he has,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.860]   and that just many years later God is continuing to work,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   and his kingdom will always continue,
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.860]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it as a church invades the world.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.860]   And I hope you guys get to know that in a deeper way.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.860]   So before I continue to ramble, because I can do that,
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.860]   why don't we pray and get to the devotion, okay?
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.860]   Let's do that.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:11.860]   Father, we thank you, Lord, for your word.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:18.860]   We thank you that you have made it clear to us what you desire for us, Lord,
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.860]   that you have provided everything for salvation.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.860]   You are the one who chose us.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.860]   You are the one who regenerated us.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   You are the one who have placed in us this faith.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   And Lord, as we live a life that is grace-fueled, Lord,
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.860]   help us to live a life that is worthy of the calling that we have received.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   And we know, Lord, that there is no area of our life that is untouched, Father.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:56.860]   And so because every area of our life depends on how highly we think of you,
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   especially this week as it is the cornerstone of our faith,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.860]   help us to think deeply, Lord, of the events that transpired,
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.860]   that we might look forward, Lord God, to seeing you again.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.860]   Lord, I pray, Lord, that the words that I say tonight, Lord,
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.860]   that they would come from you, and anything that I say that is not of you,
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.860]   that you would take away.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.860]   So give us this time and pray these things in the name of your Son.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.860]   Amen.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.860]   Okay, so today is Thursday of Passion Week,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.860]   and there are several events that occur on Thursday of Passion Week.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:40.860]   The most significant, arguably, is the institution of communion.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:46.860]   Now, the inauguration of communion, we know, though, had a previous shadow.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.860]   When Jesus institutes communion for the first time,
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   he was building upon Passover.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:31:00.860]   So Passover was this shadow, and Jesus is giving the actual flesh to it.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.860]   He's giving the substance to it.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.860]   So we find the Passover instructions in Exodus 12, verses 1 through 13.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.860]   I'm going to read it for us because it's relevant here.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.860]   Exodus 12, 1 through 13, says this,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   "Now the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.860]   'This month shall be the beginning of months for you.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.860]   It is to be the first month of the year for you.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.860]   Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying,
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.860]   'On the tenth of this month, they are each one to take a lamb for themselves,
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.860]   according to the father's households, a lamb for each household.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.860]   Now if the household is too small for a lamb,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.860]   then he and his neighbor nearest to his house ought to take one
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.860]   according to the number of persons in them.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.860]   In proportion to what each one should eat, you are to divide the lamb.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.860]   Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.860]   You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.860]   You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.860]   Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.860]   and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat."
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.860]   The lintel is the top part. The doorposts are on the sides.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   "They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire,
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.860]   and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water,
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.860]   but rather roast it with fire, both its head and its legs,
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.860]   along with its entrails.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.860]   And you shall not leave any of it over until morning,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:28.860]   but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall completely burn with fire.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.860]   Now you shall eat it in this way, with your garment belted around your waist
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   and your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.860]   And you shall eat it in a hurry. It is the Lord's Passover.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.860]   For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   and fatally strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.860]   from the human firstborn to animals, and against all the gods of Egypt,
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.860]   I will execute judgments. I am the Lord.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.860]   The blood shall be a sign for you in the houses where you live.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.860]   And when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.860]   and no plague will come upon you to destroy you
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   when I strike the land of Egypt."
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   We don't exactly know when the exit has happened,
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:21.860]   but it's about 1,200 to 1,400 years before Christ appears on the scene.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.860]   So that would mean for about 1,200 to 1,400 years,
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860]   the nation of Israel, or at least the faithful ones,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.860]   would practice this God-ordained sacrament,
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   reminding them, teaching them, and even giving hope in times of despair
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.860]   of who God is, what he had done in the past,
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   and that he is in complete control of all things
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.860]   because this is taking place on an international scale.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:55.860]   So when we fast forward to the time of Jesus and his apostles,
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.860]   when he takes the last Passover before his crucifixions,
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   what we see is we see Jesus giving instructions,
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.860]   the disciples implementing those instructions,
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.860]   and then the eventual celebration.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.860]   This is what Matthew 26, 17 to 29 says.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.860]   "Now on the first day of unleavened bread,
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.860]   the disciples came to Jesus and asked,
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?'
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.860]   And he said, 'Go into the city to a certain man,
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   and say to him, 'The teacher says my time is near.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   I am keeping the Passover at your house with my disciples.'
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   The disciples did as Jesus had directed them,
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.860]   and they prepared the Passover.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.860]   and as they were eating, he said, 'Truly I say to you
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   that one of you will betray me.'
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.860]   Being deeply grieved, they began saying to him, each one,
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.860]   'Surely it is not I, Lord.'
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   And he answered, 'He who dipped his hand with me in the bowl
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   is the one who will betray me.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   The Son of Man is going away just as it is written about him.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.'
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   And Judas, who was betraying him, said, 'Surely it is not I, Rabbi.'
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.860]   Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself.'
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.860]   Now while they were eating, Jesus took some bread,
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.860]   and after a blessing, he broke it and gave it to his disciples and said,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.860]   'Take, eat, this is my body.'
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.860]   And when he had taken a cup and given thanks,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   for this is my blood of the covenant,
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.860]   which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:54.860]   from now until that day when I drink it with you new in my Father's kingdom.'"
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   So what Jesus is doing here,
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   he is taking a centuries-old tradition,
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   the centuries-old tradition that for the nation of Israel
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   has been the most significant redemptive event in their history.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   It is the most significant event.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   He's taking that event, and he's saying that's actually a shadow.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   The ten plagues, the passing over,
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   the parting of the Red Sea where you guys were baptized through the Red Sea,
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   that's actually a shadow.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   Consider the absolute arrogance of Jesus if he is lying,
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.860]   but the exorbitant grace of God if he is telling the truth.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   The exorbitant grace because if he's telling the truth,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   in their lifetime, the shadow is finding fulfillment.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.860]   The shadow is finding fulfillment.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   And as great as that event was,
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:13.860]   they are going to see the actual substance of it.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   Of course, for us as God's children,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:23.860]   we are absolutely sure that this is indeed the fulfillment.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   There are other people in the world right now who are celebrating the shadow.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.860]   Many of them do it sincerely.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   But not because of anything we've done.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.860]   We celebrate the substance.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   Christ is our Passover lamb.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.860]   And notice what it says in verse 29 here.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.860]   Notice what it says.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   I refer to the last Passover meal with the disciples
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   because that is what it is before, prior to the resurrection.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.860]   But in verse 29 he says,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   "But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now until that day
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.860]   when I drink it with you new in my Father's kingdom."
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   There's going to be an actual day when Jesus will drink with his apostles new
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.860]   in his Father's kingdom.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   A day that has not been fulfilled yet, even for us,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   but that will find its fulfillment in the future.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   So for us, communion, the substance of Passover,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   commemorates our hope based on an event that took place in the past
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   but sustains us now.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   And it gives us hope for the future.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   At the end of this meal, they probably would have sang Psalm 136 together.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   Psalm 136 has 26 verses, so I'm not going to read it to you,
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.860]   but you could break it up into three general parts.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   The first general part deals with God as king of the universe,
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.860]   as creator and sustainer of the universe.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   And there's an oft-repeated phrase.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   And that oft-repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.860]   The second general part speaks of the Exodus account,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.860]   how God rescued them through various miracles
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   and how God led them out through the Red Sea
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.860]   and gave them land as an inheritance.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   And again, the oft-repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.860]   "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   The third part, the shortest part, is a concluding section
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   that ends with Israel understanding who they are,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   a humble nation rescued from their adversaries and from their adversities.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:52.860]   And the oft-repeated phrase is, "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   "For his loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   It sounds pretty triumphant, right?
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   I mean, "His loving kindness is everlasting."
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.860]   And that's what they would have sang together.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   So if that is the case, why is it that in the next arc of the story,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   they are filled with sorrow?
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.860]   Not godly sorrow that leads to repentance.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   Worldly sorrow.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   That sorrow where you just want to sleep
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   because you want to check out from reality.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.860]   The sorrow that we've all experienced where it's just too much
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.860]   and we just say, "I'm so tired.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.860]   I'm going to go to sleep and pretend that reality isn't real."
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.860]   Well, you read about it in Matthew, right?
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   They were grieved because one of them was going to betray him.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.860]   But in order to feel the punch just a little bit more,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:57.860]   it helps to look at John 13-17, the upper room discourse.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:04.860]   Because in John 13-17, we have what the synoptic gospels kind of leave out.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.860]   So I'm going to do like a bird's eye view,
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.860]   kind of like a jet flyover of John 13-17
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.860]   because I want you to feel that punch.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.860]   In John 13, we see Jesus.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   He takes a towel. He wraps it around himself.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:26.860]   And then he motions to his disciples that he's going to wash their feet.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   And remember, for these disciples, they didn't have the comfy new balance, right?
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.860]   I mean, with the memory foam, their feet were dirty, right?
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.860]   It was extremely dirty.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.860]   So you have this picture here of the king of the universe
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   stooping down to wash the feet of sinners.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   And afterwards, he tells his disciples,
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   "You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   But if a teacher and Lord does this,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   then you ought to do for one another."
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.860]   It would be after this moment that Jesus breaks the news to them
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   that one of them will betray him.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   Judas, upon leaving, afterwards, Jesus predicts his coming glory
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   and tells his disciples that he would be with them for a little longer.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.860]   And just as he had told the Jews earlier that where he is going,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   they could not come.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   And as someone who is getting ready to be dispatched on a mission of certain death,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   he is leaving behind important instructions, instructions for them to know.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   So that command is to love one another.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   But Simon Peter, more interested in where he's going,
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   it's like he almost disregards these instructions and he asks him,
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   "Where are you going?"
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   Jesus responds, saying, "Where I'm going, you cannot follow, but you will later."
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   And you know the response to this, right?
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   "Well, I'll follow you to death."
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.860]   And Jesus says, "Well, before the rooster crows,
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.860]   you are going to deny me three times."
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.860]   And so despite the fact that it will be Jesus,
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:19.860]   he will be the one that will be before this illegal, quasi-judicial kangaroo court.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   He is the one doing the comforting, as opposed to the other way around.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   In John chapter 14, Jesus tells his disciples that although he is leaving,
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   he is leaving to go to prepare a place for them,
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   that he would come back, that he would take them to himself.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   That they need not be concerned about seeing the Father,
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.860]   because if you had seen Jesus, you have seen the Father.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.860]   And that it was to their advantage that he was leaving,
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.860]   because he could send a helper.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   The helper was with them, but then the helper would now be in them.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:06.860]   The great shepherd, the one they had been walking with over the last three years,
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   the one whom they saw walk on water, feed thousands upon thousands,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   control the elements, heal the mute, deaf, and blind,
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.860]   the one who had power over death.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:27.860]   This same Jesus was now going to leave.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Jesus understands that punch.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.860]   So he tells them, "I'm not leaving you as orphans."
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.860]   You guys are thinking I'm leaving you. I'm not leaving you as orphans.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.860]   The Holy Spirit is going to be in you.
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.860]   And to give you a little primer on discernment,
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   the real believers are the ones who follow my word.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.860]   They are the ones who love me.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   And it's almost like he's telling his apostles,
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.860]   in case you ain't taking notes,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.860]   in the event this news is causing you to hyperventilate,
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.860]   in case either you will misremember or not remember at all,
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   the helper is going to come, and he's going to guide you into all truth.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:20.860]   He will bring to remembrance all the things I have said to you.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:26.860]   And so you are going to be crushed, absolutely crushed by my death.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   But he is telling them in advance so that they would believe.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   What's going to happen isn't some random chaotic series of unforeseen events
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.860]   where things got out of control.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.860]   Maybe we should have just pleased Judas.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.860]   What's going to happen is quite the opposite.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   Scripture needs to be fulfilled.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   And the Father is the one sending the sign to the cross.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   In John 15, Jesus will go on exhorting them to abide in him,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.860]   stating again to love one another,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   to remember that when the world hates them,
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.860]   they do so because the world hated Jesus first.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.860]   In John 16, he again reminds them of the Holy Spirit,
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   that the Holy Spirit will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness,
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   and that he had much more to say.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   He had much more to say, but because of their grief, they could not bear it now.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.860]   They would all eventually all scatter and leave.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   And so Jesus encourages them in John 16, verse 33,
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   "These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   In the world you have tribulation, but take courage.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   I have overcome the world."
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   And finally, in John 17, what we know as the high priestly prayer,
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   a prayer that was prayed for the benefit of the disciples,
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.860]   a prayer that the apostles probably overheard.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   He says this in John 17, verses 1 through 5.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   "Jesus spoke these things, and raising his eyes to heaven, he said,
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   'Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.860]   just as you gave him authority over all mankind,
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   so that to all whom you have given him he may give eternal life.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God,
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.860]   and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:36.860]   I glorified you on the earth by accomplishing the work which you have given me to do.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.860]   Now you, Father, glorify me together with yourself,
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.'"
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   So imagine you're the disciples here.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.860]   Imagine you're one of them.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:58.860]   Despite all the reassurances that Jesus is giving to his apostles,
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:03.860]   the promise of the Holy Spirit dwelling in them and no longer with them,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.860]   the promise that they would come along but later,
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.860]   the promise that Jesus would come back, take them to where they were,
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   despite all of that, if it were you and me, we would be pretty discouraged too.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   They had left everything they knew to follow Jesus.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   They left their entire world to follow him.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   They gave up everything.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.860]   And upon following him these past about three years,
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.860]   they had witnessed the feeding of the masses with the child's meager portions,
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   the curing of the nobleman's son, the hauling in of the great amount of fish,
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   the casting out of unclean spirits,
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.860]   the healing the servants of Roman officials, controlling the elements.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:04.860]   They were also almost literally imbued with power at one time to go do the same.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:09.860]   They had felt what it was like to cast out spirits in Jesus' name.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   They had experienced a life, a fullness of life, a robustness of life unlike any other.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.860]   And now it's seemingly crashing.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   And now it is seemingly all coming to an end.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:34.860]   So despite the fact that Jesus told them that it was to their advantage that he would go away,
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   you would understand why they were sorrowful.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:48.860]   But more than just understanding, we are the disciples many times, right?
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:50:03.860]   How many times in our own life have we felt beset, immersed in sorrow, in guilt, in sin?
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:11.860]   Almost nearly always because of the choices that we have made in our own very lives.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   We see the absolute humility and selflessness reflected in the Son of God.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   That the little amount of time that he has,
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.860]   just the little amount of time he has before his betrayal and his crucifixion,
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.860]   he is the one praying for his disciples.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.860]   Because the disciples check out and just go to sleep.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.860]   And what's interesting about John chapter 17, verses 13 to 20,
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   he's praying for his disciples, but also in that moment, he's praying for you and he's praying for me.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.860]   John chapter 17, verses 13 to 20 says this,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:53.860]   "But now I am coming to you and these things I speak in the world,
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:58.860]   so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.860]   I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world,
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.860]   just as I am not of the world.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them away from the evil one.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.860]   Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   Just as you send me into the world, I also send them into the world.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   And for their sakes, I sanctify myself, so that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth."
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:32.860]   Verse 20, "I am not asking on behalf of these alone,
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:38.860]   but also for those who believe in me through their word,
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I in you,
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   that they may also be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me."
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   Oh.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   So the precious amount of time that he has left as he's praying, he's also thinking about us.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   And in that way, you and I are just like the disciples.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:10.860]   And so you see, he had to go.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   He had to be our Passover lamb, because our sin required him to go.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   Satan was the one trying to stop him from going to the cross. We know that.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.860]   Because Jesus' response to Peter is, "Get behind me, Satan,"
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   after he tells him he's going to be killed and raised.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:41.860]   It is the Father sending his Son to the cross.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:49.860]   It is the Son willingly laying down his life in obedience to the Father
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:55.860]   for the joy that is set before him.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.860]   So as Passover was celebrated for hundreds of years,
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   as Christians, we remember and relish in the fulfillment and in the substance,
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.860]   no longer the shadow.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:18.860]   And as New Testament communion is instituted for the first time during that night,
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:23.860]   now, whenever we take communion, we also do it in obedience of our Lord
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:28.860]   and looking forward to God's promises in the future.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.860]   I want to end this with a quote from Charles Spurgeon on this subject.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:37.860]   He preached about this, and he has a quote that I really like on this subject.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:43.860]   And in the quote, he is discussing whether or not anything plus Christ
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.860]   washes away our guilt.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:51.860]   In the quote, he is discussing anything plus Christ washes away our guilt.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:58.860]   Anything such as godless ideologies that we syncretically wed to the gospel
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:04.860]   and alleged good work that we wed to the gospel, right?
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   Church association, legalism, abused grace, CRT, social justice,
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.860]   worship of the state, Christless conservatism,
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   anything that is wed to the gospel.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:25.860]   He says this, "You may be as righteous as you like.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   If you have not the blood sprinkled, all the goodness of your doorposts
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.860]   and lintels will be of no avail whatever."
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:37.860]   "Yes," says another, "I am not trusting exactly there.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.860]   I believe it is my duty to be as good as I can,
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.860]   but then I think Jesus Christ's mercy will make up the rest.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.860]   I try to be as righteous as circumstances allow,
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:54.860]   and I believe that whatever deficiencies there may be, Christ will make them up."
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.860]   That is as if a Jew had said, "Child, bring me the blood."
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.860]   And then when that was brought, he had said, "Bring me some water."
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   And then he had taken it and mixed it together and sprinkled a doorpost with it.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.860]   Why? The angel would have smitten him as well as anyone else.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.860]   For it is blood, blood, blood, blood that saves.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:20.860]   It is not blood mixed with the water of our poor works.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:24.860]   It is blood, blood, blood, blood, and nothing else.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:29.860]   And the only way of salvation is by blood.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:34.860]   For without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.860]   Have precious blood sprinkled upon you, my hearers.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.860]   Trust in precious blood.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   Let your hope be in a salvation sealed with an atonement of precious blood.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.860]   And you are saved.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   But having no blood, or having blood mixed with anything else,
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   thou art damned as thou art live, thou art alive.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   For the angel shall slay thee, however good and righteous thou mayest be.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.860]   Go home then and think of this.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:15.860]   Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.860]   Let's pray.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:33.860]   Lord, as we contemplate the greatness and the deepness of salvation,
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:40.860]   we know that salvation is of the Lord.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:46.860]   There is none of us, no human being that has ever lived, Lord,
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.860]   that has led a good life, at least in your eyes, Father.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.860]   All our righteousness are like rags before you.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.860]   And Lord, you looked upon our depraved state,
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:06.860]   and you had determined, regardless, to send your Son.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.860]   And that pleased you, Father.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.860]   We know that there is only one innocent person
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   that has lived the entirety of their life in sinlessness,
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.860]   and that was Jesus.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:27.860]   And he was forsaken for our sake.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.860]   We consider the sinlessness of the Son of God,
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   that in that hour that he prayed even for us,
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.860]   help us, Lord God, to worship you with a thankfulness and a gratefulness
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:45.860]   that corresponds to the great salvation that we have received.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.860]   It is in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.860]   Let us rise as we sing our closing praise.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:16.860]   Our glory.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:21.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   whose priceless blood has ransomed me.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:34.860]   Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:39.860]   and hung Him on that judgment tree.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:45.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:51.860]   who crushed the power of sin and death.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:59.860]   My only Savior before the holy crowd.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   The Lamb who is my righteousness.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:09.860]   The Lamb who is my righteousness.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   [music]
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.860]   Our glory.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:23.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:29.860]   my life He bought, my love He owns.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:36.860]   I have no longings for another.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   I'm satisfied in Him alone.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:47.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:53.860]   His faithfulness my standing place.
[00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:01.860]   No foes are mighty and rush upon me.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   My feet are firm held by His grace.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.860]   My feet are firm held by His grace.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:19.860]   [music]
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.860]   Our glory.
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:32.860]   who carries me on eagles' wings.
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:39.860]   He crowns my life with loving kindness.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:44.860]   His triumph song I'll ever sing.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:49.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   who waits for me at gates of gold.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:03.860]   And when He calls me, it will be paradise.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:09.860]   His face forever to behold.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.860]   His face forever to behold.
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.860]   Our glory.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.860]   Our glory in my Redeemer,
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   who waits for me at gates of gold.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:33.860]   And when He calls me, it will be paradise.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:39.860]   His face forever to behold.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.860]   His face forever to behold.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.860]   His face forever to behold.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:58.860]   [music]
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.860]   Let's pray.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.860]   Father, as we continue to reflect on the events of this week,
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   help us, Lord, to depart with gratefulness, Lord.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   And Lord, help us to come tomorrow, Lord,
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.860]   prepared to receive Your word
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:19.860]   as we tomorrow reflect upon Good Friday.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.860]   Lord, it is beyond good, Lord.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   Good is an understatement.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.860]   Deeply impress upon us, Your children,
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.860]   the events of tomorrow.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.860]   We pray these things in the name of Your Son. Amen.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   [silence]
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
