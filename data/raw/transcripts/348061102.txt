[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 3 verses 12 through 19.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.320]   Hebrews chapter 3 verses 12 through 19.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640]   Take care brethren that there not be in any one of you an evil unbelieving heart that
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.480]   falls away from the living God.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.520]   But encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today so that none
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.760]   of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420]   For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.040]   firm until the end.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.200]   While it is said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as when they provoked
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   me.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000]   For who provoked him when they had heard?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.820]   Indeed did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.760]   And with whom was he angry for forty years?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.480]   Was it not with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.260]   And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest but to those who were disobedient?
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.080]   So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.360]   Let's pray.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.760]   Gracious Father we thank you for your patience.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.040]   We thank you for your mercy.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.000]   We thank you for the cross.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.240]   We thank you for giving us eternal life.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   We pray Father that your word would speak to us.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   Soften our hearts, open our eyes.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720]   That we would be willing Father God not only to listen but to apply all that you give.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.880]   We pray that what you have intended with these words that in our generation Lord God that
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680]   we would heed it, that we would apply it, and that we would be sanctified.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.800]   And so we entrust this time to you that your name may be exalted in Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   Amen.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.560]   You know in the last few months I've been visiting the doctors quite a bit.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.440]   Again not necessarily because something specifically is wrong but because our church changed insurance
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   from HMO to PPO so I had to find new doctors and every time you visit a doctor they do
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.960]   the exact same thing.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.080]   You know whatever it may be just a routine checkup and they first they weigh you and
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   then they take your blood pressure.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.960]   And then so they go off that information and they ask a few questions and then if the questions
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.040]   come back and there's anything concerning they'll ask you to do blood tests.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.280]   And then if the blood test comes back and then they see some problems from that they'll
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   give diagnosis and ask you to visit other doctors and go see a specialist in certain
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   things.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.240]   And it's almost true of any doctor you go to no matter even if you have a stubbed toe
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.840]   you'll go in they'll weigh you and then they'll take your blood pressure.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.720]   Just to kind of examine that there might be something that points to something and that's
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.240]   usually what I experience when we go to the doctors.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.280]   Well the text that we're looking at the whole book of Hebrews is really the author is like
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.040]   a physician who's carefully examining this church to see where they're going astray.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.680]   We have seen and you'll continue to see there is no specific doctrine that they are rejecting
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.120]   in Christ.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.320]   Their primary problem was their Christian life with the pressure that was coming from
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.640]   the world was starting to get to them and so they were slowly beginning to drift back
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.520]   into their old life.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   Now to them because their old life was Judaism that's what they were struggling with and
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.960]   that's why the author systematically puts the supremacy of Christ in every chapter that
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.400]   he's above the angels above Moses above the high priest above the sacrificial system above
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640]   the sacrifices itself.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.380]   But his what he is doing is carefully examining this church to see what is causing this drift
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.040]   and ultimately to warn them that if they don't catch themselves from this drift that eventually
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.120]   they're going to find they may find that they don't really have faith at all.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.160]   And then it warns in the at the end of it says because of their unbelief that they did
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   not enter the rest.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.560]   Now chapter 3 ends with this warning it started this section in chapter 3 began with this
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.920]   warning and then it ends with this warning with a nation of Israel.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   Verse 16 for who provoked him when they had heard indeed did not all those who came out
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.360]   of Egypt led by Moses in other words they were exposed to all that God had for them.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   They ate miraculous food and then when that wasn't enough God gave them quail God opened
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   up the ground and gave them fountains of water.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.400]   They were the ones who walked through the Red Sea and saw God's power.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.240]   They saw all that God had done but at the end their behavior provoked him.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.760]   Verse 17 and with whom was he angry for 40 years.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.680]   Was it not with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the wilderness.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.480]   Again it was not a one time event.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   This was characteristics of this group for 40 years.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   They were constantly grumbling before God and to whom did he swear that they would not
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   enter their his rest but to those who are disobedient.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.920]   Even though they were Israelites even though they were even though they were God's covenant
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.760]   people that their constant grumbling before God caused them to fall away.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.080]   So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.680]   It is a small small things that we see in our life that if we're not careful that causes
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   us to drift.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.040]   So this text that we're looking at this morning I'm going to divide it into three parts where
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.600]   he encourages us and warns us about this drifting toward apostasy.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.560]   So there's three encouragement one to take care.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   We'll look at that first.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.040]   We're going to spend most of our time on that and then two to encourage one another and
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.780]   then third to persevere.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.360]   So to take care to encourage and to persevere.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.600]   So let's take a look at the first one.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.360]   This warning against apostasy he says take care brethren that there not be any of you
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.560]   evil unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.240]   The word take care literally is blepo which means to look.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   It's the future tense of optonomi.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   So those of you who are optonomist and you know that that's where the word comes from.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.360]   It basically means to take a careful look in the King James version just says to take
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.440]   heed.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.860]   New King James it says to beware and I.B. it says to see to it.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.780]   But basically it means to carefully look.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.780]   I think that Chinese character for be careful kind of captures that idea.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.320]   Those of you guys who know Chinese I know probably half the room probably know some
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.400]   Chinese and the Chinese word for be careful is Xiao Xing.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   In the service I said Xiao Xin and then I got rebuked by a bunch of people.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Xiao Xing.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.240]   And Xiao Xing literally means small heart.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   Small heart.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.480]   So why would be careful like if you go to a bathroom saying be careful they'll say Xiao
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.280]   Xing on it.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.040]   So when I first learned of this word like why would the Chinese word for be careful
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.680]   be small heart.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.240]   Well I googled it.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.880]   And I probably could have just asked anybody at our church but I googled it.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   And basically the idea behind it is the heart meaning to take care.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   To take care small small things take care.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.480]   Does that make sense.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.800]   Pay attention to detail.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.600]   That's basically what it means to be careful.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.200]   That's a literal word for be careful in Chinese.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.440]   Xiao Xing.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.160]   That's exactly the idea behind this word blepo in Greek.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.760]   It means to be careful and to watch out.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   Because often times it is the small things that we kind of sweep under the rug.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.120]   That we don't think it's a big deal.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.360]   You could think about all the things that the Holy Spirit could have used as an example
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.240]   of the rebellion of the nation of Israel.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.600]   There were period in Israel's history where they sacrificed their own children.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.560]   They went after idols.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.680]   They defiled the temple of God.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.080]   I mean you could say if you look at the totality of Israel's history the 40 years out in the
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.440]   desert was probably the highlight of Israel's history.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.560]   That's when they were the most obedient.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.140]   It wasn't until they went into the promised land where the outright idol worship began
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.960]   to just take break out.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.480]   But all throughout scripture it is the time in Israel's history in the 40 years out in
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.320]   the desert is used and highlighted, repeated over and over again as an example and a warning
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.720]   against apostasy.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   But the primary problem with the nation of Israel is a constant discontent with God.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.200]   That if they were thirsty they were hungry and if they were hungry they didn't have meat.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   How far?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   Why did God bring us out here?
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.200]   And we saw that a few weeks ago.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.280]   That it didn't take much from the very beginning, even before they were delivered, there was
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   grumbling that was taking place.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.420]   Even after they came out of the Red Sea and they would break out into worship just a few
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.840]   days later.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.120]   They would break out into grumbling, "Why did he bring us out here?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.440]   Moses goes up into the mountains, he doesn't come down soon enough."
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.520]   And then they break out and they make golden calves and begin to worship it.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.800]   Out of all the things that God could have chosen as an example, as a warning against
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:23.080]   Israel's apostasy, it was what seems innocuous at first look.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.700]   That's chosen as a primary example.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:32.520]   And the reason why is because the root of rebellion started with that.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.600]   The reason why they went after idols and worshipped other gods, it started out with a discontent
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.680]   and unbelief in their heart that was expressed through their grumbling.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.040]   Isn't that exactly what Jesus says in Matthew 5, 27 and 28?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.600]   You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.100]   But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.360]   adultery with her in his heart.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.840]   Now the Bible is not saying that the person who actually committed adultery versus somebody
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.400]   who's struggling with lust is equally sinful.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:13.040]   And what he is saying is that small root of lustful thoughts and lustful look that you
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.560]   compromise and say, "Well, it's not a big deal because I didn't commit the physical
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.920]   act."
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.580]   That is the root of adultery.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.720]   And that's why that is highlighted again in James chapter 4, 1 through 2.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.960]   Watch what he says, "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you is not the
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.720]   source of your pleasures that wage war in your members.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.200]   You lust and you do not have, so you commit," what?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   "Murder."
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.840]   Did you see what he did?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.800]   He went from coveting to murder.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.760]   He said it is this desire that you have that is unmet, that's frustrated, which is causing
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.480]   the quarrels.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.940]   It's waging war within our members.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.840]   And then when you get frustrated enough and it bears enough fruit, not only does it cause
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.560]   conflict, it says the root of murder is this envy.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.200]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.720]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.060]   And the reason why people cannot ask is because they know that the desires of their heart
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.240]   has nothing to do with God.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.680]   That's why they do not ask.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.980]   In fact, if you look at the Ten Commandments, it starts out by saying, "Thou shalt not have
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.480]   no other gods before me."
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.800]   I use the King James Version because it has more authority.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   At least it sounds more authoritative than "Don't do this."
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.040]   That's the way I memorized it when I was young.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.240]   "Thou shalt not have any other gods before me."
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:44.520]   But if you look at the Ten Commandments, why did the Israelites struggle with idolatry?
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   What caused them?
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.160]   After all that God has done for them, after everything that they saw from God, why would
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.880]   they in their right mind, when they got into the land of Canaanites, did they constantly
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.360]   struggle with idolatry?
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.280]   Answer is pretty simple.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.720]   It was a desire, a coveting of their heart.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.160]   When God didn't provide the rain and they got frustrated, when they looked at the Canaanites
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.600]   or the people of the land and they seemed like they were doing fine and they were having
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.080]   many children, they began to worship Asherah.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.520]   They began to worship Baal because they were the gods of fertility.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   So if God is not going to answer, then I'll go this path.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.940]   So the root of idolatry was coveting.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.400]   They saw what other people had and they wanted it, and so if God wasn't going to give it
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.120]   to me, I'm going to worship this idol.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.980]   First Commandment.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.520]   The defilement of the First Commandment is a small root of coveting in their heart that
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.680]   they are allowed to continue to percolate and to grow in their hearts.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.600]   "Thou shalt not make unto thee any other graven image."
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   That Second Commandment basically is worshiping God, but then worshiping Him in the way you
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.920]   want to worship Him.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.480]   Creating a God in your own image and worshiping Him.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.680]   Why do you think that the health and wealth gospel is so popular around the world?
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.580]   They have the same Bible.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:16.400]   They supposedly have the same gospel, and yet they believe that if you believe in Jesus
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.680]   Christ that God's going to make you healthy and wealthy.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.040]   Why is this false gospel so popular around the world?
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.620]   Because of the coveting of their heart.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.300]   They create a Jesus.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.780]   They call Him Jesus.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.000]   They read the same scripture, but it's not the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.560]   At the root of the defilement of the Second Commandment is coveting.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.600]   They want Jesus to give them what they want, and if they don't, they'll create another
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   Jesus.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.520]   "Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain."
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.400]   Every single one of these commandments, the root cause is because of a desire of their
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   heart.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Why do they use the Lord's name in vain?
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.200]   Today, we only think of it as saying, "God something," and using it as a curse.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.400]   But really, the application of verse 3, the prohibition of verse 3 is not using the Lord's
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.720]   name and pursuing things and giving credit and saying that this is for God.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.040]   And the perfect example of that is in the Middle Ages, the Christian Crusades.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.680]   They're angered by what the Muslims did, and they're going to retaliate.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.480]   And so they went there, and they did exactly, you know, like committed some horrendous acts
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.740]   under the banner of Christ.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   And that's what that means.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.280]   So what was the root of that?
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   Anger.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.320]   Coveting.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.240]   Just like James says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," coveting someone else's wife.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.800]   "Thou shalt not steal," coveting what other people have.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.000]   "Thou shalt not bear false witnesses."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   Again, in James chapter 2, "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:56.600]   In the end, all of the Ten Commandments ultimately point to the rebellion of Adam and Eve.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.280]   God gave them everything, created them for the purpose of worshiping God and giving credit
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   to God.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.720]   Instead, they saw God's glory and said, "I want some."
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.400]   That was the root of Adam and Eve's sin.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.160]   And that was the root of Satan's sin.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   It may seem small and insignificant, but you and I live in a generation where coveting
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.440]   is rampant.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.960]   We have phones, and we look at our social media, we are constantly bombarded by other
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.380]   people's best parts of their life.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.600]   You don't put your failures, or you don't put when you had a hard time with something
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.300]   or difficulties in life.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.920]   You highlight the best parts of your life, whatever that may be.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.520]   And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.040]   I'm not saying that responsible Christians put all the bad things and complain.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.600]   But we end up coveting what we see.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.760]   And so we're constantly on our phones, on the tip of our finger, looking at the world.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.540]   We're not even talking about Orange County, looking at the world of things that we could
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.080]   possibly have.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   I want to go there.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   I want to eat this.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   We look at other people having birthday parties and say, "How come I'm not invited to that?"
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.160]   We look at other people moving into their new homes and say, "Oh, how come my house
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.760]   isn't like that?"
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.280]   And we are constantly bombarded and feeding ourselves with coveting in our hearts.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:32.440]   And so we have spiritually saying that we need to look for eternal things, but on a
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.760]   day-to-day basis, we are filling ourselves with the things that have nothing to do with
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   God.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:43.200]   1 Peter 2, 11 says, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.600]   lusts which wage war against the soul."
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   First, let's stop here.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   Aliens and strangers.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.280]   If we don't first and foremost acknowledge and understand and embrace our identity as
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.680]   aliens and strangers in this world, that sometimes will lead us into wanting, like, "I want to
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   belong.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.000]   I don't want to be an alien and stranger in my work.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.320]   I don't want to be an alien and stranger at my school or even in my home."
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.560]   And so, because we want to belong, we begin to covet what they have.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.980]   We want to have what they have.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.480]   We want to do what they do.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.400]   But he says, not realizing that these desires that we are feeding ourselves is waging war
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.920]   against our soul, and oftentimes we're not even aware how it is eroding us.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.320]   We become numb.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.360]   We become numb to the unholy things of this world, not realizing there's a spiritual battle,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.640]   not outside with satanic things, but inwardly with our own desires.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.680]   In Psalm chapter 1, verse 4, it says, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.960]   counsel of the wicked."
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.920]   What is the counsel of the wicked?
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.760]   The counsel of the wicked is constantly feeding us what you should want.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.920]   You should be this kind of person.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.040]   You should have that kind of a job.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.600]   You should have this kind of relationship.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.200]   You should have that kind of community.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.480]   And so we are constantly being fed the ideologies and the principles of this world.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.080]   But he said, "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.520]   stand in the path of sinners."
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.320]   Do you see the progression?
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.760]   An individual who gives in to the constant coveting of what he sees, he or she sees,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.960]   he eventually is going to stand with the sinners.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.280]   He's going to be identified with them.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.200]   So standing with sinners basically means that you're not going to look any different.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.080]   It starts with our thoughts and our desires, then eventually you begin to be identified
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.440]   with them, and then the final conclusion is that you nor stand in the way of sinners,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.720]   nor sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.160]   You become an antagonist.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.040]   And so there's this progression of sin, and it begins with desire.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.060]   And this desire that is unmet, and that was the root of Israel's sin.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.120]   God was not enough.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.280]   Their God was their comfort.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.320]   Their God was their belly.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   So when God didn't provide, they began to grumble.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.880]   They began to complain.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.200]   Because they weren't worshiping God.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.120]   They were hoping that God would worship them.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.480]   John chapter 139 verse 23, "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.720]   Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.000]   See if there's any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.440]   When was the last time you truly prayed this prayer before God?
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.840]   I mean you can pray even now, you can pray it, but when was the last time you really
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.600]   stood before God and searched me?
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.840]   Search my inner parts.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.480]   Search my thoughts.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.240]   Search my emotions.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.560]   Search me.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.360]   See if there's any hurtful way in me.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.280]   Or have I just swept these things under the rug?
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.040]   It just doesn't seem like a big deal.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:20:01.000]   Israel's apostasy, the warning of Israel's apostasy, wasn't their idolatry, wasn't their
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.920]   child sacrifice, wasn't the defaulting of the temple.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.320]   It was just their constant discontent with what God gave them.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.720]   And he says, "Be careful.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Watch out for these things so that you do not fall into evil and unbelieving hearts."
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.880]   He calls us evil.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.280]   The word for evil is "pernea," and where we get the word "pornography."
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.040]   And the word literally means "to be corrupt."
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.960]   And this grumbling that they kept on doing before God, he says it was evil, it was corrupt,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.160]   because God created the lips of man for the praise of his glory.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.240]   And instead of praising him, all that came out of his mouth was complaining how God didn't
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.860]   meet their needs.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.520]   And so therefore, he calls it evil because it was corrupt.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:58.440]   And this corruption ultimately is a revelation of unbelief.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.580]   Unbelief is what caused them to not see what it is that they had in Christ.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:12.880]   The result of what seems to be innocent, if it is not checked, it leads to evil.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.640]   It leads to hardening of heart and eventually unbelief.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.960]   Praising God is not something that you can do because of your strong will.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:30.120]   It says in Hebrews 11, 6, it says, "And without faith, it is impossible to please him."
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.360]   This is not something that you determine to do and say, "You know what?
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   I'm going to do better.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   I'm going to be more moral.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   I'm going to be more disciplined.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   I'm going to give more.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   I'm going to sacrifice more."
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:44.960]   He says, "If you don't have faith, no amount of determination, no amount of will, no amount
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.560]   of sacrifice is going to please him."
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.640]   Because what God desires more than anything else is worship.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.400]   And worship is not something that you choose to do and say, "You know what?
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.280]   I'm just going to change and be a different person."
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.760]   He says, "Without faith, it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.680]   first believe that he is."
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.640]   So if you look at other translations, they may say, "He who comes to God must first believe
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.880]   that he exists."
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.440]   But I think the correct translation is the NASB where he says, "He who comes to God must
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   first believe that he is."
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.280]   And I believe that this is directly related to the "I am" statements that Jesus made in
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.560]   the book of John, where in every circumstance, they were depending on the leadership, they
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   were depending on the gate, they were depending on whoever else, and Jesus continued to say
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.000]   to them, "I am."
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.560]   I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.800]   No one comes to the Father but through me.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   They're living in fear because of death.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.880]   He says, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.120]   Well if you go, what's going to happen to us?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.280]   He says, "I am divine.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.640]   You have to abide in me."
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.920]   And he keeps telling them, "I am the light.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   I am the door.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.840]   I am."
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.760]   And that's exactly what the author of Hebrews has been telling them all the way up to chapter
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.240]   12.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.920]   That everything that you have confidence for, everything that you're putting your hopes
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:15.160]   for, he says, "If you do not first believe that he is, there is no way to please him."
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:22.360]   Our life is a constant revelation of what it is that we value and believe.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.680]   Not our attendance on Sunday, because, you know, this is hard.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.400]   The hard part of doing church in Orange County, California, again, this is not unique to Orange
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:41.960]   County, but I believe that this is happening even in China, or it was, where it's comfortable.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.800]   This is a great place to come if you're lonely.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.640]   There's a lot of friends.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.800]   Maybe you like playing baseball in high school and you miss it.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.320]   We have a softball team.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.440]   Maybe you tried out for the football team and you didn't make it, but you're a superstar
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.360]   at church.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   Maybe you like music.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.160]   You have an opportunity to practice your gift here.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.840]   You've always loved children.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   It's a place for you to play with children here.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:18.400]   I'm not saying that people's motives are just purely not good, but there's a lot of reasons
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:26.280]   why just even non-Christians would want to participate in the fellowship of the church.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:33.420]   But the primary reason why you and I are gathered here together is for His worship.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.160]   If you and I, and every single one of us, whether you have Facebook or not, we live
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.960]   in a part of the world where covening is rampant.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.360]   And when I say covenant, I'm not talking about the world inside of us.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.960]   Every time we turn on the TV, even on the radio, we are being sold the next big thing.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.320]   If you have iPhone 7, you need iPhone 8.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.520]   And if you have 8 for 10 months, you have trash.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.680]   You got 9 coming, you got 10.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.180]   And that's kind of like how the world works.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:08.060]   What is it that the church can possibly give that can compete with all of that?
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   All of that?
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.060]   Friendship?
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:16.800]   I mean, plenty of people go to bars and hang out and make great friends over there.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   Purpose?
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:23.960]   I mean, just give yourself to your family and make money and whatever that purpose is.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.520]   What is it that the church can offer that can compete with that?
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:37.240]   I mean, if I believe that I can give the best sermon and be so articulate that I can convince
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.640]   a group of people every single week to forsake their life and give it to Christ, I mean,
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.400]   I should be a billionaire by now if I have the ability to do that.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.920]   The only thing that the church has that can compete with the rest of the world is Christ.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.880]   Only when you gaze upon Christ, only when you are falling in love with Christ, only
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   those who believe that Christ is will look at the rest of the world and say, "That's
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   rubbish.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   I want this."
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.400]   That's why he says, "You cannot please God.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.720]   It is impossible to please God without faith, for he who comes to God must first believe
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.800]   that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.840]   He is the rewarder of those who seek him.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.320]   Not your business, not your work, not your family, not your wife, not your children,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   not your friends.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   But he is.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:41.200]   So he says to take a look, take a careful look, examine, "shaoshing," small heart.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.360]   Examine the things that naturally causes us to drift.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.040]   Secondly, he says, "To encourage one another day after day, as long as it is called today,
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.160]   so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.440]   The word for encourage, "parakaleo," to call, to aid, to help, to comfort, to encourage,
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.080]   to beseech with strong force.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.520]   The way we use the word encourage, typically, at least in our generation, encourage, we
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.800]   naturally think when somebody feels uplifted.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.840]   "Oh, he's so encouraging."
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.120]   Encouraging means like no matter what you do, he never comes down on you.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.640]   He's like, "You always feel good when you're around that person."
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.880]   The word for encourage is a neutral word.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.680]   It's neither good or bad.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.800]   It just means to strongly provoke.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   It doesn't always mean like you feel lifted.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.460]   You can be rebuked and be encouraged.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:36.240]   In Hebrews 10, 24-25, he says, "And let us consider how to stimulate," that word literally
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.960]   means to provoke one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.240]   Not forsaking our own, assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.720]   another, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.880]   Provoke one another.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.760]   Not only are we to examine ourselves carefully, we are to be in a part of a community where
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.480]   we are provoking one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:06.000]   If we're not careful, we can easily provoke one another on toward worldliness.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.200]   And you know how easily that happens.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.720]   Somebody buys a nice house, somebody buys a nice car, somebody has great travel, and
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.520]   then we look at that as part of our community and say, "Oh, I want that."
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.080]   And inside of a church where Christ is supposed to be at the center, he's only centered by
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.240]   name, but there's no true fellowship going on.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Typically, when we evaluate ourselves, we think, "Oh, I should pray more."
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.160]   I get some Bible because I get some teaching, and maybe I attend Bible studies, so I get
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   some of that.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   Evangelism, you know, I should share a little bit with my friends.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.340]   But one of the things that are truly lacking in the church is fellowship.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.200]   We deceive ourselves often if we're not careful to think we're having fellowship because I
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.880]   got together with my friends and went and watched a movie.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.120]   We play softball together with Christians.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.440]   We got together and made dumplings on Saturday.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.380]   And so therefore, we have plenty of fellowship.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:10.880]   But the word fellowship means provoking, provoking on toward God, partnering together with someone.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.800]   So the question is, when was the last time you were provoked by somebody on toward love
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.280]   and good deeds?
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.480]   When was the last time that because of that person, you were provoked?
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.400]   You know, provoked is a very strong word.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.280]   It's not just a casual response.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.240]   Just kind of like, you know, when we think of provoked in a negative way, you're provoked
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   to anger.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   Like, you don't have control.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.520]   You're just like, "Ow!"
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.620]   In a good or bad way.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.520]   When was the last time you were provoked by somebody on toward love and good deeds?
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.260]   And the other question is, when was the last time you provoked somebody because of you?
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.520]   Somebody decided to follow their life in Christ and drop what they were doing and say, "You
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520]   know what?
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   I better get my act straight."
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.740]   Or to really like, "I want to love Christ like you love Christ."
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.520]   When was the last time somebody was provoked by you?
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:09.860]   See, we can easily fool ourselves to think that we have fellowship because we're surrounded
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.680]   by Christians.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.140]   And let me ask you, you know, we have friends that we hang out with all the time, right?
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.240]   And you're a close group of friends.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.680]   When was the last time you guys sat down and really prayed for each other?
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.720]   Not because it was prayer time, not because it was meal time, but because your hunger
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.000]   for God led to that.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.160]   When was the last time that your conversation, your community that you belong to provoked
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   you?
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.720]   "Man, I really want to love Christ."
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.940]   And if you can't say that that's how your friendships are described, you're not running
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.000]   with those people.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.080]   You're living with those people.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.320]   You have community with those people, but they're not your partners.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.820]   You're not fellowshiping with those people.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.620]   In fact, when you have a lot of Christians where there's no provoking going on, it actually
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.320]   does more harm than good because it deceives us to think that fellowship is happening when
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.920]   it is not.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.720]   True fellowship requires provoking.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.200]   Now, I'm not saying provoking means like we're always examining each other and say, "Hey,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.600]   you better do this and you better do that."
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.080]   We're not saying that, right?
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.760]   First and foremost, we need to examine ourselves.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.640]   But our attitude should be in the context of community that we are constantly encouraging
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.400]   each other because that's the way God designed it.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.120]   Second Timothy chapter 2, 22-23, "Now flee from youthful lust and pursue righteousness,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.880]   faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.720]   For whatever the reason, we desire true fellowship and provoking when we first become a Christian.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.920]   We look for churches, small groups, mentors, but for whatever the reason, after we've been
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.840]   a Christian for a period, we no longer need it.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.720]   I'm strong enough.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   I know how to read the Bible.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   I know how to pray.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.840]   I've known this, and we have a tendency to be spiritually lax when it comes to fellowship.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:09.240]   Well, God designed it that we are to run together, to encourage one another, not only to examine
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:17.520]   ourselves but to encourage other people, to provoke one another as long as it is called
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   today.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.440]   Like, what does he mean by today?
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   Of course it's today.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.480]   Today is always today, right?
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:30.640]   When he says today, when the Bible oftentimes uses time, it is used as God's ordained period.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.680]   So when he says, "As long as it is called today," this ordained period, when God's calling
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.880]   you, His kindness is calling you, that is ordained today.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.560]   Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:50.200]   If you hear God's voice today, God is being gracious.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.400]   Even when He rebukes, even when He disciplines, it is the grace of God that leads us to repentance.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:02.000]   Anyone who is outside of the grace of God has no interest in the Word, has no interest
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.560]   in examining himself.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.800]   He doesn't care if he's drifting.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.560]   He doesn't care if he's not right with God.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.920]   He doesn't care if his joy does not come from God.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.760]   But those who hear, and that's why Jesus kept on saying, "He who has ears, let him hear."
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.200]   That's exactly what it's saying, "If it is called today."
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:28.760]   If God is being gracious today, do not harden your heart with deceitfulness of sin.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.240]   You know this passage, Proverbs 24, 33, 34, "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.120]   folding of the hands to rest.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.600]   Then your poverty will come as a robber and your want like an armed man."
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.040]   We oftentimes use that for physical laziness.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:52.080]   That if you're lazy physically, you're going to have poverty.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.960]   But it's true even spiritually.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.640]   You know, some of us are very diligent when it comes to physical things.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.680]   Go to the gym, work out, eat right, you're great at work, but when it comes to spiritual
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.480]   things, it's just not urgent.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.240]   It's not important enough.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.680]   And you see yourself drifting, but it's kind of like, "Heard it and done it."
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.640]   And then you allow yourself to continue to drift.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   Even the word for sin, even the word for sin can sound innocuous, hamartion.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.960]   The primary word in the Bible that describes sin is hamartion.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.520]   The word hamartion basically means to miss the mark.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:40.320]   It doesn't sound that bad because there's other words, wickedness, licentiousness, rebellion,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   pornographic.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.520]   I mean, there's plenty of words that describe sin, but the predominant word to describe
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.960]   sin is hamartion, to miss the mark.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.200]   It doesn't sound that bad because hamartion basically sounds like you tried to make an
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:02.080]   effort and you didn't get an A. You didn't get an A. I mean, B is not bad.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.280]   C is average.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.240]   D you didn't fail.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.360]   So hamartion doesn't sound that bad, but the reason why hamartion is the primary word for
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:22.240]   sin is because that little deviation from what God has desired is what caused the rebellion.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:29.040]   That's what caused the sin of mankind to live under the dominion of death.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.120]   And on the surface, it seems like it's just a mistake.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:38.440]   And that little mistake that we sweep under the rug, that we excuse, is the thing that
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:44.400]   continues to trip us up and ultimately leads to rebellion against God.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   There's a reason why Israel's grumbling against God is used primarily to warn Israel, warn
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   the church.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.720]   We say, "Hey, do not worship other gods."
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   Like, I don't worship other gods.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.800]   I come to church every Sunday.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.760]   Don't use the Lord's name in vain, saying, "Okay, I won't say God whatever anymore."
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.760]   Keep the Sabbath holy.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760]   I can do that.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   I can go to church every Sunday.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:15.400]   And if we're not careful, we can think, like, "Why take care of all of that?"
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.240]   All the while, the coveting in our hearts is rampant.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.560]   The discord, the discontent, which is causing all kinds of conflicts.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.120]   And our heart has become so dry and distant from God that the Word of God no longer makes
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.960]   any sense to you.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.400]   All the while, thinking that we're good because we've done this.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.080]   Second Thessalonians 2, 8 through 12.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.640]   Oh, sorry, it's Jeremiah 17, 9 through 10, says, "The heart is more deceitful than all
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.260]   else and is desperately sick.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.260]   Who can understand it?
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.600]   I, the Lord, search the heart.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.720]   I test the mind, even to give each man according to his ways, according to the results of his
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   deeds."
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.000]   Now, notice here, he says his heart is sick, but what does God search?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.800]   The heart, the mind, and the deed.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.920]   The heart, the mind, and the deed.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.240]   All of man.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.720]   Man's rebellion oftentimes begins inwardly.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.200]   And it is inward rebellion against God that eventually gets expressed outwardly.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:22.160]   And that's why he says, "Shawshin," small heart.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.680]   Look carefully, exam carefully.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.160]   Second Thessalonians 2, 8 through 12, "Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.440]   Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of his
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.440]   coming.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.920]   That is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.520]   and signs and false wonders, and with all the deception of wickedness for those who
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.800]   perish."
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.000]   Sin always deceives, no matter how small it is.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.120]   And it deceives us first.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:38:01.280]   The Bible says that damnation will come to those who live in deception.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.040]   He says, again, "Because they did not receive the love of the truth, so as to be saved,
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.760]   for this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence, so that they will believe
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   what is false."
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.360]   They will believe.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.840]   It's willful unbelief.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.120]   That's how it's described in Romans chapter 1, because they love the darkness.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.680]   They don't want to be exposed to the light.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.800]   They embraced it.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.920]   They will believe what is false, "in order that they all may be judged who did not believe
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness."
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.840]   Be careful.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.920]   Be careful.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:52.080]   The Christianity that we see in America has drifted so far away that if you are an average
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.440]   Christian, you may not know the Lord, if you're not careful.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.520]   We need to know our faith is genuine according to the plumb line, the word of God, not your
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:12.440]   friends, not the community, not this church, and not the leaders.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   What does the word of God say?
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.080]   That's why he says, third and finally, to persevere, "For we have become partakers of
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.840]   Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end."
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.800]   When he says, "if we hold fast," he's not saying that salvation is by works, that if
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.200]   you work hard that we're going to be saved.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.000]   Of course that's not what he's saying.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.200]   He says, "If your confession and your assurance that you started with is what you have now,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   and that this assurance, this genuine faith, is what you will have in the future."
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.240]   No one can have assurance of salvation based upon ten years ago.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.760]   I know I was sincere then.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   I had genuine faith then, even though there's no evidence of it today.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.120]   Perseverance.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.560]   Perseverance is the final test of assurance of salvation.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.420]   Is this faith real?
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:11.960]   And that's why the Bible continues to ask us, demand us, and warns us to examine yourselves.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.560]   Examine carefully.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.380]   And as you examine, to encourage, and in encouraging, to persevere.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.800]   Remember the height from which you had fallen, repent, and redo the things that you did at
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   first.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.600]   And that is the challenge that you and I are living in.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:35.680]   You may be the best Christian among your friends, and still be far off from God.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.240]   You may be the strongest person.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.680]   You may be, you may know the Bible better than anybody else that you know in your life,
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.760]   and still be way, way, way from the center of God's will.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.060]   That's the danger of where you and I are at.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.340]   And again, this is not to discourage you.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.560]   It's to reiterate the warning that is given to us.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.360]   Just like if we went to a doctor and he's examining us carefully, that we do not drift
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:08.920]   toward the world, allowing our hearts, and then eventually, other than the fact that
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.960]   we go to church and we're active, there is no true evidence.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.560]   Are you genuine worshippers of Christ?
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.240]   It is impossible to please him without faith, and he who comes to God must first believe
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:26.200]   that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.400]   I am not the standard.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.640]   Our leaders are not the standard.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.760]   Our church is not the standard.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.360]   Only his Word.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   Only his Word.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:40.600]   That didn't work.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.320]   Only his Word.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:54.360]   Again, and I know that you've heard this enough, that for many of you, it's old.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.920]   Many of you, it's old.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.120]   Time goes by so quick.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.680]   We were there yesterday with the salt and pepper people, and some in their 50s, and
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.800]   some about to hit their 60s, and a bunch of them just turning 40s, and you think about
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.920]   how quickly the 20s went, and you think about the 30s, it's like, blur, 40, you don't even
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   remember.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.720]   Like, did it happen when I was 41 or 49?
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.640]   It just goes by so quick, and so I can imagine what the 50s are going to feel like, like
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.360]   a blink.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:31.720]   It goes by so quick that if we're not careful, if we're not anchored in Christ, and we just
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.960]   kind of drift along because the current is taking us that direction, you're going to
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:44.240]   find yourself decades later waking up thinking, "What did I do with my life?"
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.720]   I pray that that is not the case with us.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:53.920]   I pray that every single one of us recognizes what it is that we have in Christ, that we
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.440]   would praise Him, love Him, follow Him, and proclaim Him to the best of our ability during
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.200]   the short life that we have together.
