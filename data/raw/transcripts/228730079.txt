[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Romans chapter 10, and it just happens that today as we send off our team, we're also
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.160]   landing on the passage on Romans chapter 10, 15.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.120]   So I'm going to read actually from verse 14 to 17, but our main focus is going to be on
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.120]   verse 15.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.320]   Romans chapter 10, verse 14 to 17.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.360]   How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed, and how are they to believe
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.240]   in him of whom they have never heard?
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.960]   And how are they to hear without someone preaching, and how are they to preach unless they are
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.200]   sent?
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.840]   As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.280]   But they have not all obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, the Lord who has believed what
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.960]   he has heard from us.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   So faith comes from hearing, the hearing through the word of Christ.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.840]   Let's pray.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.720]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.080]   We thank you for the things that we are aware of, and we thank you, Lord God, even the things
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.480]   that you are doing behind the scene that sometimes we are not aware of.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.320]   But we know that you are sovereign, that no matter how chaotic and lost we feel at times,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   we know that you are on your throne, that you are deserving of worship.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.040]   I pray, Father God, this morning that your word would search our hearts, convict us,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.440]   mold us, encourage and strengthen us, that we may live as you have saved us to do.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.880]   I pray, Father, for your grace.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.200]   I pray for your spirit, that you would be in the midst of us and that we would be aware
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   of it.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   Paul has been arguing the case of justification, and he has been saying, again, as we read
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.000]   in verse 14, how will they call on him whom they have not believed, and how are they going
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.680]   to believe in him whom they have never heard, and how are they going to hear without someone
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.560]   preaching, and how will someone preach unless they are sent?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.760]   We talked about, I think, a couple of weeks ago, why does God use feeble people like us?
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.080]   You think about, we don't have to search through church history, but if we were to
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.640]   search through church history, I think you and I would agree, it's amazing that you and
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   I are still here.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.200]   I mean, even, we're not talking about atheists, or we're not talking about Muslims, or we're
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.600]   not talking about, you know, people who are antagonistic toward the church.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.800]   We're talking about the church itself, for a large portion of our history, try to get
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.480]   rid of the Bible.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.360]   There are people within church history who are martyred, who are burned at the stake,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.240]   who had their heads beheaded, because all they wanted to do was to translate the Bible
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.760]   in modern man's English, just to get the Bible to us.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.560]   We have periods in church history where the leaders, the top leaders of the church, were
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   going around and selling salvation for money, so that they can raise more money to build
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   nicer palaces.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.320]   I mean, you talk about the corruption and the sin, I'm not talking about outside the
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.760]   church, inside the church.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.640]   But I don't even need to think, we need to think that far and look at church history.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.760]   We look at ourselves, how much we struggle.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.120]   We have a hard time understanding each other, like our own sins, our own discipline.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   Why does God use frail people like us to get the gospel out, this such important message
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.680]   where people's destinies is at stake, where someone believes they are safe for eternity,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.000]   they don't believe and they're condemned for eternity.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That why would God entrust this message to us?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   I mean, there is an element of mystery in that, because we won't fully know unless God
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.280]   spells it out for us.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   And I was wrestling and thinking about this, and there are a few things that I could think
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.320]   about, but one thing that I am absolutely certain about is that our obedience to preach
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   the gospel is directly linked to our salvation.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   It is part of our sanctification.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.420]   That God is just as concerned about our sanctification as our justification.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.680]   We have a tendency to put so much emphasis and talk and study about the justification
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.800]   of our faith, and then we just kind of like, well, you know, God wants us to live up to
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.360]   the calling, and then we just kind of leave it at that.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.280]   Of course, God wants to be holy because he is holy, but there's not enough emphasis
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.200]   on sanctification because we think if we're justified, the important part is done.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.600]   The most crucial part of our salvation has been taken care of by justification, so sanctification,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:15.360]   hopefully you'll be able to do it, to live up to the calling that you've received.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.400]   I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that God is just as concerned about our sanctification
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.480]   as he is about our justification.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.880]   I remember when I was younger how hard I worked to buy my first car.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.880]   I mean, I worked, and I was willing to do anything.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.040]   I was cleaning up, I was a janitor, I flipped burgers, and I cleaned toilets.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.220]   Sometimes I would clean from 5 o'clock to 5 o'clock next morning, just working overtime
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.300]   so I can get the extra money because I was trying to buy this car.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.120]   I bought a car for $1,650, and I drove all the way down to the valley, and I picked it
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.320]   up, and I was so proud of that car.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.040]   It was crazy, $1,650 back then, maybe a little bit more money than now, but it was still
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   a piece of junk.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.840]   It was probably equivalent to maybe $3,000 or $4,000 today, but it was still a piece
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.340]   of junk.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.640]   To me, because of the time and effort that I put in to get this car, it was my prized
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   possession.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.980]   The thing that, among every possession I owned, that was probably the most precious thing
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.960]   that I had because it represented, for me, at least two years of physical labor to get
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   that car.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.680]   When I got that car, you better believe I took care of it.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.840]   I washed that thing, and I remember waxing that piece of junk, and I was waxing it in
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.280]   front of my friend's house, and his mom came out, and she literally just laughed at me
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.920]   for waxing this piece of junk.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.320]   It was a piece of junk, but not to me, not to me because it was precious to me.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.720]   You better believe with all the effort that I put in that I didn't just buy it, and it's
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.240]   like, "Ah, this piece of junk, didn't take care of it."
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.040]   Consider Christ and what God sacrificed in order for you and I to be saved, to call him
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.180]   our Abba Father.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.300]   He didn't sacrifice his only begotten Son and then justified us, and then just kind
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.060]   of like, "Oh, hopefully you make it the rest of it."
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.820]   You better believe that he's just as concerned about our sanctification as our glorification,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.340]   that he's putting just as much effort and just as much time and energy and love that
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.980]   we would be sanctified as much as we are justified.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.780]   It's not like, "Oh, you're justified, so at least that part's taken care of, and this
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.380]   part isn't as important."
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.940]   No, it is just as important.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.500]   Now how does this relate to preaching the gospel?
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.860]   Because being obedient to preach the gospel, to be concerned for those who are not yet
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.460]   in the fold, is a crucial part of our sanctification.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.140]   We can say that it is probably the crucial backbone behind our sanctification.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.960]   Why does God tell us to be hospitable?
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.880]   Why does God tell us to be generous?
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.940]   Why does God tell us to love?
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.820]   Why does God tell us to forgive?
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:27.380]   All of this is directly linked to our obedience to the Great Commission, because you can't
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:34.000]   preach the gospel effectively if you are not participating in these things.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.500]   God uses us to bring other people to the fold, because just as much as they need to come
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.420]   to Christ, we need to be sanctified in obedience.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.660]   Just as much as Christ loves them, he wants us to love them.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.980]   It is just as important that we love them as Christ loved them.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.700]   As much as he sacrificed for them, he wants us to sacrifice for them.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.980]   As much as he grieves for the lost, he wants us to grieve for the lost.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.420]   There's a reason why God uses imperfect people like us, because it is a vital part of our
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:15.180]   salvation, it is a vital part of our sanctification.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:23.700]   This morning, as we send off our team to China, I want to encourage us, again, it may not
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:32.260]   be new, but as a reminder to us why this is such a crucial part of our walk with God.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:38.540]   I don't know about you, but I can honestly confess that when my heart is disengaged from
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.020]   the lost, it makes my preaching very difficult.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   It makes my prayers forced, like an obligation that I get to put in my time to pray.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.180]   It makes my giving, like I have to calculate, do I really need to give this?
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.160]   Do I have to give this much?
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.540]   Everything that I do is calculated, and it's just something that I need to do.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.220]   And my heart is disengaged with the lost.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:12.660]   But when my heart is engaged with the lost, everything that I'm doing makes so much sense.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.220]   My prayers become desperate.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.460]   My fellowship with my brothers and sisters, it becomes crucial.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.440]   My giving is not sacrifice, it's participating.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.260]   Why God sends us, it is directly linked.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.260]   It's not simply for the salvation of the lost.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.060]   It's also for our own salvation.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.580]   As we are saved, and as Scripture says, we are being saved.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:47.140]   So I want to talk about why it is so important for us.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:55.600]   One, the Great Commission is a vital part of our identity.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.120]   The Great Commission is a vital part of our identity.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.080]   I remember years ago, I had a discussion with another brother, he was attending a different
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   church, and he was saying how God didn't call all of us to the Great Commission.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.200]   And he was, for whatever the reason, his pastor was telling his congregation that the Great
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.080]   Commission was just a commission for the disciples, not for us.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.760]   And there is a case that he can make for that, because it's in the context of God commissioning
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.120]   the apostles to go preach the gospel to the most part of the world.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.960]   God didn't call every single one of us specifically to take the gospel to the jungle, or to China,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.120]   or to Japan, specifically speaking.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.920]   But the general call to preach the gospel is an identity.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.080]   It's at the core of who we are.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.800]   In 1 Peter 2, 9 it says, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.480]   people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.120]   you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.240]   Did you see that?
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:07.040]   He said, not only have we become his possession, a holy nation, he said, all of this happened
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:19.080]   Our very identity as a Christian is an ambassador for Christ.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.580]   That's who we are.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:28.900]   If you are a businessman and you don't sell anything, then you're not a businessman.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.440]   If you're a student and you never go to class and you don't own any books, then you're not
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.380]   a student.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.400]   Just because you sign up doesn't make you a student.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   You need to go to class.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   You need to study.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.960]   And in the same way, he says, we have become a holy nation, a royal priesthood.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.320]   Our whole purpose of why you and I are here is not, you know, I saved you so now you can
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.080]   enjoy the time between now until you get to heaven, and then you can enjoy heaven some
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.740]   more.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.080]   For whatever the reason, the church in our generation believes that that's the case.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.800]   Just kind of enjoy the time that we have.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.820]   Just ride this out until we get to heaven.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:12.000]   He says the reason why he saved us is ultimately to save others.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.400]   Our salvation is connected to the salvation of whoever next is coming.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.280]   This generation is responsible for the souls in this generation.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.040]   The next generation is going to be responsible for the souls in the next generation.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.120]   We have been saved in order that we may proclaim the excellencies of him who called us out
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.560]   of darkness.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.760]   So first, the Great Commission is a vital part of our identity.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.360]   Secondly, the very definition of the gospel, the very definition of our salvation requires
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.860]   that we proclaim it.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.180]   The very definition of our salvation.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.460]   To say that you are a Christian, that you believe the gospel, requires that we are proclaimers
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.460]   of the gospel.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:01.140]   The word euangelion is literally good news.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.060]   You could tell if something is a good news or not a good news based upon the ways that
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.980]   person shares it.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.340]   If somebody comes to you and says, "Man, I have some news," and their demeanor gets
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.960]   really dark, and you're trying to crack jokes and they don't laugh, right?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.720]   And there's a seriousness about their demeanor, and you can already tell this isn't good
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   news.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.460]   What's going on?
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.740]   But you can also tell by the way that they're about to present it to you that it's good
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   news.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.380]   And based upon their body language and their facial expression, you can tell that it is
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.500]   fantastic news, that he can't wait to tell you.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.900]   He's building it up to tell you, because he knows the moment you hear it that you're going
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.620]   to be just as transformed as he is.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.620]   See, that's the definition of euangelion, good news.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.760]   They use that word good news.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.380]   It was a very specific cultural word that the Christians adopted for the gospel message,
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:09.620]   and it was simply used to declare a victory in...if your nation went to war and your soldiers
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.980]   came back, and they said, "Did you win or lose?"
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.860]   We won!
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.940]   That's the context where they used the word euangelion, good news.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:26.680]   So the very definition of this term requires that we proclaim it.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.860]   If we say we believe in the good news and to never proclaim it, doesn't that...doesn't
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.200]   your body language and doesn't your life itself and doesn't the way you share it or don't
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.140]   share it, doesn't that automatically tell the recipient that it may be not good news?
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.160]   At least not to you.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.680]   Maybe the content in and of itself objectively is good news, but clearly you don't believe
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.240]   it.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.440]   Because if we believe it is good news, I don't know about you, but how many times has
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.480]   something really good happened to you and you told nobody?
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.600]   You got this job that you've been praying for years and you got this job, and then your
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.680]   best friend you have lunch with, he said, "What happened?"
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.440]   "Eh, don't want to talk about it."
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.320]   You go home and your mom is waiting, "What happened?"
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.960]   "Eh, I'd rather keep it to myself."
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:32.120]   When was the last time something fantastic happened and you just weren't eager to tell
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.440]   anybody about it?
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:42.080]   Something in and of itself, the very thing that we examine, it's very strange for Christians
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.500]   to embrace the gospel and not to be eager to tell other people about it.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:55.160]   So we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, "Why am I not eager to tell other people?"
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.400]   To say that I have embraced and believed and I confess and I sing and I memorize and I
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.720]   study that I have embraced and I've been changed by this good news.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.960]   I'm living because of this good news.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   And then so nonchalant about telling other people about it.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.620]   The very nature of the gospel itself, the very definition of the gospel itself, it means
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.640]   to proclaim, to teach.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.440]   And that's exactly what Jesus said in Luke chapter 4, 8 through 19, "The Spirit of the
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.200]   Lord has appointed me because he has anointed me to proclaim the good news to the poor.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.560]   He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:45.280]   to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:53.920]   The gospel isn't gospel until we recognize that we are poor.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.200]   Jesus said he had come to bring good news to the poor.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.480]   But what if you don't know that you're poor?
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.240]   He says he came to proclaim liberty to the captives.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:15.720]   What if your belief of captivity is just a theory?
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.860]   You didn't even know that you were captive.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.480]   He says he had come to bring recovery to the sight to the blind.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.000]   What if you're seeing fine and you don't know that you're blind?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.440]   He said he has come to set liberty to those who are oppressed.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.180]   I've never felt oppressed in my life.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.600]   So how does good news become good news to those people who have never been poor, who
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:52.520]   have never been captive, who have never felt like they were blind, and never felt oppressed?
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:59.760]   What is going to attract people to the Savior and cry out to the Savior saying, "Save
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:06.720]   me," if I don't necessarily feel the need to be saved?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.120]   That's the challenge of the gospel in where you and I live.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.680]   You go to people who are dying of hunger.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.880]   I mean, you say Christ came to set the captives free and they're being oppressed.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.360]   It's like, "Yes, can he save me?"
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.840]   And there's a desperation that causes them to cry out to God.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.560]   And they have their own set of issues because sometimes they interpret every deliverance
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.040]   as food and money.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:36.360]   But in our generation, in where you and I live, how do we convince people that this
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   is good news?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   Just theoretically, when we die, we're going to go to heaven, right?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   Because we all know we're going to die.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.600]   See, that's the exact problem that the Jews had in John chapter 8.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   People who thought, "Yeah, he's the Messiah," but Jesus said to those who had believed him,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.200]   he said, "If you abide in my truth, if you abide in my word, you shall know the truth
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.360]   and truth shall set you free."
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   And then they became angry.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   Set free?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.240]   We've never been a slave.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.040]   Why do we even need to be set free?
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.120]   And then this discussion goes back and forth.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.420]   And they rejected Christ because Jesus said, "I have come to set the captives free.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.320]   If the Son sets you free, you'll be free indeed."
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.440]   It's like, "Why do I need freedom?
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.680]   I've never been free."
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.840]   So they came to Jesus thinking that he's going to make them great.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.640]   He's going to somehow pat them on the back and say, "Hey, you've been doing a great job
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.960]   obeying the law."
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.600]   But yet when Jesus said, "You need to be set free," they're like, "Set free?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   From what?"
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Gospel, the good news is the only good news.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:55.040]   If we see through his eyes what he sees, if we believe that spiritually we are poor, that
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:03.160]   because of our sins we become captives, that without his help we are absolutely blind.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   No matter how much education you have, no matter how much you study the Bible, without
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   his grace, without his salvation, we are absolutely blind and desperate and needy.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.360]   That we are susceptible of oppression.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.260]   There is an enemy who are roaring around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour,
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.400]   and I am absolutely helpless without my Savior.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:38.640]   So the good news only is good news to those people who actually believe that.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.560]   If you don't believe that, the gospel is theology.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.880]   It is theory.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.480]   It is something that we need to do because I want to make sure that when I die that,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.160]   because clearly I'm going to die.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   That's 100% fact.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.920]   I want to make sure that when I die that I go to heaven instead of hell.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   That part I've kind of, you know, I want that as an insurance.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.740]   But how does the gospel actually change us?
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.080]   It changes the way we live.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.300]   It changes the way we see money.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.200]   It changes what we value and what we pursue, what we're entertained by, what is okay and
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.600]   not okay to watch.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.760]   How does it actually practically change us?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.600]   It changes us when we believe that it is the good news, that He actually is setting us
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.720]   free.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:40.360]   See, proclaiming the gospel is at the core of who we are.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:50.640]   Nothing, in comparison to eternity, nothing that you are pursuing, whether it's your career,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.680]   well-being for your children, your safety, a nice house, all of these things are not
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:05.600]   sinful things, but nothing that we pursue is as important as people's souls.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.200]   Nothing.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.520]   Nothing.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:18.800]   Nothing that we come and cling to God for and pray, pray for safety, pray for security,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:26.120]   pray for health, praying even for our very lives, isn't as important as the souls.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.840]   Because as Christians, we believe when we die, we're going to go to heaven.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.280]   So while we live, what is it that we pursue, what is it that we passionately pursue that
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:43.080]   is as important as pursuing lost souls to get this good news out to people who do not
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   know?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:53.320]   It is at the very core of who we are, the very essence of what we proclaim, and very
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.720]   core of what we study.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.080]   Third, the love of God compels us.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.480]   The love of Christ compels us.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.000]   Second Corinthians 5, 14 to 15, it says, "For the love of Christ controls us."
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.720]   The NIV, it says, "Compels us."
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:15.480]   It forces us to move forward because we have concluded that one has died for all, therefore
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.040]   all have died.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.240]   And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:32.040]   That those who live because of Christ may no longer live for themselves, but for him
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:37.160]   who for their sake died and was raised.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.880]   Love of Christ compels us.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.200]   The songs that we sing, it compels us.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.580]   The study of Christ compels us.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.520]   The preaching of his word, it compels us.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.040]   All that we do week after week compels us.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.200]   You know the passage in Matthew 9, 36 to 38 where Jesus, after preaching, he sees the
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.940]   multitude and he says he has compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.080]   like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.360]   Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the labors are few.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:21.200]   Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out labors into his harvest."
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:28.000]   While I was coming here this morning, I saw this tiny little puppy, the cutest little
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.160]   poodle looking puppy, but for whatever reason it was separated from its owner.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.800]   And as I was driving here, I was like, "Wow, that's a little cute puppy.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.880]   Well, where's the owner?"
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.000]   And then as soon as I was driving by, a car came and just ran it over.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.680]   And it died instantly.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.200]   Now I just made up that story.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.000]   I just made up that story.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.040]   Sometimes we have more compassion for a dog that dies, and yet you and I live in a context
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:10.060]   of souls who are dying every single day, and there is no awe and shock.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.440]   There is no movement.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.720]   We think about orphans who don't need more than women to give.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.960]   We think about animal cruelty, and it moves us.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.360]   Something needs to happen, and it's shocking.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:37.560]   But why do we profess to believe in a damnation of souls, and we have become accustomed to
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:44.160]   living in the midst of non-Christians, and there's no movement in our heart to bring
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.720]   the gospel to them?
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.200]   And it doesn't bother us.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.120]   Something strange has happened to the church.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.760]   Something very strange that's inconsistent with what we profess to believe has happened,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.600]   and it has become a normal part of who we are.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:12.480]   A non-Christian who will open up the scriptures and read what it says and then reads the church,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   I think will have a very difficult time believing that this, what you and I participate in,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.080]   is the same as what I see in this.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.840]   Love of Christ compels us.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.440]   What will compel us?
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.620]   Because when we look at lost souls, do we really believe everything that we've been
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.580]   studying in Revelation?
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.400]   That there is judgment coming, that Christ comes, he's not bringing flowers and commendations
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:51.180]   and medals to pass out, that when Christ comes, there's going to be fiery judgment, a third
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.020]   of the nation will be wiped out, and all of that is a warning for them to repent because
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.860]   the real judgment is going to come at the end?
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.820]   What will cause us to look at them with compassion?
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:12.780]   What will cause us to have the same feeling that you had of this dog that's been run over?
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.660]   How?
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.140]   How can we let this happen?
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.220]   What a tragedy.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:32.020]   Until we see them in faith, that we see them through Christ's eyes, that as he saw them,
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.460]   he didn't see a bunch of people who were just kind of lost and didn't have health care,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.520]   you know, they didn't make enough money.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:46.180]   He saw people who were beaten and harassed, sheep without a shepherd, and he had compassion,
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.060]   he was moved.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.020]   And so he told his disciples, "Beseech the Lord of the harvest."
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:59.340]   When was the last time you cried out?
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.340]   You cried out to God.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.660]   Not because you were hurt, not because somebody in your family member was sick, but you cried
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:22.580]   out for a lost soul, begging God to save them.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:28.900]   There's something about that that doesn't make sense.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:36.740]   Now maybe if I just stop talking about it, that we don't have to think about it.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.260]   But how could we not?
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:48.620]   Either you reject this gospel, reject it and say you don't believe it, reject it and say,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.420]   I'll take some part of it, but I don't receive the other part of it.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.500]   I want to receive the religious part of it, I want to receive the benefits of it, but
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.100]   I don't want to receive all of it.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:04.300]   At least have integrity and say, I don't receive all of it.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.420]   Then at least it would be consistent.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:15.380]   But you can't say that you receive all of it, you believe all of it.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.900]   And then not tell other people.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.300]   And to be worried about tomorrow like everybody else.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.140]   To cry out.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:33.500]   Non-Christians pray when they're sick.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   Even athletes who live in sin will pray before their final game because they desperately
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.440]   want it.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.580]   Even atheists will cry out in a sinking boat.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:31:00.140]   Only people who really believe the Gospel; all of it, the judgement, the wrath, the grace,
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:11.920]   the mercy, the salvation, the sacrifice, the suffering, the reward, eternity.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:23.280]   Only people who really believe that will ever really cry out to God.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.000]   Because the tragedy that is coming upon this earth, if the world does not repent, is not
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.820]   something any one of us even want to imagine.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:45.080]   And the only salvation for that is Christ crucified.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:56.120]   Either we embrace this truth and pick up our cross and follow Him or reject it and be consistent.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:06.160]   But you cannot, I cannot and you cannot with a clear face say, "I believe this, but I'm
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.640]   going to do this."
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.960]   Love of Christ compels us.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:25.440]   I pray that the Word of Christ may be stuck in your hearts.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.080]   You can nullify me.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   Pastor Peter's always on this hobby horse.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.200]   And you can just, well, he says things like that because that's his personality.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.640]   He's just like that.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.880]   He just kind of, whatever he gets into, he gets really into it.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   So he's just like that.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.400]   So you can nullify the message by nullifying me, right?
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:48.640]   But you're not going to be able to nullify His Word.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.880]   Look carefully into His Word.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.200]   Something strange has happened to Christianity in our generation.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.880]   It just doesn't fit what we profess.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.080]   It doesn't fit what we sing.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.680]   It doesn't fit our lives.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.200]   The love of Christ compels us.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.600]   The people in China are dying without Christ.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.920]   People in India are dying without ever even hearing that there is hope in the name of
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.880]   Jesus.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.040]   And there's people in Orange County that never even had the opportunity to reject the gospel
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.520]   because they don't know what the gospel is.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.280]   They're surrounded by Christians every single day.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.240]   But you ask them what the gospel is, they don't know.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   What is Christianity?
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   Well, you believe in Jesus, go to church.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.520]   He's like, no.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   What is Christianity?
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.920]   Well, you try to be a good person and not to hurt people.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.340]   No.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.840]   We live among people who are under God's condemnation and the wrath of God is coming
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.360]   upon them.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.000]   It may come tomorrow, it may come 10 years from now, it may come 60 years from now, but
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.760]   for sure it will come if they die without Christ.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:20.400]   And then to just block this off is inconsistent with what we profess.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.560]   The love of Christ compels us.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.860]   I'm going to give you three quick things and then we're going to take some time to pray
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.960]   for our China team.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.720]   How do we better prepare ourselves to be sent?
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.320]   We need to become better vessels for God to use, 2 Timothy 2.20.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.280]   Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.240]   some for an honorable use, some for dishonorable.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.460]   Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:55.160]   for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   good work.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.440]   Now, do we all struggle with sin?
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.760]   My guess is yes, to a certain degree.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.880]   Some of us may be internal, some of us it may be external.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.640]   But why holiness matters?
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:15.880]   Because if you're not living a life holy, acceptable to God, I guarantee you all your
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:21.320]   prayers is going to be for God's mercy upon you.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.200]   All your prayers is going to be, "Lord, be gracious to me."
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.480]   But you will have no energy to cry out for the lost.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.880]   You have no compassion for the lost because all of your energy is focused on you.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   He says if you want to be used for noble purposes, he says get rid of the ignoble things that
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.280]   God may use us for noble purposes.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.240]   Holiness matters in evangelism.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.600]   Holiness matters in our sanctification, in our salvation.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   It matters.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:58.520]   And let me just be blunt and say holiness, what you watch, it matters.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.200]   What you listen to, it matters.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.560]   Where you go, it matters.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.480]   It does matter.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.400]   How you spend money, does it matter?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.600]   No, it matters.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.960]   It matters a lot.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.760]   But that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:19.960]   He says if you invest in ignoble things, you will not be prepared for noble purposes.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.840]   Holiness matters.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.240]   It does matter.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.920]   Secondly, we need to master his word.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.500]   Not just pastors, not just leaders, every Christian needs to master the word.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.680]   Because if we are there to proclaim the gospel truth and you know nothing of Christ other
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:48.440]   than what you've been told, your connection to Christ is just as weak as it was when you
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.680]   first started.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.600]   That's why when your friends disappear, you disappear.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.380]   When your support system is gone, you're gone.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:02.640]   When the external things, the events and all these things disappear, you also disappear.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.400]   Because your connection to Christ is hanging on a thin thread.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.080]   Because it is not yours.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   I look at my kids as they're growing up.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.880]   I'm trying to give them more and more freedom because I want them to have their own faith.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.000]   I don't want them to say, "Well, your dad's a pastor, so you should know all of this stuff."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.640]   At some point, they need to be tested, and they need to come to the word of God, and
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.500]   they need to confess.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:31.000]   Because if they don't, at some point when all the support system is gone, they're also
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.200]   going to be gone.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.320]   Every single one of us has to master his word.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.960]   Because 2 Timothy 3:16, it says, "All Scripture is breathed out by God, and it's profitable
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.040]   for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, that the man
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.520]   of God may be competent."
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.040]   In the NIV, it says, "Thoroughly equipped for every good work."
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:38:00.680]   The word for equipped, ex arteso, it means to equip, to outfit, and to furnish.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.600]   Whenever we think about sending people out to missions or evangelism, we always think
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.160]   about, "Well, what's the training?"
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:15.840]   And the training typically involves contextualization, communicating cross-culturally, like knowing
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.040]   what their bent is.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.920]   And so all of these things are necessary things, but the only thing that we were taught in
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.560]   Scripture that we needed was his word and the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:31.260]   So all this other stuff is great that we have it, but it doesn't make you any less effective
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.400]   if you don't have it, because it was not ordained by God.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.480]   What was ordained was his word, preaching of his word.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.040]   Faith comes from hearing, and the hearing of the word of Christ.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.600]   So the more effective you are in knowing and proclaiming his word, the more effective you
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.880]   are, the more trained you are.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.540]   We need to become experts of his word.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.800]   You notice how he says that, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news."
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   He didn't say, "People who have beautiful feet preach good news."
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:14.000]   That may sound like semantics, but the difference is, if we're looking for people who are articulate,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.120]   who have influence, who have certain gifts, who have a certain amount of knowledge, a
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:27.160]   certain amount of seminary training, no, he says, "Those who preach the good news, they
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.600]   have beautiful feet."
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:36.200]   How often do we look for beautiful feet to preach the good news?
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.460]   He has ordained his word.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.400]   And then finally, we need to pray, and we want to take some time to do that this morning
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.120]   for our team that's going out, and even for ourselves.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.560]   We need to pray.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.480]   Pray that the door may be opened.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.240]   When we first went out to China, it felt like God just kicked the door wide open, and he
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   said, "Come.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.800]   We need people to come."
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.880]   And so it wasn't because there was a great heart for China, or there was this love that
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   God opened up.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   It was like, no, there was a need.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   The door was open.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   So come.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.760]   So that's why we went, and we've been going there ever since.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   Right now, the door's starting to open in India.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   It's not this, like, "Whoa, Indian culture and Indian food.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.080]   It'd be great to go to India."
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.220]   No, the door's been opened.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.560]   So we're trying to go to India.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.160]   We'll see where God leads us with that.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   But there's also, as the door for the country is open, that we're praying that God would
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.400]   open the doors of people.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.040]   So we want to take some time to pray for the people who are going, that God would lead
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.560]   them to people who have open hearts, that they're eager to hear and have conversations,
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.680]   that people who are searching, that God would lead them to them, that they're not forcing
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.240]   a conversation.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:59.520]   So let's pray for open doors, as Paul prays for open doors in Colossians 4.3.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.680]   Pray that the people who are going would have boldness to share.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.000]   Not to force it, but to be wise.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.760]   But when they are able to share, that they would not be afraid of the response.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.600]   They would not be afraid what kind of response that they're going to get.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.560]   As it says in Ephesians 6.19, and also Paul says, "Pray for me, that words may be given
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.680]   to me in opening my mouth, boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel."
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.280]   To boldly proclaim, to give them boldness.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.720]   There's one thing that I see over and over again in the book of Acts, is when the Holy
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.400]   Spirit comes upon them, they are bold.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   So let's pray for their teams that they would be bold in preaching the gospel while they're
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.880]   there for three weeks.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:50.560]   Thirdly, pray that they will have wisdom in how and to who they speak to.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.920]   James 1, 5, and 6, it says, "If anyone lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.160]   to all without reproach, and it will be given to him."
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.440]   So whether they are articulate or not articulate, or been to China and talked to before, or
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.920]   used to sharing the gospel or not, that God miraculously, supernaturally, will give them
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.080]   the exact words that they need, and the conversation will be led to that.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.840]   Fourthly, pray that the gospel may spread rapidly, and that there will be a sense of
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:26.120]   urgency, for them and for us.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.680]   That we would pray for urgency in the gospel.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.360]   In 2 Thessalonians 3, 1, Paul says, "Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.200]   the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored just as it was with you."
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.240]   Again, this is something that we have to fight against, because there is no sense of urgency
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:47.800]   in us, because our needs are taken care of, until God sometimes will bring discipline
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:53.320]   in our lives, and force us to see that there's an urgency, that our life is short, whether
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.920]   it's through somebody's sickness, or we get fired from a job, or something tragic happens.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.280]   But when we see the gospel as it is, and we see it with eyes of faith, that God would
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.880]   give us a sense of urgency.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.640]   God give them a sense of urgency, that the short time that they have there, that they
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.480]   would maximize it for God's glory.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.280]   And then, finally, pray that the Holy Spirit would use the foolishness of the preaching
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.080]   to bring people to Christ, that the souls may be one.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   So let's do this.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.120]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up, and we're going to take just a few minutes
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.760]   to come before the Lord.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:35.280]   And can we put all that back up?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.720]   And I want you guys to take just a few minutes to pray, maybe about two, three minutes, to
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.600]   pray over these things.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.200]   And our worship team is going to come and lead us.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.440]   Instead of just me giving you some time to just pray randomly over your things, but take
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:56.400]   some time to pray over our team, over ourselves, over the preaching of the gospel, that God
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.040]   would really send, that we would be the ones who send them, and that God would send us
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   as well.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.480]   Let's take some time to pray as our team leads us.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
